"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Scientific Beta US ETF (Symbol: SCIU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $33.39 per unit.


With SCIU trading at a recent price near $30.47 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.58% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of SCIU's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Digital Realty Trust Inc (Symbol: DLR), (Symbol: LBTYA), and Gilead Sciences Inc (Symbol: GILD). Although DLR has traded at a recent price of $131.43/share, the average analyst target is 12.72% higher at $148.15/share. Similarly, LBTYA has 10.21% upside from the recent share price of $21.84 if the average analyst target price of $24.07/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting GILD to reach a target price of $81.94/share, which is 9.61% above the recent price of $74.76. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DLR, LBTYA, and GILD:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"y John MillerSunrise Communications Group  and French billionaire Xavier Niel's Salt Mobile launched a broadband joint venture on Tuesday targeting 1.5 million Swiss households, a new challenge to the country's largest telecoms provider, Swisscom's .The former rivals pledged to invest up to 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.1 billion) over the next 5-7 years in a ""fiber to the home"" platform focused on underserved areas.According to Switzerland's regulator, Swisscom had 51.3% broadband market share to close 2018, compared to 11.5% by Sunrise and 17.7% by Liberty Global's  UPC.Sunrise Chief Executive Andre Krause said the joint venture, called Swiss Open Fiber, aimed to take on a large minority financial partner and talks with investors had begun. It comes as movement restrictions to halt the spread of COVID-19 underscore the role of home broadband, with many of Switzerland's 8.6 million people working from home.Sunrise said it would get support in set-up and operating activities from Swiss Fibre Net, which is owned by shareholders including Lucerne and Bern utilities and is pushing an independent broadband network accessible to all providers.""While Salt and Sunrise will act as anchor tenants, the infrastructure network will be offered to all retail operators,"" Sunrise said.The joint venture will be headed by Marc Furrer, head of Switzerland's federal telecommunications regulator until 2016.""Swisscom has practically a monopoly in 'fiber to the home',"" Furrer said. ""Movement will come into the market only with infrastructure competition.""Swisscom did not comment directly on the deal, but said it had invested about 16 billion francs in networks and information technology in the last 10 years, including landlines to about 74% of all homes and businesses in Switzerland.Krause ruled out a renewed Sunrise-Salt merger bid after Swiss authorities blocked a merger with Salt predecessor Orange a decade ago. ""That's not something we're planning to do,"" he said on a call.In a previous attempt to gain broadband infrastructure, Sunrise made a $6.3 billion bid for UPC before the Swiss company's shareholders blocked it last year.

Swiss Open Fiber will work with Swiss Fibre Net, an existing joint venture of local energy providers in Switzerland, which is due to support the new partnership's set-up and operating activities, Sunrise said.""While Salt and Sunrise will act as anchor tenants, the infrastructure network will be offered to all retail operators to enable them to provide their customers with ultrafast broadband connectivity services,"" Sunrise said in a statement, adding that talks had begun with potential equity partners and financing banks.The joint venture will be headed by Marc Furrer, the former head of Switzerland's federal telecommunications regulator until 2016.

                Vodafone Group stock soared on Tuesday as the world’s second-largest mobile phone operator maintained its dividend to the relief of investors.The stock (ticker: VOD. U.K.) climbed 8.3%, to 122.42 pence, in London trading on Tuesday. Its dividend had been seen as under threat as a result of the coronavirus crisis and the prospect of a megamerger between Liberty Global’s Virgin Media and Telefónica’s O2.More than 40 FTSE 100 companies, including Vodafone’s rival 
                BT (BT.A.UK) and the world’s biggest dividend payer
                 Royal Dutch Shell (RDS. B), have cut shareholder payouts amid the pandemic.Vodafone, however, kept its dividend payment steady at 9 euro cents  a share as it reported growing revenue and profit in its full-year results. (While based in England, Vodafone reports in euros, not pounds.) The company reported underlying free cash flow of €5.7 billion and expected underlying free cash flow to be at least €5 billion next year. The company swung to a pretax profit of €795 million in the year ending March 31, compared with a loss of €2.61 billion the previous year — it reported a net loss of €455 million. Group revenue climbed 3%, to €45 billion, driven by commercial momentum in Europe, where it is the largest mobile operator, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 2.6%, to €14.9 billion.Despite telecom companies appearing resilient in the face of the pandemic, Vodafone said it was “not immune to the challenges” of coronavirus. It said roaming revenues were being hit by lower international travel and expected economic pressures to affect customer revenue over time. The company offered no formal guidance for the 2021 financial year, citing uncertainty, but said that adjusted Ebitda may be “flat to slightly down” compared with the rebased 2020 baseline of €14.5 billion. Plans to separate its European towers business remain on track, and Vodafone said it was preparing for a potential initial public offering early in 2021.
                Looking ahead. Vodafone is a top 10 FTSE 100 dividend payer so the move to stick to its shareholder payout will be rejoiced by investors. The company’s revenue, profit and cash flow boost has enabled it to do that, while many others have been forced to cut. Longer term, Vodafone will have to battle with a new competitor in the form of a merged Virgin Media and O2 — as Liberty Global and Telefónica merge their U.K. operations. The new entity will combine mobile network and fixed-line broadband, while Vodafone remains a mobile-only operator. In fact, many of its major markets—Germany, Spain and the U.K. - are intensely competitive.Still, with the monetization of the European towers businesses to come, revenues climbing, and the dividend intact, UBS analyst Polo Tang says there are enough positives for Vodafone to “reverse its recent underperformance versus the sector.” He gave the stock a Buy rating with a target price of 190 pence.

"Investors in Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options become available today, for the July 24th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new July 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $20.50 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $20.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $20.45 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $22.20/share today.

Because the $20.50 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.24% return on the cash commitment, or 1.78% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares, and highlighting in green where the $20.50 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $23.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $22.20/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $23.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.83% if the stock gets called away at the July 24th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $23.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $23.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

" look at the day ahead from senior markets correspondent Tommy Wilkes. The views expressed are his own.Stronger than-expected Chinese export numbers might boost speculation that the Asian giant's economy can recover quickly and come to the aid of global growth. But markets gave the figures only a cautious welcome, focusing perhaps on the double-digit fall in imports as a reflection of collapsing demand.Another warning on the world economic outlook came from the Bank of England which said the coronavirus crisis could cause the biggest economic slump in 300 years.Markets are also wary of developments in Turkey where the lira has fallen to a record low of 7.25 against the U.S. dollar. With a Federal Reserve policymaker essentially ruling out a swap line to Ankara and net currency reserves at just around $25 billion, fears are growing for the external debt maturing this year and the risk that Turkey could set off a fresh wave of emerging market crises.World stocks were up slightly in early London trading, with European bourses rising between 0.4% and 0.6% and Wall Street looking set for a positive open after a late plunge on Wednesday. After their April bounce, stocks have struggled for direction – the moves in many countries to relax restrictions on commerce are increasingly priced in, and the horrendous economic and corporate news keeps on coming.Underscoring the edginess, the Japanese yen – still the go-to safe-haven currency – traded at seven-week highs of 106 against the dollar amid grim newsflow and a ratcheting up of U.S-China trade tensions. President Donald Trump said he could say in a week or two whether China was fulfilling its obligations under a trade deal signed in January.Elsewhere in currency markets, sterling ticked higher towards $1.24 after the Bank of England held fire on pumping more quantitative easing into Britain's economy. But with two of nine policymakers voting for 100 billion pounds’ more of bond-buying, the direction of travel is clearly for more easing. In what it called an illustrative scenario, the BOE sees a 14% plunge in Britain’s economy in 2020.Adding to the mounting list of record or near-record output declines, Germany industry output plunged 9.2% in March, its fastest rate of decline since records began in 1991. Later on Thursday we get another set of U.S. jobless claims -- expected to show a further 3 million rise. Friday's April payrolls data meanwhile should show 22 million Americans pushed into unemployment. The jobless rate is expected at 16% or more, erasing more than a decade of job gains.In Europe, Italian government borrowing costs have risen above the psychologically-important 2% level for the first time in two weeks, following a ruling by Germany's constitutional court ruling that could jeopardise further ECB bond-buying.The ruling, with potential to shake the very foundations of the European Union, has also hurt the euro, which holds near two-week lows. In commodity markets, crude oil prices had a more measured start to trading, with Brent crude down 1% at $29.4 a barrelFor European corporates, the now regular round of pulled 2020 earnings guidance and dramatic revenue drops was punctured by an M&A deal -  Telefonica  will merge British unit O2 with Virgin Media, owned by Liberty Global . That creates a British telecoms giant, with O2 valued at 12.7 billion pounds and Virgin Media at 18.7 billion pounds, including debt.On dividends, BT  suspended its dividend until 2021/22 while HeidelbergCement  slashed dividend proposals. Equinor  suspended its 2020 oil and gas output guidance.A busy earnings day too: Norwegian Air  passenger volumes fell 99% in April y-o-y. Also in airlines, British Airways-owner IAG  said flights could return to service in July and that it has 10 billion euros of liquidity available. Other revenue drops were more modest: Osram  said revenues decreased by 4.7% to 821 million euros.In emerging markets, the brewing Turkish crisis aside, stocks were broadly flat as Chinese export numbers took some pressure off manufacturers in the world's second-largest economy.As regards the other emerging market pain point, Argentina, a group of 138 economists from 20 countries, including Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Edmund S. Phelps, urged bondholders to take a ""constructive approach"" to Argentina's debt restructuring proposal.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@MORNING BID-Turkey, trade tensions, terrible data@2020-05-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/morning-bid-turkey-trade-tensions-terrible-data-2020-05-07

                BT stock tumbled 6% on Thursday, as the telecom giant suspended its dividend until 2022 to free up cash to cover the rising costs of the 5G rollout.The third cut in the company’s history delivered another blow to investors, as BT shareholders will now miss out on an estimated £3.3 billion in the coming years.More than 40 FTSE 100 companies have now cut dividends so far this year amid the coronavirus crisis, including the world’s biggest dividend payer, oil giant Royal Dutch Shell.However, BT’s problems don’t center on the pandemic but revolve around a number of longer-held issues, such as the sprawling costs of 5G and fiber broadband as well as widening pension deficit. The merger between Virgin Media owner Liberty Global and O2 owner Telefónica, announced on Thursday, creates a new major rival to BT, adding the company’s concerns.

                BT Could Be Next to Cut Dividends But It Won’t Be Down to Coronavirus 
            In its full-year results on Thursday, BT announced plans to increase its fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) target to reach 20 million households by the mid-to-late 2020s — 5 million more than its initial target. It also launched a new five-year modernization program, costing £1.3 billion but aimed at delivering £2 billion in annual savings by 2025.Chief Executive Philip Jansen said: “In order to deal with the potential consequences of Covid-19, allow us to invest in FTTP and 5G, and to fund a major five-year modernization program, we have also taken the difficult decision to suspend the dividend until 2022 and re-base thereafter.”Shortly after Jansen took the top job in February 2019, he said he was committed to maintaining the dividend this year — at 15.4p per share — despite speculation of a cut amid falling profits.But on Thursday the former Worldpay boss suspended the final dividend for last year and all dividends for the coming year, adding that when dividends resume in 2021/22 they could be halved to an annual rate of around 7.7p per share.
                AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould estimated the move would save BT around £3.3 billion, leaving “income-hungry shareholders merely with the hope that there will be some long-term gain after this considerable short-term pain.”BT’s net debt climbed to £17.96 billion as of Dec. 31, £6.9 billion higher than a year earlier, driven by pension scheme contributions, dividend payments and £2.9 billion capital expenditure, which included 5G and fiber investments. Full-year revenue fell 2.1% to £22.9 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization fell 3% to £7.9 billion. “Covid-19 is affecting our business, but the full impact will only become clearer as the economic consequences unfold over the next 12 months. Due to Covid-19, BT is not providing guidance for 2020/21, at this time,” Jansen said. BT said it was seeing lower revenue from its BT Sport unit, which broadcasts Premier League and Champions League football, in the financial year that started on Apr. 1
                Looking ahead. The coronavirus pandemic and more than 40 other FTSE 100 companies cutting dividends has provided cover for BT to halt shareholder payouts. European telecom companies, including France’s Orange, have also cut dividends, despite the sector’s defensive nature and perceived ability to sail through the coronavirus crisis. BT’s cut isn’t about coronavirus and despite the disappointment for investors, it seems sensible given the need to invest in key infrastructure and the company’s debt and pension deficit. Britain’s biggest telecoms group now has another problem — and fierce competitor — in the face of Virgin Media and O2’s proposed merger. The stock has lost more than 75% of its value in the past five years, and it is going to be another tough 18 months ahead for investors.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@BT Stock Tumbles as Telecoms Giant Suspends Dividend Until 2022.

(RTTNews) - Shares of Telefonica SA (TDE.L, TEF) were losing around 2 percent in the trading in Spain after the telecom major on Thursday reported weak first-quarter profit and withdrew fiscal 2020 guidance due to the current level of uncertainty amid Covid-19 impact. However, for the mid-term, the company backed 2022 guidance of revenue growth. José María Álvarez-Pallete, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer noted that the coronavirus crisis has had a limited impact on its first quarter financial results and that its four key markets have performed well in a unique and challenging environment.Separately, Telefonica announced an agreement with Liberty Global plc (LBTYA, LBTYB and LBTYK) to merge their operating businesses in the U.K. to form a 50:50 joint venture.Liberty Global's Virgin Media will be combined with Telefonica's O2 to create a nationwide integrated communications provider with over 46 million video, broadband and mobile subscribers and 11 billion pounds of revenue. The transaction is expected to close around the middle of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals. In the transaction, Telefonica would receive 5.7 billion pounds in total proceeds, while Liberty Global would receive 1.4 billion pounds in total. The JV is expected to deliver substantial synergies valued at 6.2 billion pounds.For the first quarter, Telefonica's net income declined 56.2 percent from last year to 406 million euros. Adjusted net income was 619 million euros, down 30.1 percent.OIBDA amounted to 3.76 billion euros, down 11.8 percent on a reported basis and down 1.7 percent in organic terms.Meanwhile, OIBDA of the four core markets increased 0.8 percent organically from the prior year.OIBDA margin was 33.1 percent, down 2.5 percentage points from last year.Revenues were 11.37 billion euros, a decline of 5.1 percent on a reported basis and down 1.3 percent organically mainly due to lower service revenues while handset sales remained broadly stable. Revenues of the four core markets increased 0.1 percent organically.Further, the company confirmed the announced 0.40 euro dividend for 2020.In Spain, Telefonica shares were trading at 4.18 euros, down 2.36 percent.

Thank you, operator, and hello, everyone. I appreciate you joining us on the call today. And clearly, we have a lot to talk about, so I'm not going to waste much time with formalities. I'm going to jump right into what will be the most important topic, which is how we're managing through the COVID-19 pandemic.First of all, our hearts and prayers go out to everyone, who suffered through this crisis. These are clearly unprecedented times and I am particularly proud of our 27,000 employees across eight countries, who have dedicated themselves to keeping their customers connected, entertained and informed.You can imagine, our primary focus has been on their safety and well being, and while the policies and requirements vary by country, nearly 90% of our team has been working from home and we are deep in preparation for their return to the office and the field on a gradual basis.And we appreciate that this is an extraordinary time for our customers as well. So in addition to providing them with the same reliable and robust connectivity services we're known for, we've been improving their experience in a multitude of ways. We're boosting speed and increasing data caps. We're offering additional entertainment services, especially for kids and we're aware that our customers are experiencing economic challenges as well.So very careful to keep folks connected and help them manage through the crisis, even offering lifeline services where it's necessary. And we're paying special attention to our B2B customers, increasing capacity and providing emergency mobile coverage to hospitals and ensuring quick turnaround on product changes.As an essential service, we have crews and trucks in the field every day, in maintaining our networks, installing new customers and building plans. Our Lightning Construction crews for example are working as we speak. Of course, with additional precautionary measures, but we're on pace to light up at least 350,000 new homes this year. By the way, we've included a slide on Project Lightning in the appendix to see we'd have those details for the quarter.Now, at the outset of the crisis, many wondered whether any network could withstand the increase in usage that would inevitably occur under these circumstances and the answer for us is a clear yes.Our fixed broadband network has seamlessly absorbed 20%-plus increases in the downstream and 50%-plus increases in the upstream bandwidth with no problem at all. So, recent investments in infrastructure and speeds and connectivity products have really proved invaluable for all of us.From a trading point of view, our sales have been largely stable, but down from pre-crisis levels. And at the same time, as many of our peers have reported, we've seen a considerable drop off in churn.We're also experiencing softness in some of our premium sports products. That's not surprising. But in markets like the UK and Ireland these are zero-margin packages for us. And we don't make much money and neither impacting cash flow.On the mobile front, store closures are impacting handset sales and usage has dropped off a bit, as folks offload to Wi-Fi. But in many markets we're on our way to reopening and recovering. For example, two-thirds of the shops in Holland are now open and back in business, and for us, it's just a matter of time we believe.And Charlie is going to address, what all this means to our financial guidance for the year. On one hand, we're fortunate that we have very little exposure to things like advertising or other sectors that are experiencing disruption right now. As a group, our services have proven to be even more vital for consumers during this crisis. On the other hand, we're realistic about the impact this may have on bad debt and potential price increases and mobile roaming revenue, overall customer activity.Like our peers, we're assessing the medium-term impact of the pandemic on our business. And we expect to have a more thorough update for you in the second quarter . There were a lots of uncertainties on the road ahead from lifting of lockdowns to testing a vaccine, but we feel well-positioned to power through this.In the meantime, we are not suspending or changing guidance. We're actually pretty encouraged by our operating and financial prospects for the balance of the year.Let me reset the agenda here a bit, just for a minute and hit a couple of additional highlights on Slide 5. By the way, we're talking from slide. If you can get a hold of those it'd be very helpful for you.Now, despite the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, we delivered a solid first quarter operationally and financially. In fact, the quarter was largely in line or ahead of our internal expectations. I'll talk about this more when we dig into Virgin Media results. But we remain focused on a handful of key performance drivers in our European markets, in particular customer growth, customer ARPU and Fixed-Mobile Convergence.And we did well on all three of these with largely stable customers versus the prior quarter, solid ARPU growth versus the prior quarter and year-over-year, and good mobile additions. And have pointed that these operating strategies are working, right? We have over 32 million gigabit-ready homes across our European footprint, with 1-gig services launched in nearly 12 million of those homes.We're widening the distance between us and our competitors, when it comes to broadband speeds. We had a 22,000 broadband service in the quarter as a result. And our Fixed-Mobile Convergence bundles drove nearly 115,000 postpaid mobile addition.Now finally, a quick update on capital allocation. At the end of February, we authorized a $1 billion share buyback and through the end of April, so in about two months, we've repurchased $500 million of stock at an average price of mid-$16 range. So we're generally buying through 10b5-1 plans according to preset grids or pace accelerated as the stock declined, shouldn't be a surprise to most of you.Now, let me move to the most important announcement today, that is, of course, our agreement with Telefonica to combine our UK operations, Virgin Media and O2. We are really, really excited about this transaction and the partnership with Telefonica. Over the last several years, we've been successfully executing a very clear plan to create national Fixed Mobile Convergence champions in all of our markets.Now, in some cases, we've sold our broadband operations to mobile operators like Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone. We share that exact same belief in convergence by the way. And we've closed those transactions at premium multiples, highlighting the big disconnect between public and private valuations.In markets like Belgium, we acquired MVNO, and are thriving with Fixed Mobile Convergence in that country. And in Holland we joined forces with Vodafone in a 50/50 joint venture to create what is now the fastest growing and most important mobile broadband and entertainment provider in the market.This deal follows that path. By combining O2, the largest and most reliable and admired mobile operator, together with Virgin Media, the country's fastest broadband network and most complete and innovative video platform is a powerhouse combination.First, it gives us the scale to invest competently in gigabit broadband and 5G right when it matters most. That's now. And second, with the best network infrastructure, market-leading positions and world-class brands, we'll have the strength to compete aggressively for customers.And third, of course, the combination delivers significant synergies that will accelerate operating cash flow and free cash flow. Now, we know the playbook well, as we've executed on it many times. It's also a strong statement by both Liberty and Telefonica that we believe in the UK, and are right behind the government's desire to bring next generation connectivity to consumers and businesses as fast as possible.So let's dig in a bit on the transaction itself on Slide 6. There's plenty of detail here, so I'll try to hit the key points. The main deal points are in the left hand side of the slide. This will be a 50/50 JV in all respects. Obviously, we have experience with this structure in Holland and we know can work well.It feels like a very good fit with Telefonica. We have similar values, comparable operating goals and strong leadership on the ground. The economics of the deal are derived from relative valuations at the formation of the JV. You've all seen this equation before.In this case, we value Virgin at a total enterprise value of GBP18.7 billion, resulting in an equity value of GBP7.4 billion, that's assuming, of course, GBP11.3 billion of debt is transferred into the JV. O2 was valued at GBP12.7 billion and will be transferred in debt-free, but with some working capital and debt-like items. So to equalize the ownership, Telefonica need to receive a payment from us of about GBP2.5 billion and that's based on 12 to 131 numbers. That's just math.And the math could change as debt and debt-like items evolve between now and closing, but we expect it to be largely the same, perhaps maybe even -- the payment could be a bit lower. Just the O2 business is largely unlevered. We do intend to recapitalize the JV with about GBP18 billion of total debt, which means each partner will receive recap proceeds on or before closing of approximately GBP3 billion that covers more than our portion of the equalization payment. And that to recap in Virgin Media, Ireland, which will stay outside of the JV, we should end up with net cash proceeds of about GBP1.4 billion or $1.75 billion.It's worth pointing out that this is also a delevering event for our business, which will go from 5.5 times to 5 times leverage in UK. Transactions is obviously subject to regulatory approval, which we anticipate will be reviewed at CMA and should be closed hopefully by the middle of next year, if not sooner.And moving to the right hand side of the chart. The rationale for this combination from our perspective is very compelling. I've covered some of those points already. We're creating a clear convergence champion in our largest market and one of Europe's most attractive. But the transaction also creates real value for shareholders. We've argued for quite some time that our stock doesn't reflect any equity value for Virgin Media. Clearly, this deal changes that debate. And with an implied multiple of 9.3 times in 2019 OCF were 25 times 2019 operating free cash, flow and there is substantial equity value in our UK business, even before net cash proceeds or synergies.Now, as you've read, the synergies are currently valued at an NPV of GBP6.2 billion as reflecting run rate benefits of around GBP540 million per year. It's worth pointing out that, that compares really favorably the other fixed mobile convergence deals we've been associated with it. In fact, it's on the lower end as a percent of the combined costs. Of course, we have a very strong track record of executing and over delivering on synergies, so hopefully that number should be good.On the bottom right, we present some financial metrics you can see that the two businesses together generated GBP11 billion in revenue in 2019 and GBP3.7 billion of OCF or EBITDA. That's before intercompany service charges in the JV structure.And like our Dutch operation, we expected JV to generate significant distributable free cash flow, and then we should benefit from recap and through the dividends down the road. This is, of course, one of many, but a significant driver of the deal for us.Now, Slide 7, just provide some additional background on the combined group. I've already referenced the JVs best-in-class fixed broadband mobile infrastructure. I think the key point here is that this deal will undoubtedly enhanced our confidence and strategic positioning when it comes to expanding our network leadership in the market. O2 has already rolled out 5G to 30 communities, and Virgin has already rolled out gigabit speeds, 2 million homes with the rest of our footprint ready to roll.We know that when the power of 5G meet 1-gig broadband, there is no looking back. And both we and Telefonica see eye-to-eye on the infrastructure network opportunity here. On a whole host of levels, O2 is an ideal partner for Virgin Media. They're extremely well placed in the mobile market with the lowest back book, front book exposure, the lowest market churn, and very high NPS. We've done some of our own research, which confirmed what we knew that both brands have strong customer appeal. What we didn't realize was that the appeal grows even stronger, when the brands are considered together. And that's a great starting point of fixed mobile convergence, as are these other data points, 8 out of 10 Virgin customers use someone else's mobile service today, which provides a huge pool for cross selling O2 to mobile service.Even more compelling research show that 50% of O2 customers that don't have Virgin broadband, are more interested in adopting a converged product, an O2 or Virgin than they would be from another broadband provider. So the fundamentals are here, are very prosperous partnership and we're excited to get started. And after big transaction like this always good to step back and reflect on the composition of our business and assets. And the value creation strategy we're focused on.You'll see that on Slide 8, which shows our major operating businesses laid out along with other assets. And I'll provide just a few quick observations here. Number 1, we have significant scale across Europe. These operations together will serve 80 million fixed and mobile subs, and what we believe are the best European markets. Together, they represent over GBP24 billion in revenue that's taking the JV revenue plus our consolidated revenue, and over GBP8 billion of operating cash flow calculated on this new basis with significant levered free cash flow generation.The second big takeaway is that our three largest assets are or will be less than 100% owned. As much as anything that's a function of European market today, which is rapidly consolidating to drive scale and generate the synergies. Sometimes you need partners and we're certainly willing to join forces to create that value. Sometimes it's public shareholders partnering with. Sometimes it's a strategic operator. So long as there's scope for liquidity and transparency on value we're satisfied.The third point is that the value creation strategy is largely the same across the footprint. We're building national FMC champions, partially because many incumbents are vulnerable underinvested or late to the game, but also because governments and regulators want scale driven challengers. They know that consumers and businesses win when there's infrastructure-based competition. And that's been our mantra for decades, and it's just true today as it ever was.Going forward, the focus is on free cash flow. It has always been one of the most -- if not the most important metrics of our business. Now with revenue and OCF growth flattening in a more mature telecom landscape, it becomes even more important. And it's particularly coveted among European investors just look at where Telenet trade today, for example. So not surprisingly, we will examine the potential for public market listings where and when that may makes sense.At the group level, we continue to have significant liquidity in excess of $10 billion, even before this transaction closes. And of course, none of us predicted this crisis. But what we certainly feel now is fortunate to have the capital to both pursue these types of deals and fundamental FMC strategies in core markets tend to be opportunistic, which we will be. That includes our time honored strategy of driving a levered equity capital structure and, of course, share buybacks as and when appropriate.I'm using this chart as a reference, but there are many ways to look at the valuation of our group. We're not trying to be prescriptive here. But more than a few investors have asked us to put forward a simple sum of the parts analysis that shows the value gap we talked about. This is always a debate with the lawyers and the IR folks, but we've tried to provide a reasonably complete and hopefully simple version of that on Slide 9. I'll try to break this down, and of course, we're happy to take questions.The first two building blocks of value are our cash balance at Q1 and the value of our publically traded shares in Telenet. Together, those numbers add up to about $16 per share. Again, that's just an objective number. We don't assign a specific value to our interest in Holland and Switzerland on this page. But we do provide the necessary metrics for others to do that pretty easily. You can choose your methodology. There are plenty of comparables to measure against.But we think if you can get the $5 to $7 per share pretty easily for our interest in these two markets, that's supported by a 14 multiple on OFCF at the low end and 10% free cash flow yield on the high end. And if you were to use Telenet's multiple OCF, you get somewhere in the middle. So again, many will find their own numbers here. What are -- the point, though, is that our current trading levels, around $21 plus my analysts have pointed out that you could arrive at that price. On these three numbers alone cash plus Telenet stock plus our interest in Holland and Switzerland. In other words, the UK was and perhaps still it being assigned zero equity value in our share price.The left hand side of this chart, we addressed that point, and showing with just one way to look at the implied value of the transaction that we just announced. There are three simple elements here: number 1 is the expected net proceeds of $1.75 billion, which equates to roughly $3 per share; then you have our 50% of the estimated synergies, which adds up to about $6 per share; and finally, there is an implied transaction value for the underlying Virgin Media business when we combine. And we had O2 agreed, as I just mentioned, GBP18.7 billion, which after debt represents an implied value for the equity today of around $14 per share of Liberty Global.If you add all that up, you get to about $23 per share. And that's just on the UK business. And we understand that everyone will have a different view, a different valuation approach. And in particular, some might argue that the implied value of Virgin in the deal and then the combination is a challenging one or not acceptable. We don't agree with that, of course. But if you want to haircut the deal multiple by 20%, and put it us in the mid-7s. You still get the $16 per share with the entire transaction. It's hard to argue that we don't have a considerable value gap here. And I think, you're all capable of doing the math on your own.And we just wanted to give you those components and hopefully clarify what we've been talking about for some time. And one more slide here in Virgin Media to help round out the operating update, and then pass it to Charlie.And as you'll say, there are more operating update slides like this in the back for other assets. But you see that we're trying to focus here on the data that we believe is most important for tracking progress in our core market, namely, winning and retaining customers across our fixed mobile B2B business; secondly, growing ARPU, the up-sell and cross-sell; and third, driving fixed mobile convergence.We're also focused, of course, on extending our network reach and speed leadership, and driving cost efficiencies. In fact, on the cost efficiency side, we've been forced to accelerate some of the transformation in our care and sales capabilities, to be more digital to operate more efficiently and that's going to pay dividends on the other side. And there are a few good visuals in the middle two columns here. You'll see firstly, that Virgin Media's customer base has been largely stable just under 6 million.In fact, the number is only moved about 20,000 customers in five quarters. Yes, as we show the customer gains we pick up in lightning or often offset by the customer losses in the BAU footprint, but the numbers are not significant in either direction. You can also see a strong customer ARPU trend in the last five quarters, with 1.2% growth year-over-year in the first quarter. And this has driven larger than price increases and against cross-sell and up-sell, but also underpinned by product innovation, and improved base management.We are continually seeking to enhance the value for money proposition for customers in this market with things like our next gen V6 set-top box and broadband speed. In fact, in the past quarter we boosted over 1 million customers to 100 megabit broadband speeds bringing our average speed across our base, average speed to 140 megabit. Just by reference for reference purposes. The rest of the UK market is averaging consumer speeds of 30 megabits a second. So we are -- our average Virgin customer is getting broadband speeds 4 to 5 times faster than the rest of the market.As we pointed out, often 95% of that UK network is already won't get ready. And we've launched those speeds across major towns in the 30% of the footprint. I put us on track for networkwide coverage of 1 gig in 2021 delivering 50% of the government's national gigabit ambition four years early. I think there's an offset there. Now Lutz and the team have also been -- already focusing on cross selling to mobile -- mobile into the fixed base following the launch of convergence bundles about a year ago.And the Q1 postpaid net ads were good at 72,000. So fixed mobile convergence is already working at Virgin, we're at 22%. Fixed mobile convergence ratio with plenty of runway. Remember, Telenet, VodafoneZiggo are in the mid-40. So, as we all know, fixed mobile convergence drives higher NPS and lower churn as the fundamental rationale for the deal we announced today. So it all knows and good start to the year for Virgin Media even in light of the pandemic. OFCF margins are strong at 23% before lightning and 17% after, our SOHO customer base grow 7%.And the team is managing through the headwinds we identified at the beginning of the year, the increase in network taxes and the contract notification programming costs, we've been managing through those very, very well. In fact, NPS is up, there's no return is down. I think the group is really well positioned to come out of this COVID period very, very strong. So and that's for me.I'll pass it over to Charlie, and then we look forward to getting your questions. Charlie? -- Thanks, Mike. And now I'm on Page 12, divisional overview, Mike has given you the key operational highlights of Virgin Media. And in the appendix, we've included similar pages, showing the key operational drivers for our other major fixed mobile convergence businesses. In the interest of time, we're not going to review these pages in our remarks today, but please do contact the IR team if you want to discuss them further.On this page, we set out the key financial metrics, which we were using to assess the performance of these national FMC champions. Our focus continues to be to drive OFCF or OCF minus accrued capex, and free cash flow as these markets mature in terms of broadband penetration.Now for reference, we've also included a page in the appendix setting out our view of 2019 free cash flow for each of our divisions after the allocation of interest and the central technology and innovation capex. But for the quarter on this slide, I will focus on the underlying OFCF trends year-on-year, revenue in the UK anonymous slightly down 0.6%, but OCF declined 3.5%, OFCF before Lightning Construction capex increased $18 million to $372 million for the quarter.We increased our investments in Lightning compared to 2019 Q1 and spent $99 million, with 93,000 homes released during the quarter. Revenue growth in Belgium was slightly down at 0.4%, OCF up 0.6% and year-on-year OFCF down $10 million to $187 million. As John already explained in the Telenet earnings call, there was an acceleration of prepaid sports rights costs, and some front loading capex in Q1, which contributed to this year-on-year OFCF decline.But for the full year, confirmed that, excluding the effects of the lockdowns in the second half of the year, they expect to deliver full year rebased OFCF growth of 1% to 2% on an IFRS basis and adjusted free cash flow the lower end of the previous GBP415 million to GBP430 million guidance range. This assumes that they will gradually exit the lockdown starting in May, with a gradual economic recovery thereafter.In Switzerland, UPC was caught up in the continuing price competition in that market, which resulted in an accelerated decline in consumer and SOHO customer ARPU. This contributed to 2.7% decline in revenue. They also had an acceleration in prepaid sports rights cost in the quarter, as well as accelerated spending capex contributing to a lower OFCF of $55 million. However, based on current expectations around the impact of COVID. We expect cash generation to improve and the company remains on track to produce around $170 million of free cash flow for the full year, which includes central opex and capex allocations.In Holland, VodafoneZiggo had a very strong quarter with revenue growth of 3.3%, OCF growth of 4.9% and OFCF of $258 million, as they outperformed our expectations in virtually every operating metric, showing the strength of these converged national FMC champions.They're now expecting stable to modest rebased OCF growth for full year. And have maintained their original free cash flow guidance of GDP400 million to GDP500 million and potential cash for shareholders distributions. Now, again, this assumes no further deteriorations as a result of COVID.On the page entitled Group Overview, we set out the key financial metrics for the group as a whole. Revenue declined 0.3% for the quarter, an improvement over the declines from the previous four quarters, despite the impact of COVID-19. OCF growth also improved compared to the last three quarters of 2019, a minus 3.6% in line with our pre-covered expectations.OFCF continue to improve and excluding Lightning Construction capex was $593 million for the quarter, up from $569 million a year ago. The continuing reduction in capex intensity contributed this. And capex as a percentage of sales prior to Lightning Construction capex at 19.4%, lower than the previous four quarters.Liquidity remains extremely strong. Cash, including our $2 billion investments in separately managed accounts was $7.4 billion. Now, as many of you know, our SMAs are invested in low-risk liquid investments. Both our SMAs and money market accounts are now largely invested in government securities, as opposed to AAA funds, which will lead to a reduction in interest income going forward, but ensure maximum security for the cash.For the available revolving credit facilities in our operating companies, the group as a whole has $10.3 billion of liquidity. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 5.2 times growth and 3.7 times net EBITDA. The cost of debt continues to decline as we continued our refinancing program during Q1 and now stands at 4.1% with an average life in excess of seven years.On the page titled adjusted free cash flow, we lay out the key components of free cash flow. Q1 OFCF before Lightning Construction capex was $595 million, and our net interest for the quarter was $579 million. We make virtually all our interest payments in Q1 and Q3. So this phasing is in line with our expectations.Cash tax was positive for the quarter of $5 million. And we expect the full year 2020 figure to be lower than the full year 2019 figure of $358 million, partly due to reduced U.S. tax payments. The distributions in the JV in Holland were $11 million for the quarter, but we continue to expect full-year distributions of GBP200 million to GBP250 million, in line with VodafoneZiggo's recent guidance.And as is typically the case in Q1, working capital was negative at $250 million, largely due to the phasing of vendor financing program. And as in 2019, we continue to target broadly flat net working capital flows to the year.Adjusted free cash flow before Lightning Construction capex was negative $218 million for the quarter and negative $317 million after construction capex, which again was in line with our expectations.Turning to the outlook for the full year, we're still assessing the medium-term impact from COVID-19. And we'll give investors a further update in Q2. Despite the impact of COVID, we continue to be encouraged by our operating prospects. And unless there's another step change in the macroeconomic environment, we don't see a need to change or suspend our original full-year guidance as detailed on the slide.And note that our current assumption is that lockdowns are lifted from Q2 followed by a gradual economic recovery. And also that our original $1 billion free cash flow guidance was based on exchange rates of EUR1.13 to $1, and $1.33, GBP1. Although we don't guide on rebased revenue growth, we do expect negative impacts to revenue from reduced handset sales, and premium video, particularly sports.But both of these are relatively low-margin and have a limited impact on cash flow. We will continue to monitor the impact of the crisis on these forecasts and update you further in Q2. And so with that, I'll turn it back to the operator. And in order to address everyone's questions, we would kindly ask if you would keep to one question each.The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first caller. -- Yeah, hi. -- Who it is? -- Robert Grindle, it's Robert from Deutsche Bank. Hi, there. -- Hey, Robert. -- Yeah. So one question, so I'd like to ask about the JV structure and why you chose that rather than, say, a majority stake. Is this the only game in town? Or was it as you mentioned about confirming a positive equity value for VMED? Was the JV structure also interesting, given your thinking about an extended fiber builds program? Obviously, chest got a lot of fiber experience. Is that something you are aligned on? Thank you. -- Okay, that's three questions. Let me see if I can jump into those. There's always multiple ways to approach a transaction like this or a strategic move like this. But this felt to us like the best outcome and the best partner for all kinds of reasons. And I've talked about those in the remarks I just made, so you've heard that.And we're comfortable, as I mentioned, with these structures. We have experience with them. It's worked exceedingly well in Holland with Vodafone, who's been a great partner. And so, this was the transaction that was presented to us or that we also went out and sought, and the one we think will be most accretive and most advantageous.So, sure, there's always a different ways to do it. It had nothing to do with what you're describing. And then the value, the value once you decide how you're going to approach a partnership, then you agree on values, not the other way around. I don't think it was driven by value. It wasn't driven by anything other than that. It wasn't obviously the only game in town.There are multiple mobile operators in this market without fixed infrastructure. So clearly, there were other options. But again, as I said, we felt this was the best option. And credit to Telefonica for also being quite interested and focused on this. And I think it is the best fit. It doesn't change anything with respect to our -- the level of excitement we have around Project Lightning or network extension in the market. It takes nothing off the table.In fact, I would argue and I think Telefonica would agree, this increases our confidence level, in looking at a national scope, or extending convergence, best-in-class network. How you achieve that? How we finance that? And how aggressive we are, that is all to be determined. But I think the main takeaway is it doesn't change our level of excitement. It takes nothing off the table. I would say it only enhances our ability to be strategic and financially aggressive, and it makes sense, in terms of looking at our network and the opportunities that we've discussed historically. -- Okay. And thanks.We'll go next to Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. -- Good morning. How are we -- hi, how reasonable of comp is your operating strategy, synergy upside, I mean, I think obviously leverage levels at VodafoneZiggo, that JV, so what you sort of expect from this deal? And then, if I could sneak one in about the back-book repricing in UK, and how that's going relative to your expectations? Thanks. -- Okay. Lutz, you can prepare for the back-book repricing issue. The Punch-line is, are in line. But there are lots of things that are similar in this transaction to the VodafoneZiggo transaction. Obviously, the structure itself, there are often many -- big differences too, of course, in terms of the size of the market and the competitive landscape that we find ourselves in.On the other hand, it is a similar playbook for us. And it's one we're quite familiar with. So our approach to synergies, our approach to integration, our approach to strategy to drive revenue and convergence are quite similar. And it wouldn't surprise us if down the road these two companies together are achieving similar outcomes.It's possible here we might even exceed the convergence levels that we see today. In Holland, which are mid-40s. It could be even higher in this market. A lot of it has to do with what -- how the market evolves generally and how competitors react over time. I don't believe there'll be any reaction that's worthy of discussion in the short term or even in immediate term perhaps. But how the market evolves over the longer term is what's critical.I'd simply say, when we put the business plan together, at least from our perspective, we were very conservative about the stand-alone mobile business and the challenges that it might face. And we think we were very appropriately conservative about our own business, just to be, thoughtful and not too ambitious.And I think when you put those two businesses together as you drive synergies through that that business plan. It is very accretive and quite attractive, and that obviously drove the transaction. So I think with very conservative assumptions on either business, with the synergies, which I think, as you point out, are probably conservative.Certainly, it's one of the lowest, if not, the lowest percentage we've seen in eight countries or seven countries we've been involved in FMC transactions now. But there's good reason for that. This transaction came together relatively quickly. We wanted to be thoughtful and not over promise. We've never missed a synergy budget. You would know that, Jeff, or synergy target, in fact I think almost in every case. We've exceeded our synergy budget and targets. So this should be the same. -- On end of contract verification, so we have it out in the market since February, the 10th. The churn level is exactly what we have planned for. How many customers are calling in and how many customers decide to leave us. And then, the second lever is how much discount do you offer to keep the customer connected.And the discount we have offered so far, it's only one-third of what we have planned for. So therefore, it is altogether slightly better than we have expected. But the caveat to that is that we are only six weeks into it in that quarter, and also that was precluded. And that might change, so therefore we stayed cautious. But I have to say, although the market was pretty competitive in March and in February, we are doing slightly better than expected. -- Thank you.We'll go next to David Wright with Bank of America. -- Thank you, guys, for taking the call. And, Mike, if I could maybe express some gratitude, I guess, more generally for the salary sacrifices etc in light of COVID. My question is just on the UK joint venture and spectrum costs. There is a UK spectrum auction forecast, which probably should be this year, could be next year. Should we expect in the event of any delays that, that is cost that Telefonica will bear, or is there a risk that that could drop into the JV? Thank you. -- Thanks very much, David. I believe the press release referenced this, but you might not have a chance to review, get through it or seen it. But the basic deal is that Telefonica will bring to the JV the spectrum that we both believe is necessary to achieve the plan at their cost. So that was the arrangement that we reached early on. And that so they'll deliver to the JV at their cost the spectrum when that auction occurs.Obviously, we have not been able to discuss spectrum with them in any detail. It's a very complicated and has to be quite careful. So we don't know what they're doing. We don't have any real understanding of what they may do. But whatever they end up with it'll be at their cost. -- Mike, just maybe extending on your comment on Lightning, and you've been very vocal with perceived on the valuation of Lightning, you stripped it out, etc. It's kind of dropping in at 10 times EBITDA into this deal. How did you kind of think about valuing Lightning independently as the kind of steady-state VMED cable infrastructure? -- Yeah, good question. Look, I think we each had some assets on the -- on each side of the deal that we could have argued for different values. But they have their tower interests in UK, which they thought at one point maybe it would be better outside of JV we had the Lightning transaction. But we both agreed that this is going to be a long-term partnership, that we should be doing things inside the partnership that makes perfect strategic sense and operational sense and financial sense.So let's just say that, the valuation was considered, but we didn't get into that kind of granularity, when it came to -- this is always negotiation, in terms of identifying exactly what Lightning reference includes or doesn't include. Then we didn't do this, we did -- probably approached it similarly on their tower footprint. -- Very useful. Thank you.We'll go next to Michael Bishop with Goldman Sachs. -- Yes. Thanks. Just both two very quick questions. Firstly, you're now effectively sitting on a large cash balance, and given this deal, I guess isn't consuming any of your cash. I'd just love to hear your latest thoughts on how you think about managing that cash balance effectively with this transaction, not consuming cash?And then super quickly, could I just follow-up on the last question? Clearly, you've been clear that Lightning is going into the JV. But I'm just going to ask as a follow-up on the other fiber company that you've set up, just I noticed that the $10 billion of capex over the next five years commitment doesn't really implicitly assume at least on my numbers that necessarily announcing anything with regards to the 7 million extra homes you've identified and also the fiber joint venture and those discussions. So any update there would be great. Thanks. -- Sure. On the second point, yes, anything we pursue or anything they pursue that would normally be considered a JV activity, is likely going to be a JV activity. So Liberty fibers, as you described, it is certainly something we would pursue through the joint venture. And I think, as Jose Maria said on his call, these are the issues that we'll address together in terms of pace, and speed, and financing structure and opportunity.In the meantime, we'll continue with Lightning. In fact, we think we might exceed our budget on Lightning. We can, of course, choose to spend more or less between now and closing. It just works out in working capital. But I think for the most part, you should assume that the JV will jointly address these strategic opportunities. And capital will come from both parties as a result of that.On the cash balance, I think we'll remain disciplined as we have remained discipline. As I said, nobody anticipated this environment. We always said you never know what the future is going to bring. And this was not something any of us hoped for. And on the other hand, we're thankful to be liquid and we're thankful to have cash. And we'll remain disciplined on how we deploy the cash.As I said, and have said, the first order of business is our core markets, and where we know and we already operate, that will remain the case. Secondly, we'll look within the region we operate in, would be look for opportunities for consolidation or other similar convergence strategies, I would say. We have as we've talked many times, it's Ventures portfolio, not big, maybe $1 billion of interest in existing assets that we own in tech and content.And, so we'll be careful and thoughtful about opportunities to build new revenue streams, new investment portfolios and new business opportunities. But I think we'll do that carefully and with great transparency, and probably wouldn't require the kind of capital that we have. So this is a good problem to have. It's a good question to be focused on for us. But it's not something we can give you any more clarity on that as we sit here today, Michael, but stay tuned. -- Thanks a lot. -- Now, of course, I didn't mention in that what we have used historically our excess capital for and that is these buybacks. I did mention in my remarks is that -- it's always on the list for our levered equity growth strategy. As we start to drive free cash flow and free cash flow per share, clearly, that's an accelerator of free cash flow per share. But, again, we're not being -- on this call, we're not going to be -- I couldn't give you any details about that. Obviously, we'll let you know.By the way, I know we've probably got a lot of questions. So just for everybody's benefit, our remarks went a bit longer, we're going to keep the line open. I'm sure you've got plenty of calls to get on to. And but I think we'll probably try to keep the line open for 10 to 15 minutes to be sure we get to a few more questions, since we were a bit longer in our remark today. So go ahead, operator.Yes, we'll go next to Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. -- Thanks. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Mike. -- Hi, Ben. -- I wanted to -- assuming you are somewhere where -- it's morning, OK, it may not be the case, but wanted to ask about tax implications of all this. I think you guys announced you're moving effectively all the UK tax allowances etc into the JV. You guys, I think originally reincorporated over in the UK at least partly for the tax benefits, and just wondering how that -- what the tax structure and tax leakage if anything of the JV will look like? I'm assuming that will be not much anytime soon and then implications if any for the consolidated operations, Switzerland, Benelux, etc, in terms of cash taxes as a result of this deal. -- Okay. There's no implications to other assets. The UK tax losses have always been largely ring fenced within the UK and only usable on a UK entity. So it's no implications at all for the other operations. I'll simply say on a tax structure won't be surprising to you, I think, it's quite efficient. We don't -- without getting into great detail, there shouldn't be any tax implications on formation of the joint venture. The losses that exist will be transferred and, to the best of our ability used by the JV. There are some -- as ever some nuances there. But for the most part, it's a very tax efficient transaction really for both parties and certainly for us, and we're not -- we don't see any leakage of the kind you described. -- Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on Virgin, maybe for Lutz, if he's on. What's the pricing environment look like at this point, obviously, you've got a lot of stress in the economy. Just wondering from a competition point of view of things has continued to be as tough as they've been, or if we've seen -- if you've seen any of your -- of the operators you compete with get a little more rational, so to speak, given just the focus on the macro and pressures on things like liquidity, etc? -- Lutz, go ahead. -- So -- yeah, so I think in February and March and maybe because of the start of end-of-contract notification. I would say that the market was even a bit more competitive. So when you compare the deepness of discount to a year ago, discounts were 5% to 10% deeper. And then now after COVID, obviously, right sales are down, and in fact, not so much. So we are still operating on 80% sales level, and churn went down dramatically. But in this environment, obviously, you're less aggressive in terms of promotion. And so I would say it was a bit more aggressive and we kept our strategy right. So you see that we kept our customers flat, we are looking to create a really customer relationship with high value customers. We were not looking for the low end in the broadband. We were not looking for the low end in the video. And so therefore the service revenue out of that was 0.8% and the ARPU grew to 1.2%. And this is exactly on our strategy. -- Thank you.We'll go next to Vijay Jayant with Evercore. -- Hi, Mike. I just wanted to understand, obviously, the structure now that most of your values are in JVs in the UK and Holland pro forma for this transaction. And about $1 billion of EBITDA on the remaining consolidated assets. How -- in terms of transparency and value recognition, obviously, you will make a case for that in today's presentation. How are we going to sort of track the performance of the JVs? And are you -- regarding the risk of getting sort of a discount, because most values are an equity stakes. And have you thought about, tracking stock or any structures that can show the value of those assets that you don't sort of see on a consolidated basis? -- Yeah, good question. We did try to address it a bit in the remarks, but it's worth repeating, that this does change, it takes our largest consolidated business and puts it into a JV. And so that does obviously have accounting and consolidation implications. However, because it's our largest business, we will report quite extensively on the business. And so, I don't see any reduction in transparency around the core operating companies. So firstly, I would say you get, you should be able to see through the structures and we will endeavor to report on the businesses in much the same way with arguably as much in more detail.So I think, we'll be focused on transparency for investors on the actual operating businesses, how they're performing, and we're quite engaged, of course, in all of these, and how they do. So that's point 1.Point 2, Virgin wasn't a public company when it was 100% owned. Virgin, O2, whatever name it maybe, is -- won't be a public company, when we started JV. But down the roads, there could be opportunities in that said to create public listings are or structures that, that identify and isolate value and I think show value more, more creatively and more effectively. Nothing's off the table, I mean, and we retained -- as we would expect, we did retain the ability to perhaps create trackers or things of that nature.So in the Liberty tradition, all options are available to us to ensure we're getting transparent value. But we'll be thoughtful about that over time. It is the right point, which is why we spend a few more minutes than we normally would on structure and value creation. And holding company discounts, that's your expertise. I don't think so, I would argue for it, obviously. But we certainly can't -- at this point in time, we would take a holding company discount if somebody valued the stock correctly. So I think it's all relative, and we'll have to see how we go. -- Thank you. -- You bet.We'll go next to Polo Tang with UBS. -- Yeah, hi. I just have one question, and that is does the deal with O2 preclude doing a cable wholesale deal, or a fiber JV with Sky? Or is this just not a priority at the moment? Thanks. -- Well, thanks, Polo. As I said at the beginning of the Q&A, nothing's off the table. So I think the direct answer is, no. We don't believe that this transaction either as it's pending or when closed, creates any obstacles to smart opportunity. I'm not going to comment on that one specifically, I'll simply say that it doesn't take anything off the table legally, structurally, we don't believe from a regulatory point of view. So there would be -- all the conversations that we were having and all the ideas that we were discussing, I think remain and can be executed on if they make sense. So that goes for the Lightning build out. That goes for strategic partnerships with other operators if they make sense that goes for all the kind of things that we know can be accretive and strategically valuable for the group. We still believe can be evaluated and considered. -- And I'll just clarify that on the timing for the deal -- can I just clarify the timing of the deal more now than given COVID-19 situation, something changed on your part, in terms of what spurred the move now to that deal? Or was there a change on this point? Can you maybe give some color? -- Yeah, as you would imagine, this didn't come -- I mean, the crisis that we're all facing now and with the pandemic, obviously, is somewhat recent. This is -- these are conversations that go back some time. So, as discussions and negotiations have momentum, you keep the momentum. I would say definitely, that we didn't see anything in the current environment that suggested we shouldn't continue with this opportunity, as opposed to the environment, stimulating the opportunity, it's the other way around. It's an opportunity there was always there. And we didn't do anything that created an obstacle or that should slow it down. So it's really nothing to do with the current environment. It's just the timing is coincidental. -- Thanks. -- Yeah.We'll go next to Nick Lyall with SocGen. -- Good afternoon, Mike, Charlie. And it's just a very quick one, maybe on the Swiss prices, please. They seem pretty -- the ARPU seem pretty weak this quarter. Is that just a COVID impact, maybe with some sports and PayTV items there? Is that something we should expect sort of for the rest of the year, it's in pretty structural pricing pressure points? -- I don't know, if Baptiest is on the call. -- Yes, I'm in. -- Yeah. You want to address that quickly. Baptiest Coopmans is the current CEO of Swiss business. Do you want to address that? -- Yeah. I am in Switzerland since February 1. So the market stays competitive, and we try to find the right balance between volume and value there. And that's the answer, and I think Charlie was very clear. We think we will have a $170 million cash flow out of this business this year. And the underlying trends are all improving. All-time high customer satisfaction now, company is doing very well through COVIDs. So in that sense, the next quarter you will see that. And on top of that we had a major simplification program launch that will kick in the coming quarters. -- Thanks very much.We'll go next to Christian Fangmann with HSBC. -- Yeah. Hi, guys. Quick one. I was not reading anything in the press release? Is there actually a break fee agreed, and then how about the brands? What are you planning to use in terms of -- are we seeing something similar like at VodafoneZiggo? -- No, no disclosure on the brands. This is -- it's too early to have any discussions about that or even any agreements about that. So the brands will be determined down the road, when companies actually do come together and there's a management team and we can have a thoughtful conversation about it, so business as usual for now and no update on brand. I'll simply say, we think both brands are really strong and complimentary. And that's a good thing going into it. No break fee disclosed, and no break fee agreed. -- Okay. That's very clear. Thanks. -- Yeah.We'll go next to Steve Malcolm with Redburn. -- Thanks, guys. Good afternoon and Good morning. I'll go -- give me answer one-to-one, that's fine. Just going back to the contractual situation. Can you just sort of shed me light on any MAC clauses in there? I mean, obviously, you're talking about backward looking leverage and tends to expect UK, yes, down this year. If combined EBITDA were 10%, 20% lower and leverage is in the mid-5.5%. Do you have like surface to go back and look at the overall debt in the JV, when it closes.And maybe just a quick one on the contractual position of your major content providers in the UK, BT and Sky. I take the point that your sports revenues are zero margin, but that doesn't mean that couldn't be negative margin, if you're not collecting revenues, you have to pay for them. So are you able to get relief on those sports right? While you're not filling your customers? Maybe any help on that, that would be helpful, would be great. Thank you. -- Okay. Yeah, these can go to the sports issues, your answer is yes. I think that the agreement or the release, I think, it was clear. The expectation is that we'll have leverage in 4 to 5 times range, which will be closer to the high end of that range. When we close and we expect that to be the case the market, today, it's not necessarily the ideal moment to get all of the financing lined up. Normally, we would announce and conclude all the financing before even signing a transaction. But we felt like to be -- to optimize cost capital in the optimized structure, there's no reason to do it all right now. But the gap of what remains is quite small. I think, Charlie, it's only a couple billion pounds really that isn't yet raised or ready to be transferred over, I think that's the more or less. So at best, the number more or less. So there's not -- the financing condition is not a particularly important on mobile, at this stage.Lutz, you want to address the sports issue? -- Yes. On the spot issue, so we have been following exactly what client and BT has offered their customer. So simply pause the sport contract packages if the customer wants you to, and therefore we are also in a position with those not to pay for those customers just decided to pause their packages with us. And therefore, that is not margin neutral to us. -- Okay. So you are able to -- yeah, BT and Sky have agree for you not to pay the wholesale cost for that period of time. -- Exactly. I mean, we -- obviously, you have to come to an agreement and we are in the middle of that, but that as we understand. We got this 4%. And also when you read our contract, it's pretty much like that. -- Okay. I'm sorry. If I just come back to the first question, and if EBITDA were significantly lower, is that $18 billion of debt? Or would you review it at that point? -- Well, I think the partners can always agreed to review it. Obviously, we reserve that option. But I think I don't believe in Charlie jump in here, right. We don't see any impediments to achieving that level of debt between now and closing, which is one that would likely occur. It's probably on the shorter end of that. Charlie, do you want to go with that? -- And Steve, we've gone through what's called [Technical Issues] his team and Telefonica. So we're pretty comfortable that we have built into the full cost very significant. Actually with that we were attracted you pursue very kind of resilient businesses, [Technical Issues] have done, it. It's still trading on pretty well. So I'm very, very confident. And this get the remaining couple of billion done, remember, the debt we have today are on created assets, we come across the 11 plus million. So it's already [Technical Issues] -- I'm not questioning that you can get the debt. I'm just questioning whether it's the right level of debt as EBITDA was a lot lower? -- Steve, one thing I would say that expenses are very, very [Technical Issues] which is I think as Mike indicated, there might be a little conservative. Like gives a lot more creditworthiness to work as combined than just two standup companies. So we'll see, but I think [Technical Issues] and we have to find out based on what we know today, I think. -- Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.We'll go next to James Ratzer with New Street Research. -- Yes. Thank you very much, everybody. And my continued congrats on the deal. I think the question I had today probably more for Lutz, actually, just on the UK performance, which looked pretty encouraging this quarter. I was just interested in kind of two specific areas. I mean, one, with all the extra home working going on, are you seeing signs that customers are actually upgrading their broadband packages as a result, and how supportive is that to your ARPU trend?And secondly, I mean, to what extent have you been benefiting, we simply from being able to do extra customer installs, as I understand open reach has been more limited in being able to do that. How much of a boost is that providing to the current numbers? Thank you. -- Yeah. So on the home working, I mean, in general 95% of our customers have 100 MB speed or more, right. As Mike said earlier on our average speed is 140 meg. So therefore, our customers do operate already on a very -- our consumer customers to operate on an already on its very high speed. And so therefore, we don't see additional demand on top of that currency and the consumer space. On the B2B space, we see that we have further demand, higher speed packages, working from home packages for some of our customers. So that is encouraging.And in terms of net ads, you're right, I would say, currently we are net benefiter. So what do I mean that our sales are still at 80%. And it's only online, but it's remarkable. It's obviously a more connectivity focus. So less demand on video, more on broadband, fixed broadband. And also our churn is restored now. And I think this is because of two things. One, simply you don't want to change the system, while you're so reliant on it. And second, obviously, in the market, you cannot be assured if it's a manual install, with competition that you get actually installed, why we keep on doing the manual install as well. So therefore, you're right, currently, we are growing a bit our customer base because of that.But as you said also Q1, we kept the customer base platform. So we cannot count our strategy just on the weakness of a competitor. So we can expect from us further initiatives to keep or grow our customer base. -- Great. Thank you.We'll go next to Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark. -- Thank you. I realized that over the top this question is, I think you did the right thing from a derisking and liquidity enhancement advantage point in this environment. But as an extension of the Robert Grindle question. I mean, you and John alone really have the opportunity to kind of be the ultimate, I guess, Angle, Cable Cowboys. If you had turned around and bought all of O2, and equally have the financial wherewithal to do that GBP12.7 billion enterprise value and now get seen GBP6.7 billion in synergies over a 5-year time. And so really wanted to get Machiavelli as this develops over time, he really would have had some opportunities for some very accretive stock buybacks, for obvious reasons. Is that something you ever would have looked at? I mean, you wouldn't have less complexity, I guess, in terms of financial engineering, but probably an inordinate amount of risk in this COVID-19 environment.And I realized that sort of really over the top question, but I thought I'd run it by you, nonetheless. -- Well, Matt, I mean, you would know, we're looking at all options and all alternatives. And generally we land on the one we think is the most accretive and create the most value, and this we believe is the one. So every market is different, every set of opportunities is different. And generally speaking, we're -- we never take anything off the table. We're always looking at what's in front of us. But in this case, we believe this is the right outcome. That's what I'll say. -- Right, I think that's right and congratulations. -- Okay, thanks. Now, we're 10 after here. So, I guess, Rick -- operator, we'll take one or two more and then let people get back to their day, if there are one at the moment.Okay. We'll go next to Ulrich Rathe with Jefferies. -- Yeah. Thanks very much. Mike, highlighted on footprint expansion, your and Telefonica share excitement about expanding that. Could you comment on the capacity to pull that off during a period of probably quite large scale merger integration, at the same time embarking on accelerated footprint expansion potentially? I realize even after unplanned, but how do you look at the title capacity to pull all these things together at the same time? Thank you. -- Yeah. It's a good question. And it will be something that we factor in. We wouldn't ever make strategic decisions that impact our ability to execute synergies or integrate the businesses. On the other hand, we're already out there today, every day, building, extending plan in the Street. So if we were able to do it or see our way clear to doing it, as a stand-alone company, there's nothing about being a larger, more integrated company that should change that materially.But it's the right question. It's a process of making sure you're prioritizing where you spend your time and where you have your resources focused, but as we lay that out on the page, we'll make that determination. But I don't see anything off the top in which you can comment that would somehow preclude us from having the wherewithal or the resources or the will to go ahead and continue looking at a broader network expansion if it makes.And you can always -- there's lots of ways of structuring it and financing it as well. So I think it's the right thing to think about. But on the other hand, there's nothing in my mind, that says, it's not it's not doable. We'll get there when we get there. -- All right, that's helpful. -- I think that to add to that. -- How about timing though, is -- oh, sorry. Go ahead. -- Well, I can get some of flavor to that. I think what we have done now is we have put really all network extension, so from consumer from B2B from wholesale into the Lightning unit. And they are accelerating the network extension. I mean, we have just announced the beginning of the week that we will mobile backhaul 3,000 5G sites from 3G. So therefore, we have secured vendors, for an acceleration in rollout, like we've also close a couple of LFSN deal.So therefore, the machine is growing. And the machine will run also quite independently. So therefore, it's not so much impacted by the complexity of an integration. -- Got it. Thank you, guys. Thank you.And we will take our last question from Sam McHugh from Exane. -- Morning, guys. Morning, guys. Just sticking to fiber in the UK, following BT's announcement today, do you see any kind of strategic need to move a bit faster on your own network expansion be in Project Lightning? I mean, just linked to that, I think by the end of this year, we need to implement gainer-led switching in the UK.I'm not sure if that has any kind of positive implications or negative implications here. If you have any interesting thoughts, that would be great. Thanks very much. -- Well, look, I think, BT will make the decisions that it needs to make in the context of its own financial picture. And I think they will build and we anticipate they will continue to roll out fiber and they should. So I don't know that their announcements or commentary today changes anything really, more or less confirming what they anticipated. And they should be leaning into this element of their business. And I think they'll probably do that.So I don't believe it changes it materially. And, Lutz, do you want to tackle the second question? I'm not sure I fully understood it or got all the details of it, but maybe you did. -- I mean, what we are accelerating is fixed-mobile convergence, right, the more customers we have locked in is fixed or mobile, in the better position, we are to protect them from competition, right. So we are doing more speed for our customers now. More fixed-mobile convergence and network extension at the moment, the pace you know. And we are looking for ways to accelerate that.And with all of that, I think we are operating on our plan. And I agree with Mike, I think we haven't seen anything surprising or any acceleration from BT to a previous announcement. -- Okay. And with that, we will let you get back to your day. Always appreciate you participating in these calls and your support. We're excited about this deal that goes without saying, we are creating an FMC champions -- a champion with incredible synergies, and needs great vote of confidence for us and for Telefonica in the UK. So we're excited to get it going. And I would just lastly say, stay well, stay healthy, stay safe, and we'll speak to you soon.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"On May 1, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:) filed an  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow the future sale of 150.5 million shares of SPCE stock held by certain insiders. 	
		Source: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.com
	On the surface, the idea of insiders such as Richard Branson contemplating sales of SPCE stock seems pretty ominous. While there are many things to consider before investing in Virgin Galactic, the sale of shares by insiders is not one of them. Here’s why. I don’t know about you, but most Americans these days know somebody who is struggling to stay afloat as a result of the . I’m not suggesting that Branson or Chamath Palihapitiya — who together control almost all shares available for sale — are struggling. Still, like most people, they have obligations to meet. Share sales are often the most expedient way to come up with cash in a hurry. One of the selling stockholders is Boeing HorizonX Ventures. It owns 1.9 million shares. (NYSE:) solely owns those shares. I have no idea if it wants to sell, but given that it’s borrowed  in recent weeks to survive the pandemic, it probably wouldn’t look too good holding a vanity investment such as Virgin Galactic. That said, Boeing invested last October as a way to get to the front of the line when it comes to future space travel. From Boeing HorizonX Ventures’ Brian Schettler at the time of its : “Boeing’s strategic investment facilitates our effort to drive the commercialization of space and broaden consumer access to safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible new forms of transportation.”Either way, giving Boeing the option makes sense. The Motley Fool’s Rich Smith recently explained that Virgin Galactic’s stock price  because investors were unimpressed with the revelation that insiders intend to sell as much as 72% of the company’s stock in the future. Yes, it seems like a strange proposition. After all, wasn’t it Branson that  with the grand idea of operating commercial space flights?“I hope, with the launch of Virgin Galactic and the building of our fleet of spacecraft, that one day children around the world will wonder why we ever thought that space travel was a dream we read about in books,” Branson said in 2004. It’s true that Branson is the visionary behind Virgin Galactic. But it’s also true that many of Virgin’s 500 companies are smaller investments using others’ money to grow.In 2012, The Guardian published an article that reminded readers that few of Branson’s diverse array of businesses are . In many ways, he’s the United Kingdom’s version of President Donald Trump. He often licenses the Virgin brand to others, while owning very little of those businesses himself. For example, in 2014,  to Liberty Global (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) for $24 billion. Branson had a small stake in the company and was  to promote Virgin Media’s services. Also, the Virgin group of companies had several promotional arrangements with Virgin Media.  Richard Branson is said to be worth $4.4 billion. He currently is in a battle to , the airline he started in 1984. It is also one of the Virgin Group’s most significant investments. It owns 51% of the airline with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:) owning the rest.If Branson and Virgin Group owned 100% of all 500 companies it’s started, he would likely be one of the world’s wealthiest persons. It wouldn’t have made sense for Virgin Galactic to go public if Branson and the Virgin Group intended to hang on to control of the company. The whole idea was to bring more investors to the table. With an  in 2019 on $3.8 million in revenue, you can be sure that Virgin Galactic’s share count in five years won’t be just 210 million. It will likely be in the billions. So, the “potential” sale of 150 million existing shares in the long run is much ado about nothing.Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Monday, shares of Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.8, after changing hands as low as $17.04 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 26.8.  A bullish investor could look at LBTYA's 28.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of LBTYA shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, LBTYA's low point in its 52 week range is $17.04 per share, with $28.62 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $17.58.

Shares of both   and   traded higher on Friday, after Bloomberg reported these telecommunication companies are planning to merge operations in the United Kingdom. Liberty Global's stock was the bigger winner from the news. Its Class A shares finished up 15% while its Class C shares rose 17%.The response was more tempered for Telefonica, with shares rising 6% during the session. Image source: Getty Images.In the U.K., Liberty Global is the sole owner of Virgin Media, through which it offers phone, TV, and internet services. Virgin Media is reportedly set to merge with Telefonica's O2 Wireless segment. O2 Wireless is one of the largest wireless carriers in the U.K. A merger of these two operations would be a bold move for both companies. Consider that 57% of Liberty Global's 2019 revenue came from the U.K. and Ireland, where it does business under its Virgin Media segment. For Telefonica, the U.K. and O2 Wireless make up a smaller percentage of overall company revenue, but this is an area of sustained growth: It's grown U.K revenue for 14 consecutive quarters.Some are speculating that Telefonica is hoping to off-load O2 wireless, to continue taking care of its heavy debt load. But that would be a surprise move considering that the company just said in its fourth-quarter  that sustainable growth in the U.K. was a top priority.Until Liberty Global and Telefonica validate the merger report, investors should take today's news with a grain of salt. Often the devil is in the details, and right now shareholders don't have enough clarity to understand the financial impact for either . Investors may get that clarity soon. Telefonica is scheduled to report earnings on May 7, with Liberty Global expected to report in May as well.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"pain’s Telefónica said on Monday it is in talks with U.S. tycoon John Malone’s cable group Liberty Global over a possible merger of their U.K. operations, in a deal that would create a new television and mobile company with a combined value of almost £28 billion ($35 billion).The Spanish telecom group (ticker: TEF) said discussions to combine its O2 mobile business with Liberty Global’s (LBTYA) Virgin Media cable network were in “negotiation phase” and it couldn’t guarantee the terms of the deal or the probability of success. People close to the situation said the talks were at an advanced stage and a deal could be announced as early as Thursday, when Telefónica is due to report its first-quarter earnings.If successful, the deal would radically reshape the U.K telecom industry, creating a competitor to the country’s top operator, BT Group, (BT.A.U.K.) by combining the 34 million customers on O2’s mobile network with Virgin Media’s 3.3 million mobile customers and its 6 million broadband users.Analysts at New Street Research pegged the value of the deal at £28 billion, including debt and synergies.Under the terms being discussed, the new company would be owned equally by both companies, with Liberty Global making a cash payment to Telefónica, according to people familiar with the matter. ITV, Britain’s biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, which is 10% owned by Liberty, wouldn’t be included in the new venture, those people said.Liberty Global declined to comment.Shares in Liberty Global were up 0.7% to $22.41 in New York trading Monday morning. Telefónica’s stock rose 3.4% to €4.31 in early afternoon European trading on Monday.Telefónica has been looking at options for O2 since 2016 when European regulators blocked its planned £10.3 billion sale of the mobile business to CK Hutchison (0001.Hong Kong), the owner of Three, on the grounds that the deal would have left the U.K. with just three major mobile-phone-network operators, resulting in higher prices and less choice for consumers.A deal with Liberty Global would help it significantly reduce the Spanish telecoms debt load, which stood at almost €37 billion at the end of 2019.Malone, who also controls Discovery Communications, earned the nickname the Cable Cowboy after making his fortune through a string of deals that transformed and helped consolidate the U.S. cable industry into one dominated by a handful of players.If Liberty Global and Telefónica pull off their planned deal, it would be a major coup at a time when global deal making has collapsed, as companies focus on liquidity and preserving cash amid the coronavirus crisis. There were just $789.8 billion in deals announced worldwide during the first four months of 2020, down 39% from a year earlier and the lowest year-to-date level since 2013, according to data from Refinitiv.
                Liberty Global bought Virgin Media, which offers pay-television, broadband, and phone packages in the U.K., in a cash-and-stock deal worth $23.3 billion in 2013. In the U.K., Virgin competes with Sky, which is owned by Comcast (CMCSA), in pay-TV, and with BT and Sky in broadband.The deal would be a blow to Vodafone (VOD), which signed a deal last year with Virgin Media in the U.K. for the two companies to use each other’s networks beginning in 2022. “A merger would mean that Vodafone faces a stronger converged competitor,” Goldman analysts said. They estimated that the contract, which is worth around £100 million in revenues, could also be at risk if the deal between Telefónica and Liberty goes ahead.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the iShares Edge MSCI USA Size Factor ETF (Symbol: SIZE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $100.92 per unit.


With SIZE trading at a recent price near $65.91 per unit, that means that analysts see 53.12% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of SIZE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are RingCentral Inc (Symbol: RNG), CBRE Group Inc (Symbol: CBRE), and (Symbol: LBTYA). Although RNG has traded at a recent price of $138.96/share, the average analyst target is 73.27% higher at $240.78/share. Similarly, CBRE has 58.33% upside from the recent share price of $38.40 if the average analyst target price of $60.80/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LBTYA to reach a target price of $24.58/share, which is 57.79% above the recent price of $15.58. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of RNG, CBRE, and LBTYA:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"(RTTNews) - Video, broadband and communications major Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA, LBTYB, LBTYK) announced Tuesday that it has terminated discussions regarding the combination of UPC Switzerland and Sunrise Communications.Liberty Global and Sunrise announced a binding agreement in February this year and the combination received unconditional regulatory approval in September. However, in October, Sunrise canceled its extraordinary general meeting, with approval from Liberty Global. The cancellation was due to a dispute with its largest shareholder and the Share Purchase Agreement providing for the transaction was terminated in November.After payment to Liberty Global of a 50 million Swiss francs break fee, negotiations continued till now.Mike Fries, CEO of Liberty Global, now said, ""We wish Sunrise well but we are moving on. Despite our willingness to show significant flexibility on terms, it's clear to us that the Sunrise Board of Directors and their largest shareholder cannot agree amongst themselves on the best path forward.""The company further said it will consider other strategic options for UPC Switzerland, following its successful turnaround plan and free cash flow generation.

"Investors in Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options become available this week, for the March 20th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $20.00 strike price has a current bid of 75 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $20.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $19.25 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $20.52/share today.

Because the $20.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.75% return on the cash commitment, or 24.46% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $22.50 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $22.50 strike represents an approximate 10% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

With QQXT trading at a recent price near $56.64 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.92% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of QQXT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), and Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $22.27/share, the average analyst target is 21.46% higher at $27.05/share. Similarly, EBAY has 18.78% upside from the recent share price of $34.90 if the average analyst target price of $41.45/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DLTR to reach a target price of $104.00/share, which is 16.24% above the recent price of $89.47. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, EBAY, and DLTR:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"nvestors in Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options become available this week, for the December 20th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new December 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $22.50 strike price has a current bid of 45 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $22.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $22.05 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $23.99/share today.

Because the $22.50 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.00% return on the cash commitment, or 12.36% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $23.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $25.00.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $25.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $25.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - “British Broadband” is a catchy alliterative title, but that’s about all. The opposition Labour party on Thursday announced it wants to nationalise telecoms provider BT’s network in order to give everyone speedy fibre connections. State ownership might fix the country’s lagging communications infrastructure. But the promise of free web surfing risks condemning the idea to previous failed experiments in public ownership like British Coal or carmaker British Leyland.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal drags Britain’s relatively poor levels of connectivity into the heart of the Dec. 12 election. BT’s fibre network currently reaches just 1.6 million homes, 9% of the total and way behind Spain and France. The company could crank up investment, but needs to provide a return to shareholders. Nationalising BT’s Openreach network would allow the state to complete the task.That’s an expensive proposition, though. Openreach earned 2.4 billion pounds of EBITDA in the year to March. Valued at the 5 times multiple investors currently attach to the whole of BT, buying it back might cost taxpayers 12 billion pounds. Labour reckons extending the fibre network to 18 million homes would cost an additional 20 billion pounds. BT Chief Executive Philip Jansen says the bill would be twice as high.But Labour is taking the idea further by promising to provide fibre broadband to the entire population free of charge. That cranks up the costs. Labour estimates the cost of running the fibre network at just 230 million pounds a year. Fibre is cheaper to maintain than old copper networks but that’s still hard to square with Openreach’s annual operating expenses of about 2.6 billion pounds. To pay for the giveaway, Labour wants to tax multinationals like Amazon according to their presence in the United Kingdom, rather than on the earnings they report locally. How much this would raise is unclear. So is the question of compensating rival UK broadband providers like Liberty Global and Comcast-owned Sky, whose businesses would presumably be wiped out.Opinion polls suggest Labour’s chances of forming a government that could implement the plan are slim. This helps explain the less than 2% drop in BT shares on Friday morning. British politics could do with a healthy debate about its broadband needs. Unfortunately, the unbaked idea of free internet for all undermines that discussion.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Breakingviews - UK Labour’s broadband plan is free of most logic@2019-11-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/breakingviews-uk-labours-broadband-plan-is-free-of-most-logic-2019-11-15

The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.82% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.01% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 57%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 44%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $24.80) to be 32%.

"nvestors in Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options begin trading today, for the November 8th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new November 8th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $22.50 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $22.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $22.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $24.79/share today.

Because the $22.50 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $24.79/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $25.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.28% if the stock gets called away at the November 8th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (Symbol: IYC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $243.54 per unit.


With IYC trading at a recent price near $221.66 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.87% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of IYC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Lithia Motors Inc (Symbol: LAD), Tiffany & Co. (Symbol: TIF), and (Symbol: LBTYA). Although LAD has traded at a recent price of $129.92/share, the average analyst target is 11.72% higher at $145.14/share. Similarly, TIF has 10.66% upside from the recent share price of $91.34 if the average analyst target price of $101.08/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LBTYA to reach a target price of $29.93/share, which is 10.45% above the recent price of $27.10. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LAD, TIF, and LBTYA:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"he Over-the-top (OTT) streaming war is intensifying.   built it and now others are going to milk it. After losing shows like ""The Office"" and ""Friends,"" Netflix spent a  Netflix is trying to fill the huge gap after losing three of its top shows. On the other hand,   is launching its streaming service on Nov. 12.It's far from a duopoly in streaming. In addition to Netflix and Disney, consumers can choose from , , , Virgin Media which is owned by , and private companies with streaming services: BBC, All4, ITV, and Sky. We can expect  , NBC Universal, which is owned by to enter the streaming market very soon, too. Comcast is starting  for internet customers. Which entertainment company will win this battle?A Disney+ plan will cost $6.99 per month and a bundle will cost $12.99 per month. The basic Netflix plan is $8.99 (Single Device) and the standard Netflix plan is $12.99 (Two Devices). Hence, Disney's stand-alone plan is lower than half the price of Netflix.  will need to decide if they would pay $12.99 per month for three services or pay the same for a single video service. Disney is a three-headed monster with Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. Hulu offers a $5.99 subscription plan, cheaper than Netflix, as well as a no commercials plan for $11.99 that eliminates the majority of ad breaks. It has a subscriber base of 28 million and it has also partnered with music streaming giant Spotify. Image Source: Getty ImagesInvestments made by Netflix can be justified if it continues to add new subscribers to the base, but it has been losing momentum when it comes to adding subscribers. Netflix lost more than 130,000 customers in the U.S. in the second quarter. This is the first domestic subscriber loss for Netflix in the last decade. Its estimates were targeting 5 million new subscribers but it only added 2.7 million and a deficit of 2.3 million subscribers is drastic. Although Netflix has received critical acclaim for producing original content, it takes a lot of money to do so. Netflix is burning through cash and has taken on loads of debt. The current valuation of the company is built on an assumption that the trend will continue but it could lead to more being shaved off from its valuation in the coming quarters. Netflix is worth $157 billion. Netflix's valuation grew 3.8 times over the last two and a half years, in part because Netflix is openly traded in the market.The company's incremental expenses are 50% higher than its incremental revenue. It has a $3 billion loss in non-GAAP free cash flow during 2018. It has a low quarterly current ratio of 0.85 which clearly shows that the repayment of debt is going to be difficult for the company. An asset to liability ratio, or , below 1 is not good; a current ratio of 2 is excellent. Netflix spends more than $12 billion on content and it is expected to spend $17.8 billion by 2020. This shows that it might be difficult for Netflix to reduce the costs anytime soon and unless its revenues surge, the company will have a difficult time to grow its operating income. This will eventually bring down the valuation of the stock. Disney's operating income showed a 35% decline year over year and the operating expenses stood at $17.69 billion, a 56% increase year over year. It has a current asset to liability ratio of 0.70 and a non-GAAP free cash flow loss of $2.92 billion. Hulu is valued at $15 billion. It grew 2.6 times in two and a half years. Hulu continues to spend big on content. Out of the $4.2 billion revenue generated in 2018; Hulu earned 36% from ads and 54% from the on demand subscribers. Hulu spends more than $2.5 billion on content and it is expected to lose $1.5 billion this year. It is estimated that Hulu will start turning a profit in 2023. Hulu would be more valuable if it were a separate, publicly traded company. The current valuation of Disney is riding high on the expectations that the company will generate high revenue after the launch of its streaming services. However, it is too soon to tell. Netflix's stock soared to an all time high in 2018 and since then, it has faced tough obstacles as the field became more crowded. It's no longer a favorite stock. It enjoyed a meteoric rise in 2018 and has come back to earth a bit, in the form of a 40% correction. The stock has been down since the start of the year. This week, it fell to its lowest since January after co-founder Reed Hashtings said he sees tough competition from Disney and Comcast. Many investors sold their Netflix shares after news of the company losing U.S. subscribers in its second quarter. Concerns related to growth are also rising as the competitive landscape changes and the cost of customer acquisition is on the rise. Pain for Netflix's stock is not likely to ease until it shows consistency in growth in the paid subscriber base.Image Source: YChartsDisney's revenues fell below analyst estimates and its stock price fell about 4% last week. Disney's stock decline was less drastic than that of Netflix. In terms of valuation, Disney looks stronger than Netflix. The gap is pretty wide at the bottom where Netflix has depressed earnings, high cash outflow and low subscription numbers. Disney's stock is currently trading at a discount compared to Netflix's stock. Disney has a forward P/E ratio of 21.32 and Netflix has a P/E ratio of 55.74. There has been significant volatility in Netflix shares, so investors who can't stomach a constantly moving stock price would do best to avoid this stock for the time being. Netflix needs to change course and stop relying on the past strategy where it was a single player in the industry. It will have to find ways to stand out in a crowded streaming market. Disney is clearly shaping up to be a Netflix killer. You can avoid the stock but keep your favorite shows. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Streaming Battleground: Disney vs. Netflix@2019-09-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/streaming-battleground%3A-disney-vs.-netflix-2019-09-27

"ReutersBy Liam Proud(The author is a Breakingviews columnist.)LONDON, March 8 ( Breakingviews) - Vodafone has come up with a neat financial trick to avoid raising equity at a time when its stock is depressed. The telecom group is using derivatives, convertibles and hybrid bonds to bolster its balance sheet and fund its 18.4 billion euro acquisition of Liberty Global assets. However smart, it still leaves the telco at the mercy of rating agencies and markets.Read's first fix was to issue hybrid debt - securities which can defer coupons, allowing rating firms to count them as half equity in their models. In October Vodafone sold 4.2 billion euros of them. The problem is that selling the full 10 billion euros of hybrids that Vodafone would need could get expensive, given its current indebtedness.That's why Read this week used another kind of funky bond. Vodafone issued 3.4 billion pounds of so-called mandatory convertibles, which turn into shares in 2021 and 2022. That merely defers the dilution: in two and three years Vodafone will be forced to issue stock at today's price. To cancel that out, Read is saying he may buy back shares, and has bought options on Vodafone's stock to fix the price.The net effect is to give Vodafone the option of raising funds more cheaply once its balance sheet is healthier. If its stock price soars, Read can buy back the shares with profit from the options, and raise equity if he still needs to. And if the stock tanks, he can choose not to buy them back, issuing shares at the current price.There are a couple of snags. To get rating agencies comfortable with the buyback, which could make the convertible look suspiciously like disguised borrowing, Vodafone is stressing that it's optional and says it will fund any buyback with even more hybrid bonds. It will also need to refinance the 4.2 billion euros of hybrids already issued in October. That could get expensive if investors lose their taste for funky securities.A bigger danger is that rating agencies decide that the mandatory convertible and buyback isn't really equity, or change their treatment of hybrid bonds, forcing Read to turn to shareholders. At that point, he may wish he had simply asked them to cough up in the first place.CONTEXT NEWS- Vodafone on March 5 raised 3.44 billion pounds through the issuance of two tranches of mandatory convertible bonds maturing in March 2021 and March 2022. The net proceeds will be used to finance its acquisition of Liberty Global's cable assets in Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.- The bonds will convert at maturity into shares representing almost 10 percent of Vodafone's current share capital. The company run by Nick Read said it could buy back the shares in order to offset the dilution for investors. Any buyback would be funded by issuing hybrid bonds, and would be ""taken independently of the conversion of the bonds and will be dependent on market conditions and Vodafone's financial position and outlook at the relevant time"".- Vodafone has bought options to fix the price of the potential buyback. The annual cost of the options plus coupons is between 2.2 percent and 2.5 percent a year, or about 1 percent when swapped into euros. Convertible bondholders will also receive an adjustment for dividend payments owed before the point of conversion.Placing The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Vodafone's financial juggle papers over risks@2019-03-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vodafones-financial-juggle-papers-over-risks-2019-03-08

"ReutersZURICH, Feb 27 () - Sunrise Communications has entered ""advanced discussions"" to buy Liberty Global's Swiss business in a deal which values the internet and digital television provider at 6.3 billion Swiss francs ($6.30 billion).Sunrise said it would only pursue a deal for UPC Schweiz if it was ""strategically compelling and demonstrably value creative for its shareholders,"" and said no final decision had been made.""In the event of a transaction, Sunrise is committed to a prudent capital structure and to retaining its existing progressive dividend policy,"" the mobile phone and internet services company said late on Tuesday.Analysts have said a tie-up makes sense, given that Sunrise and UPC's fixed and mobile services would make the combined entity a stronger rival to the dominance of state-controlled Swisscom.Zurich-based Sunrise confirmed earlier this month it was negotiating to buy the UPC business, which has 1.1 million TV customers but falling subscriptions, and 138,000 mobile phone clients in Switzerland.Sunrise is due to report its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, while Liberty Global is due to report its full year results later on Wednesday.($1 = 1.0004 Swiss francs)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Sunrise in advanced talks for Liberty Global's $6.3 bln Swiss unit@2019-02-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sunrise-advanced-talks-liberty-globals-63-bln-swiss-unit-2019-02-27
"ReutersBy John Revill and John MillerFeb 27 () - Sunrise Communications'$6.3 billion deal to buy U.S. cable giant Liberty Global's Swiss assets, announced on Thursday, immediately hit a snag as a key shareholder said it would shun a planned rights issue to finance the acquisition.Sunrise said earlier on Thursday that it had agreed to buy UPC Switzerland from John Malone'sLiberty Global and that it would finance the transaction with a $4.1 billion rights issue.In a potential obstacle, however, Freenet, which owns a nearly 25 percent stake in Sunrise, said it would not participate in the rights issue, arguing that it saddles existing investors with all the risk.Sunrise shares fell as much as 13 percent after the deal was announced as analysts predicted Freenet may not have the appetite for the rights issue and were down 10.3 percent by 1345 GMT.Sunrise said it will pay Liberty Global around 2.7 billion Swiss francs in cash and assume 3.6 billion francs of UPC's debt.Jefferies analyst Ulrich Rathe, who called the valuation of the deal ""rational"" given its potential synergies, said Freenet's opposition might not be a dealbreaker.Shareholder approval was ""not a foregone conclusion"" given Freenet's stance. However, with only a simple majority of votes needed at an extraordinary shareholder meeting, opposition by Freenet may not be insurmountable, Rathe said.Freenet, a German telecommunications and web content provider, concluded that Malone was getting too good a deal.""Freenet AG will not participate in the capital increase,"" it said in a statement. ""Regardless of the investment volume, the transaction design disturbs us. It releases the seller from all obligations and the risk is borne especially by the old shareholders.""UPC Switzerland's fixed and mobile services will help Sunrise go head-to-head with Swisscom. The UPC business has 1.1 million TV customers, albeit with falling subscriptions, and 138,000 mobile phone clients in Switzerland.Sunrise said the deal gives it a chance to leverage its brand name and distribution network ""to improve the current negative trajectory of UPC Switzerland by cross-selling fixed broadband and TV offers to existing Sunrise customers.""""We have all the ingredients to win,"" Sunrise Chief Executive Olaf Swantee said, adding job cuts were coming.The company said the deal would create synergies of 2.8 billion francs, which analysts at Bank Vontobel called ""considerably ahead of our estimate and provide the bulk ofvalue creation potential"".MALONE CASHES OUTFor Malone, founder and chairman of Liberty Global, it marks more trimming of European assets including in Germany, Austria and eastern Europe, but not necessarily the end of his dealmaking as he deploys roughly $15 billion in proceeds.Analysts said he may use the proceeds for more deals. Ameet Patel, at Northern Trust Capital Markets equity sales, saw two scenarios.""First is a deal in the UK, where combining Virgin Media with O2 seems like a no-brainer on paper. That would create the opportunity to build a smartly-branded converged challenger to BT,"" he said.Alternatively, Malone may just return the cash to shareholders, which could indicate he sees a structural challenge to cable from next-generation 5G telecoms networks.Sunrise's Swantee said integration of Liberty's UPC Switzerland could cost up to 150 million francs and the deal would likely lead to a one-level credit rating cut.The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019 and add to Sunrise's equity free cash flow per share from the first year after that.Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and LionTree served as financial advisers to Liberty Global, while Deutsche Bank, UBS and Morgan Stanley advised Sunrise.($1 = 1.0014 Swiss francs)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Sunrise challenges Swisscom with $6.29 bln deal for Liberty Global assets@2019-02-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sunrise-challenges-swisscom-629-bln-deal-liberty-global-assets-2019-02-28

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

We certainly appreciate you joining the call today. I know, it's a bit late in Europe, actually where I am now. So we'll get right to it. I'll kick off the prepared remarks and then hand it over to Charlie, after which we'll take your questions. I understand that we haven't allowed much time for you to grab the results presentation off of our website. But if you do get a chance, I think you'll find the slides, particularly useful as you walk through the call, and I'll begin on Slide 4. With some highlights, the first of which not surprisingly addresses the announcement today regarding the sale of our Swiss business for CHF6.3 billion or around 10 times this year's operating cash flow.I'm going to talk more about this deal in a moment, but view through just about any lens. The last 14 months for us have been pretty transformational after two decades of buying, building, and growing world-class cable operations in Europe, we have now announced or completed transactions to exit 6 of our 12 markets at premium valuations between 10 times and 12 times operating cash flow.I'm sure, you're all keeping track, but in case, you're not, together these deals, the Swiss deal, the sale of Germany, in Eastern Europe to Vodafone, the disposal of our DTH business and then of course the sale of Austria represent an aggregate enterprise value of $31 billion and net cash proceeds to the Company, both received and pending of $16 billion. As you said many times, it has long been our ambition to create or enable national champions in Europe and we couldn't be more proud of these combinations, each of which is going to challenge incumbents, accelerate innovation and benefit customers for years to come.Again, more detail on the Swiss transaction in just a moment. The second highlight here, we also announced solid results in our continuing operations here. Virgin Media delivered around 4% revenue and OCF growth in 2018. Even with a tough comp in Q4 last year. UK ARPU continues to rise at the 2% level and we added nearly 290,000 RGUs. We are going to talk quite a bit about Virgin today.Telene  ed 8% OCF growth for the full year, and that was driven by the last phase of mobile synergies and the strong efficiency program and then together all of our continuing operations, so also including Switzerland reported consolidated rebased revenue and OCF growth of 2.2% and 3.5% respectively.Interestingly, if you back out, Switzerland which we will do in our 2019 guidance, those numbers will be 3% and 6.3%. And then lastly, VodafoneZiggo, our JV in Holland, which we don't consolidate has turned the corner and is guiding to positive operating cash flow growth in 2019. And the third major bullet here, the third major point on this slide is that our free cash flow profile continues to improve. We hit the $1.6 billion free cash flow target for 2018 at guidance FX rates and we saw operating free cash flow growth -- OCF growth increase over 20% from both continuing operations and the full company.Charlie is going to take us through 2019 guidance in a moment, but I'll just mention right upfront that we are forecasting an approximate 20% reduction in CapEx this year as we start to monetize the meaningful investments we've made in network expansion, capacity and product development.So beginning on Slide 5. I'll spend a few minutes on the deal we just announced today to sell 100% of our UPC Switzerland business to Sunrise Communications for CHF6.3 billion in cash. Looking at the industrial logic of this combination is really compelling in our view, Switzerland is one of the more advanced and competitive markets in Europe with quad-play bundles, superfast broadband, and strong video platforms available from multiple providers. And UPC and Sunrise together are going to create the leading converged challenger to Swisscom with scale across all elements of the quad play bundle, something that is surely needed and I think will benefit retail and enterprise customers there.Obviously, we're pleased with the price, which equates to 10 times this year's operating cash flow for our asset which has been in turnaround mode. And after debt and working capital adjustments, the CHF6.3 billion headline price should net a little over CHF2.6 billion and for reference the Swiss franc and the dollar are just about a parity. On timing, we expect the deal to close by the end of 2019, and as with our Vodafone transaction, will determine the most optimal use of proceeds as we get closer to that point.Like the other deals we've closed or announced this transaction highlights our ability to buy, build, integrate and grow our cable and broadband businesses as well as our track record of value creation. As we did, we announced the German deal for example in the left hand side of Slide 6, you'll see some operating metrics for Switzerland over the last 13 years. During that time frame, we've increased ARPUs and revenue over 50% or about 3.5% per year. We took OCF margins from the mid 30s to nearly 60% and we grew operating cash flow by 6.5% on average year-over-year.On the right hand side of that slide, you'll see what we -- when we bought the business, we invested around $1.6 billion of equity and since then we've distributed nearly $4 billion to the parent company, that's after payment of interest and debt expenses and we'll collect another CHF2.6 billion of net proceeds in this deal. So that's 4 times our original investment and a high teens IRR over 13 years. I really couldn't be prouder of our local operating team, they're really, really proud and while it's a bittersweet moment for us, we know that Sunrise and UPC together will be a stronger, more competitive platform.So after all this activity and what does Liberty Global look like on a pro forma basis. Well Slide 7 is a simple chart showing just that. First, we will continue to be Europe's leading cable operator with the largest pay TV and broadband platforms in six core European markets. That includes the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Poland and Slovakia where we serve over 23 million fixed RGUs, 5.9 million mobile subscribers and generate $10.4 billion (ph) of annual revenue and $4.8 billion of consolidated operating cash, so that's before corporate revenue and costs. Our 50-50 JV with Vodafone which course we don't consolidate adds another 10 million fixed RGUs, and 5 million mobile customers, as well as $4.6 billion of annual revenue and $2 billion of operating cash flow.Especially in Western Europe, these are scale platforms with high OCF margins, declining CapEx intensity and meaningful free cash flow growth in front of them, and in the cases of Holland and Belgium, we are fully converged with fixed to mobile networks, while Virgin relies on a terrific MVNO with 20% of our broadband base already signed up to a Virgin Mobile service. And the blue box on the far right hand side of the slide, we include, I think for the first time our non-operating asset. So that would be our expected pro forma cash proceeds from the three pending deals of around $15 billion, as well as our existing investment portfolio.So our stakes in ITV, all three Media, Lionsgate and Formula E along with our Ventures portfolio, all of which we conservatively value at $2 billion and then we show our considerable tax assets, including $20 billion in the UK that should shelter taxable income in that market for a very long time. We believe the net present value of tax attributes in Europe, including the UK to be in excess of $2 billion today. Now, while this is not an official sum of the parts valuation, it, it does form the basis of that work, which apparently, we're not allowed to do for you, but we can lay out two numbers.And both of which are shown on the chart, the first is the expected cash proceeds from the three pending deals that equals to about $20 per share. And the second is the fair market value of our public shares in Telenet, which equates to about $4 per share. So the punch line here is that these two numbers alone gets you to about our current equity market cap, which means everything else on this page, Virgin Media, the Dutch JV our Ops in Eastern Europe, other corporate assets are not reflected in our stock today at all. Well, that the analysts are fleshing out for everyone as they see fit but the picture from our perspective is pretty clear. It almost doesn't matter what multiple you put on the cash flow, it doesn't matter what discounts you put on the cash or other assets, it's a pretty good valuation story, maybe even better by today's announcement. Now I will just cover two more operating slides and then I'll hand it over to Charlie. On Slide 8, we highlight Virgin Media's results and there are four big takeaways here in my opinion.The first is that Virgin delivered its fourth straight quarter of strong ARPU growth, up 2% year-over-year and that was underpinned by a number of factors including, of course, the price rise in Q4 of last year and our implementation of that which was a success, a disciplined approach to discounting and promotions with a focus on bundles and getting folks more for more and reduce churn as we rollout V6 boxes and Hub 3 routers and so are now in about 60% and 70% of our homes respectively.Our analysis and I'll emphasize our analysis indicates and on a percentage basis. We grew revenue, pay TV service, broadband service and our B2B business faster than anyone else in the sector last year, all while building nearly as many new homes as the entire industry combined. The second key takeaway is the hard work we've done to lay the foundation for continued growth in 2019 and beyond. That includes the launch of two gigabit cities in the UK, we are going to raise our top speed, our broadband speeds to 500 megabits per second, that's nearly eight times faster than anybody else in the market. We have improved WiFi apps, and more boosters. We will launch a new Horizon 4 UI, which will be materially better than what we've got there today featuring voice search and better graphics. This is what we rolled out in Switzerland recently, NPS went up 36 points and we're going to make it easier for customers to buy, change and pay for services through our online platform and by my Virgin app.Thirdly, I want to be sure to highlight some inorganic headwinds that Virgin will encounter in this fiscal year and that will impact 2019 growth rates. That includes some regulated network taxes of GBP32 million, some negative regulatory impacts in the mobile business of about GBP17 million from things like roam-like-home and mobile termination rates and both contractual and potential increases in programing cost between GBP60 million and GBP80 million on an annualized basis. So that together these headwinds add up to about GBP110 million to GBP130 million and that's going to impact the growth rate for Virgin in 2019 on OCF. And then the final point here is that we continue to deliver organic RGU ARPU and OCF growth while reducing capital intensity. From nearly 34% in 2017 to 29% in 2018 on the back of more efficient construction costs, lightning, more targeted rollouts of V6 and Hub 3 CPE and again the ability to monetize our prior spend. That drove operating free cash flow growth or OFCF growth of 48% and we continue to see that in 2019.And now on Slide 9, we highlight results for our Benelux operations beginning with Telenet on the left. If you recap their  two weeks ago, you know that they ended the year with broadly flat revenue but we're able to fight through regulatory and competitive headwinds to achieve strong operating cash flow growth of 8% and adjusted free cash flow of EUR420 million.The SFR migration was a drag on net adds for sure in '18, but that should be over now. In fact, if you exclude the impact of the SFR customer migration, subscriber trends were actually better in the fourth quarter. Turning to the strong product lineup going into 2019 including the WIGO bundles, which should we talk about a lot. An exclusive partnership with HBO, the rights for the Premier League, Horizon 4 and EOS but I'm particularly excited about Telenet WIGO bundle for Millennials and digital savvy customers is an app based TV experience with 200 megabit fixed broadband connectivity at generous mobile data allowance and zero rating for our video services, so there was no set-top, superior broadband and a great mobile offering.Now that said, 2019 will be a transition year for Telenet. A fully realized base synergy is a loss of a large MVNO contract and continued regulatory pressure will impact revenue and OCF growth. On adjusted free tax flow, sorry, adjusted free cash flow will remain strong in 2019 at EUR380 million to EUR400 million as 2018 was a peak CapEx year. Now in the Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo reached a positive inflection point on OCF growth in the fourth quarter. Now while Q4 revenue was roughly flat year-over-year, OCF grew 6.5%, setting the stage for solid momentum heading into 2019. On the top line, the fixed business continue to drive steady financial growth and mobile revenue declines began to stabilize.Looking ahead, VodafoneZiggo's launch plan for Horizon 4 remains on track for the first half of '19 while 5G showcases and one-gig rollouts were set for 2020. The bottom line is the convergence strategy in Holland is working with over 1 million households and half the eligible SIMs taking a converged bundle. Their guidance is for moderate OCF growth to 2019 supported by ongoing synergies and then again the JV returned over EUR700 million to us and Vodafone during 2018 and are guiding to $400 million and to $600 million in shareholder cash returns in 2019. So I'll end with four key priorities for 2019 on Slide 10. Obviously, the first and foremost, we are focused on closing the pending M&A transactions. The Vodafone deal is of course working its way through the European Competition Commission and we feel positive about both approval and timing there and the Swiss transaction we believe will receive a very favorable review from both the telecom and competition authorities in Switzerland and should close by year end.Second, as a result of these deals and the changing shape of our business, we're in the midst of resetting our operating model to be more efficient, more agile and better positioned for the next phase of growth and opportunity. You might have seen that we already announced some of these changes and we will have more to talk about through the summer.Third, it bears repeating again that after an incremental 2 billion of CapEx over the last three years, above what would have been our steady state capital intensity, you can expect us to continue scaling back CapEx this year and beyond. As I said, we're guiding to an approximate 20% reduction in CapEx, year-over-year on continuing operations, taking advantage of our recent investments in capacity, products and CPE as result will drive OFCF growth up over 50% this year.And then finally, as I've discussed on every call, we are in the process of developing plans for our excess cash when these pending deals close with a focus on value creation and we'll have more to say about that of course, as the year unfolds.So, Charlie, over to you. -- So thanks, Mike. I'll move to the slide titled revenue and OCF growth. Now this is just an overview of the 2018 growth rates of our operations. And as you can see, the UK and Holland grew pretty well from a revenue point of view, aided by split contracts, but because of certain cost items things like compensation received in 2017 for historic breaches and broadband rate increases, the OCF growth rate was slightly lower. Overall, we did have a pretty respectable mid single-digit growth and later in the presentation, I'll give you some insights on how much of that comes from lightning and how much of that comes from the rest of our business in the UK and Ireland.Belgium performed strongly in the cost-cutting side, but clearly had a negative revenue growth and they talked about that a lot in their results call. So I'm not going to do that today. So in fairness we have been signaling all year had a very tough time on the revenue side, we have translated into OCF losses and that continues to be work in progress as we do improve our video proposition. And then in Central and Eastern Europe, a pretty solid performance with low-single digit revenue and OCF growth. We also got our central costs down year-on-year. And I'm going to address that in more detail shortly. So in the aggregate, for the continuing operations, Q4 was 1.2% revenue and 2.9% OCF growth. And that was clearly impacted by the one-off last year which unrestricted the growth rates and with the revenue and OCF growth rate for the full year of 2.2% and 3.5% respectively.Turning to CapEx on the page titled P&E additions. We have broken our CapEx both by segment and by driver. A few high-level comments. Capital intensity is coming down, '17 and '18 were levels of investment for us and we look to revert to more normalized levels in the upcoming years. It was 32.9% in 2017, falling to 31% in 2018 and we're targeting a reduction in the region of 20% year-on-year for 2019. The UK has peaked in terms of CapEx. The V6 upgrade is largely behind us and you should see that number coming down pretty dramatically going forward. And similarly Telenets also guided declining CapEx as their network upgrades are completed and they finish their IT integration.In terms of where the money is being spent. You can see the numbers at the bottom of the page. CPE is 8% of sales, new build and upgrade, which also includes B2B CapEx was reduced from 8% of sales to 6% of sales and then we have investment in the capacity of the network of 4% and the money we spent on products and enablers which again we think has peaked and will come down further from the 6% level in 2018. And that's because we're through the heavy lifting on the entertainment and connectivity programs. And then finally baseline spend represents 8% of revenue and is essential our investments in IT and property platforms and again, we would expect to seem some decrease in that percentage in the upcoming periods.The last of our three standard slides provides a brief overview of our cash leverage and liquidity. Even without the Vodafone and Swiss sale proceeds, we have $4 billion of liquidity including $1.5 billion of cash and we continue to generate positive free cash flow. We are going to talk a lot in this presentation about free cash flow generation from the continuing operations. So we are going to par that for the time being. But the full company achieved $1.4 billion of free cash flow which of the original guidance exchange rates we provided is in line with our $1.6 billion guidance number.On leverage, we continue to do operator in the top end of our 4 times to 5 times range. We actually ended the year at a five times gross and a little less on the net side. I would highlight the impact that seasonality has on our leverage ratios which have calculated on the basis of our last quarter annualized OCF. We expect similar phasing in the first half of 2019 with higher ratios in Q1. And then finally, we executed $2 billion of share repurchases in 2018. Again, in line with what we told you.I'm now going to turn to three special topics that investors have asked for more details on. The first one is entitled understanding Lightning but in many ways is about understanding Virgin. What we've done here is present Virgin as two distinct businesses, which is actually how we look at it from an internal performance monitoring basis. The first business, legacy business will be called here rest of business is very similar to our Benelux operations. In fact, we would argue this is a business with actually superior, long-term revenue growth prospects. As you can see, in this year, we estimate our revenue growth was around 2%. But why do we say that? Because we think it has opportunities to grow, it's penetration of the SOHO market where it is relatively low versus the Benelux and also is fixed mobile convergence.We altered in the UK is a very rational pricing environment subject obviously to what goes on with Brexit. And historically, this has been a market where we have been able to hold volume constant on the footprint and drive pricing up around that 1.5% to 2%. The other business we have in the UK is Lightning. And we would describe this as potentially the fastest growing cable company at scale in the world and we've broken out for you here are the key KPIs to assess performance and returns.So I'm just going to go down the Lightning column. To date, we build 1.6 million Lightning homes, with 339,000 customers. So around that low 20% penetration, and that translates into around GBP161 million of revenue. And as we signaled previously, we actually think that with introductory discounts roll off, the Lightning customers are broadly in line in terms of ARPU with the legacy base and we currently estimate that the OCF margin is 56% because illegal to scale on your fixed cost things like finance.If you look at the construction CapEx. The key number is the cumulative cost per home and we're running 6 to 90 pounds per home since inception, we've started to come down as we get more sophisticated and efficient on the build, but currently that translates into a total spend in 2018 of GBP328 million, which also includes work in progress of the uncompleted homes and of course the CPE and installation cost which included in the other CapEx bucket.So the total CapEx in Lightning was around GBP400 million in 2018 and we estimate the cumulatively, we spent GBP1.4 billion on CapEx Lightning since inception. Another key point of this slide is the free cash flow. If you look at the operating free cash flow Lightning. We estimate that it's a negative GBP313 million to the extent to which you see that we debt financed that 1.4 billion of CapEx, which I think is a reasonable assumption at the Virgin blended cost of debt of around 4.8% that translates into something like GBP100 million negative free cash flow impact including interest.So, by contrast if you look at the core Belgium business actually going pretty well. As I discussed earlier it's a 2% revenue growth, but slightly lower on the OCF side I might mentioned many of the headwinds in 2018 that we talked about, which contributed to that. It's also probably true that as we started our planning a really focused on in this growth phase, we probably didn't put as much focus on the marketing for the core operations as we did on the growing operations and may also contribute to a slightly lower growth rate.In terms of that competition (ph), it's also a reasonable free cash flow conversion assets, on these numbers, our management account is converting 22P in every pound at the OCF level and we expect that number to go up as capital intensity declines. Because as you may recall in 2018, we spent a lot of money on the V6 box upgrade. We also benefit from substantial tax assets in the UK, as Mike highlighted earlier. So when you look at the free cash flow of Virgin, it's misleading to say that we are not making a loss of free cash flow, because you got two very different profiles.Now if you look at the right hand side of this page, we got some thoughts about how we would go from here. Well we think we are able to consistently build 400,000 to 500,000 homes a year. We do think MDUs are an area of opportunity, we are getting better understanding how we are going to market to these. And I think looks in particular pleased with this significant upside potential. Overall, in Lightning, we feel we're broadly in line with the original business case. The early cohorts are achieving long-term penetrations in excess of 30% and you can see that in the chart on the bottom right. These type of infrastructure investments are currently very much in vogue in the UK, but we believe Lightning is the most successful altnets building at scale and if you look at the valuations that infrastructure assets and fiber builds are attracting, clearly a very valuable asset in our minds for our shareholders.The second key question investors have asked us about is central costs. And we got a slide called changes to the operating model. But really the question is what are the central costs? What we did back in the day is triggered a series of activities out of our OpCos and perform them centrally because we thought we could drive scale, best practice and efficiency. And I think largely we would say that has worked. In terms of the types of spend, I really broke into two key buckets. And as you can see the numbers on the right hand side of the page, the first is technology and innovation, which is essentially all the stuff we do on behalf of the companies, so they get economies of scale and share product development costs. And that adds up to around $900 million OpEx and CapEx spend covering product development, technology strategy and shared platforms.Now, a lot of our spend will continue, but it would be funded by transition services agreements and you can see that already happening with the VodafoneZiggo payments to us. As well as payments from Liberty Latin America, Deutsche Telekom and obviously Vodafone and Sunrise when the transactions close. And in any case we believe that the $900 million has probably hit peak investment because we put a lot of money into the video and connectivity platforms during the Liberty GO phase, so you should see those numbers start to drift down over the upcoming years.The other bucket of cost is our corporate costs, which is $260 million of OpEx. This does the traditional corporate functions management, finance, legal, people actually includes procurement and that's where we've been really targeting the majority of our reductions as part of the broader reorganization. We're estimating that you should see a reduction of around 20% or more as part of that by the time we get to 2020 and that's been done by reducing layers, rationalizing functions and giving more responsibility to the country level as you can see it from the left hand side of the page. The last special topic is what is our pro forma free cash flow, so this is the free cash flow generated from the assets we retain. Now I've learnt a lot more about this over the past month. And I would like to learn and it's not a simple topic. And that the detailed technical explanation of how we calculated this and the adjustments we have made in the appendix. So if you want to get into the detail, I suggest you look at that.On this slide, if you go from the OCF down, you get to an OFCF for the 2018 continuing operations of $1.6 billion but that includes the estimated $420 million of negative OFCF contribution from Lightning. So you could actually argue the OFCF is higher. Then we have the interest, which is just over $1 billion. And then when you turn to tax, we paid $300 million and that's predominantly the Telenet and the US mandatory repatriation tax payments that we make. In terms of tax, the number will be broadly flat in 2019 as will the interest. And then we have the contribution from VodafoneZiggo. Actually the $294 million referenced here doesn't include another important contribution to us which we get from the asset and that's the repayment of EUR100 million shareholder loan and we expect to get the last of those payments next year as in the form of shareholder remuneration. So that gets you to a free cash flow before working capital items of $557 million. Now as there are lot of focus around working capital. And just to be clear, we think about it in three buckets. Ordinary working capital, operational finance and restructuring, and broadly speaking, we try and hold this within a range of plus or minus $100 million across the portfolio, which actually is what we did for the combined company in 2018, but what you'll see from the slide is that for the pro forma company, it's actually $168 million negative in 2018.So let me explain how that breaks down. Within our ordinary working capital, there is a few headwinds that we've detailed on the slide. For example, split contracts was a drag of around $100 million in 2018. Now, generally we don't choose to factor receivables at the mobile companies. So that's a tool we could use to reduce that working capital drag. In operational finance, we actually focus on vendor financing, where we are financing around 40% to 50% of the addressable spend. And to remind everybody, we do vendor financing if we believe we can get better terms from a price point of view and a better return on capital as compared to just trying to extend the payment terms to 90 days, and then the last bucket is restructuring, which will be impacted in 2019 by the changes in the operating model I discussed earlier. So all of that gets you to the pro forma free cash flow number of $389 million for 2018.Moving to the last slide, let me just round up. In terms of the 2019 outlook, we've given these numbers excluding Switzerland. Now what ultimately we think Swisscom will become discontinued operations under our accounting treatment. It will be dependent upon the shareholder vote, which means they may not be the case immediately. So I wanted to make sure that was clear to investors, as they think about our performance monitoring. The first guidance metric is rebased OCF which we are guiding as flat to down. Now, that might sound a little disappointing to investors. And I just wanted to give some color.Mike talked a lot about what's going on in the UK and we actually think if you take things like broadband rates and the programming headwinds, the UK is growing very nicely and I talked a lot about how happy we are with Lightning. But one of the reasons why we are being quite cautious about the UK is because of the possible effects of Brexit. None of us know what that's going to mean to the economic environment and we want to make sure that our investors have a range of possibilities. In terms of the other key driver of our OCF guidance, you know about Telenet, which has guided to its own investors to a negative OCF growth. There will be a significant reduction in our property and equipment additions. We are guiding you to $2.7 billion of current FX targeting roughly a 20% year-on-year reduction on 2018 Actuals.In our mind, that translates into the adjusted free cash flow of around $550 million to $600 million for the pro forma company, again excluding Switzerland. But just to emphasize, three key points. The first is that the number excludes any cash flow that we get out of the discontinued operations before closing, now how much that will be, will vary. For example, if we close the Vodafone transaction in July, we will have the semi-annual interest payments relating to Germany, if we close in June, we won't. But we think, assuming a mid year close, there should be around $250 million to $300 million cash flow contribution from those discontinued operations.Secondly, it also excludes the shareholder loan repayment from VodafoneZiggo which I talked about earlier, it's the EUR100 million. And finally, it includes the negative OFCF contribution from Lightning. Now if you do allocate the interest, I'd made the case, that's a $400 million to $500 million negative free cash flow hit and then getting to that is a very high growth, high return business. We'll update you more on the buybacks when we close the transactions, but for the time being, we are guiding to a $500 million buyback through the first half of this year.And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.A question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). And we'll take our first question from Nick Lyall with SocGen. -- Morning, guys. This is Nick at SocGen. Could I just ask two very quick ones please. Just -- you mentioned buybacks at the end there, Charlie, could you just mention things you're thinking about in terms of the mechanics and efficient sizes. What were you thinking about large buybacks and what might actually limit the size of the buyback, what should we be thinking about there.And secondly, could you just give us a rough idea as well of the cash contribution to the free cash flow to Switzerland, it may just be -- not the time to work out, but could you maybe just give us an update on that so we can -- so to do a like-for-like between the guidance and this year's number, please, thank you. -- Nick, it's Mike. I will take the buyback question. Charlie, you can work up the Swiss cash question. I mean, as we've said on most every call so far, we're not in a position today to describe either quantum or structure of buybacks with use of proceed. So you could easily determine those on your own. It's not that complicated. But I think at this stage, it's just premature to get into that kind of detail, but we're certainly working on alternatives.And as we have more information, we will absolutely let the market know, you want to talk about the Swiss cash, Charlie ? -- Yes, sure. Actually, it's tethered to the different years. In 2018, Swisscom was a very strong cash flow generator for us. And again, you get into this question, how you allocate the central costs by country. But I would characterize it as having a relatively low CapEx to sales ratios versus the other assets. Actually in 2019, there is a big shift. We are planning to and we'll continue to plan to rollout the EOS next generation boxes. And we'll also continue to push in a -- an upgrade at the 1G network, so I think you're going to see the free cash flow contribution in 2019 much lower and our numbers around $50 million. And I think, we'll compare it around $200 million, $250 million in 2018.And I want to emphasize, how you allocate the internal costs in 2018. Reasonable men (ph) could disagree with us, certainly how we look at it internally ?And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. -- Hi Vijay.Vijay, your line is open, you may begin. Vijay, please press *1 on your phone again. -- Can you hear us? -- Hear you now. Vijay, I think, they can hear us. -- Hi, sorry about that. I think you called out about GBP120 million of inorganic headwinds in 2019, which is about, I think about 600 basis points of headwinds. Can you just talk about how that sort of rolls off past 2019 for Virgin. And then, broadly speaking, obviously you don't want to talk about how much buyback you would probably consider at some point, but just want to understand now having sort of a single country play obviously Telenet has its own capital structure, Ziggo has its own but with the UK, Ireland, sort of play, what's the right amount of debt leverage for that entity ? -- So the question on, just whether the question is correct, Vijay. The question on debt is specifically around Virgin? -- Yeah. -- Okay. Yeah, I mean, I think, Charlie, can work up an answer to that. I think we're about where we want to be on that. Inorganic headwinds, Tom, you can jump in here. Obviously, the programing costs would annualize it to the extent that we have additional contractual cost that would hit. But remember, this year our costs are up about 5%, next year, it's more like 8% or 9%. So we don't -- we expect that to be a positive in the 2020 period, should not be a comparable hit.The broadband taxes, it's a big jump this year, I think it's doubling, something like that. It might, you can comment Tom, more specifically what it goes up next year, but it won't be as material. So without being specific, many of those inorganic headwinds will not be as impactful on a one-off basis in 2020.So we do expect in the longer term, picture here to return to more normalized growth in the UK and Ireland. Just to probably give you that benchmark, Charlie, you want to answer the second question on leverage ? -- Yeah, just clearly on the broadband range, because one more year and the (inaudible) keeps giving from the British government. But it does end in 2020. So 2021, we will be back on a normalized state on the rates. Look on the leverage, I think we've always said that 4% to 5% is up that range. Be at the bottom of the range if there was a hard component of mobile and also there will be some lower growth. So I think, we've articulated that UK looks pretty high growth assets. So I think we are very pretty comfortable where we are today at 5 times. Against that to the extent to which as you already pointed out, UK becomes a -- particularly major part of our portfolio. We don't have the diversity and the ability to shelter that. So we will have to take view on it. But I think, I am very comfortable at the 5 times where Virgin is today and there is no imperative to delever full (ph) for the transactions. -- All right. Thanks so much.And we'll take our next question from James Ratzer with New Street Research. -- Yes, thank you very much. Good evening, guys. Two questions, please. One on Switzerland with the Sunrise deal. I mean looks like fantastic terms for you. I mean to the extent that so good, what happens if Sunrise shareholders fail to approve the transaction terms, so I think that has to go to a shareholder vote on their side, what kind of security do you have or ability to potentially renegotiate or accept different terms if that has to be the case.And secondly on the UK business, could you just talk us through what happened on TV net adds, looked a bit weak in the fourth quarter, is that something one-off or more structural? Thank you. -- Hey, Tom, why don't you work up an answer or Lutz on the TV net adds. On the Swiss transaction. Yes, it is a good transaction and good terms for us, we would concur. On the other hand, it's also a good deal for them. I mean, it does provide scale in all the core products, it does give them network reach, high quality network reach, it does represent pretty material synergies and it gives them the clear number two position across the entire scope of the telecom market there.So I think their shareholders would all agree. Their shareholders will see this deal as being transformational for them and that will be something that we expect shareholders to approve. There is the small break fee, I'm not sure we're disclosing that. But it's in Swiss market is precedent, that's not a usually very large number.I think we are relying on their underwriters, who underwrite the rights offering. And we've been relying on their ability to make a very strong argument, which I think, Olaf will do convincingly that this is a transformational deal for that business, so we're pretty encouraged by it. But there is no mechanism as such to say, well if deal doesn't go our way, this is plan B, but we expect it to go the right way and we will -- that we will know that pretty quickly here. Tom, alluded to on net adds. -- I think on -- yes on TV net adds, I think, in the entire 2018 we have made 36,000 net adds, positive. It was weaker in Q4, the reason for that is two fold, one is, right, we did our price rise in Q4. And the other one was a deliberate decision to focus more on Full House and VIP customers using our V6 boxes and not too much to focus on Slayer (ph) in terms of acquisition. And you see that in higher free cash flow numbers.All right, and we'll move on to David Wright with Bank of America. -- Yeah, good, hello guys. Thank you for the -- taking the questions. On the UK again, please. We've obviously seen BT commit to a different pricing structure, which means there will be no price rise until April 2020. So effectively nothing through 2019 and then moving to structurally lower price rise of CPE, which is give or take 2%. In the UK, you guys have historically driven prices around 4% to 5% every 12 months and that's been a core driver of OCF. Do we think that another price rise to lap in sort of November '19 is perhaps now less likely given what we know BT comparative and do you see about 4% to 5% run rate dropping down to the sort of 2% levels that BT is now committed to? Thank you. -- I'll take that one. We're not going to provide today, David, any detail on pricing proposals this year or in the following years, we haven't announced that or even worked that out in any great detail. So we can't give you that headline. On the other hand I would point out that BT has been taking pretty regular price increases every nine months. I think this pause makes sense. You know and for them, to be honest with you, it's still at CPI, and there's -- certainly, there is no indication that I have received and Philippe or anyone else that this is the long-term plan. I'm not suggesting. I know that it's a temporary plan either just for this year but, as you probably know, we can't give you any guidance on future price increases before we talk to our customers about it except to say that at this point the status quo seems reasonable for us. -- I think, to add to that Mike, I think, two things, one thing is that if I haven't read it wrong. I think these no price rise in 2019 applies only for new customers, not necessarily for existing customer. And I think second thing is that Sky recently has announced then on the price rise. And I think third thing, you have to put also innovation potential in context with price rise, right. So and as Mike has said, before we get our Horizon 4 UI, we get full fixed mobile convergence. We get higher speeds. So I think we have a lot of innovations to satisfy our customers with -- which might give us some pricing power.And we'll take our next question from Polo Tang with UBS. -- Hi, I have actually got two questions. So just in terms of the Swiss deal, there have been on off talks, the past one is two years. Do you maybe talk to why the deal came together now. Was there any particular catalyst, and also did you insist on an all-cash deal or you open to taking equity in the merged entity. And my second question is really just about central costs. So you made a very helpful slide in terms of Slide 16. But I just want to clarify in terms of the numbers that you laid out there, was this net of the recharge benefits that you receive from VodafoneZiggo and can you also clarify the recharge benefits that you will get assuming the German and Swiss deals go ahead and when you talked about the reduction in terms of the central costs. Did I hear you correctly in terms of the hearing that you're looking to reduce these total central costs by 20% going forward. Thanks. -- Charlie, you can respond to that -- the central cost point, providing the short answer is those -- that $900 million does not include the quantum of revenue received. I'm not sure we're disclosing all those details, guys, so you work up that.On the Swiss deal, listen, it's actually been about a year that we've been in discussions with them, to be honest with you, that when in terms of substantive conversations around different ideas and structures, all transactions have a beginning and an end and there's no particular reason why this one took this amount of time or less or more. So there's not much drama to reveal to be honest with you.And the structures that have been discussed vary across multiple outcomes. As you might imagine, this one was the best for them and the best for us and I think, we think they have a great business. The fact that we're not taking shares in the business is not a reflection at all of our view of the business, we think it's going to be a powerful platform and a very successful company long term, just felt for us that this was the better outcome and the price we were able to realize, an all-cash deal was certainly more attractive to us than other alternatives. I don't know, do you want -- any more Charlie to the central cost question. -- Yeah, so just to confirm that's the gross cost. There is no revenues for example for VodafoneZiggo and Austria. Those numbers were about $150 million. The gross cost also actually included business are now place down which is a zero marginal -- low margin handset business about $100 million of costs.So that's one consideration. I think the other thing is that the TSA is going forward really with $400 million. We would estimate or that that could obviously move around. But it's not quite comparing apples with apples. So for example, in the $900 million, we're spending money on products for Germany that aren't required under the TSA. So we would actually reduce that spend accordingly becasue most of the spend is flexible, third-party contractor spend with very little internal waiver. And so I think it's quite hard to do an apples to apples but it's certainly true to say that the majority of the spend is going to forgo will be actually on behalf of the TSAs.Virgin and Lightning will remain a core anchor tenant as well as Eastern Europe. In terms of the reduction, we are registering a bigger costs. And I wouldn't want to characterize that as restructuring that's as much about efficiency, but also about the fact that there are certain items we are not going to spend. So in that or spend in the T&I area are only about $130 million, it's --- so most of it's just stuff that you can scale down or scale up. And the restructuring, the 20%. We talked about is totally focused on that $260 million and I think we said what we had to say about that, it's in certain activities.And we'll take our next question from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group. -- Hey guys, first, congrats on the attractive price you're able to get to the Swiss assets. Between the VOD sale, Austrian and the Swiss deals, your existing cash balance, you're going to have about roughly $17.5 billion in cash, should we still think sort of 50-50 between buybacks alternatives and then I've got a follow-up? -- I know you're going to ask that question, Jeff. And I think, yeah, and it's fair, but I think I'm going to have to say what I've said in the past, which was, it depends on a lot of different factors. The timing of completion, where the market is at that point, where we think the market is headed at that point, inorganic and financial opportunities which is -- will be one -- the one you're referencing, of course would be one. So I really can't give you any more color on that, but certainly as we get closer to these deals completing and they're still months and months away here, we will nail that down, but I appreciate the question. I can't really provide much more color than that. -- And then in terms of that VOD deal and I'm sure you are actively talking to regulators, do you still feeling very comfortable with the mid 2019 close of the deal. -- I am. Yeah, I mean that could mean June, July and with it we have, we're back working with them. The stop the clock is over. There is a milestone in March around the statement of injections that may or may not occur, but you can expect that we are in regular contact and certainly Vodafone leading the charge in regular contact with the Commission and by all accounts, and having been through many, many of these at this point, we have no reason to believe it wouldn't be a mid 2019 close. -- Thanks, Mike.And we will take our next question from Carl Murdock-Smith with Berenberg. -- Thank you. Two questions from me, please. First, just understanding the multiple on the Swiss transaction, 10 times OCF means you are expecting $630 million or $662 million if I add back in the TSA that you note on Slide 5 in the footnotes. That implies a 12% drop from the figure you've just reported for 2018. Quite a deterioration from the minus 8% you've reported this year, consensus was expected -- expecting an improvement. So what was causing the deterioration in trading in Switzerland, that you were expecting. And then secondly, just on the UK growth, on Slide 15, just to confirm, I think, two-thirds of the rest of business 2% growth is from mobile handsets this year. I was just wondering if you could comment, what the underlying cable growth is for the rest of the business. Thank you. -- On the Swiss math, it's not correct. And we're not going to provide independent guidance for Switzerland at this point, except to say that we also -- our budgeted number also assumed an improvement year-over-year in the growth outcome, so I am not sure, how you are getting to your math, it's certainly one way of getting there, but it's not accurate.On the UK growth, Tom, are you trying to respond to that? -- So I am just trying to identify Q4 table number, I think (Multiple Speakers) -- Yeah, I think the confusion I've got is that we would perhaps the version you're using including Lighting in it. I think the fact is that we believe that if you take out Lighting, the consumer business is still great. But you're quite right not growing at quite the 2% rate because that's -- a big part of that is there just the handsets and we also bring to this underlying growth the B2B business, so we don't believe that the growth in consumer business excluding Lightning is a negative growing business, but it's a growth business but not as much as 2% which is the blended average of the mobile B2B and Virgin cable. -- Well we know B2B growth is approximately 3%, mobile growth plus-minus 10%. And the other two are blended, that's another way to possibly answer the question. -- Helpful.All right. Moving on to Steve Malcolm with Redburn. -- Yeah, hi guys. I'm going to dig into the UK little bit and then ask a quick question on the Sunrise deal if I can. Just -- you mentioned Brexit. I guess calling it out a bit more than you have in the past. Are there any particular size in the business that you're worrying about on -- particularly of your B2B business, you have quite a lot of local government exposure in there. You managed to sort of growing that low single-digit growth for a bit and also on the handset side, I mean, you've obviously moved everyone to 3-year EIP deals, are you going to have a bit of an air pocket this year. We've read a lot about the extension of handset lifetimes, is that hitting that revenue line quite hard this year?And then just on the Swiss deal, do you happen to know if what Freenet's position is here because as I understand that they have a blocking minority here that I presume that the shareholder vote will require 75% approval. They have 24.5% on the basis don't know everyone turns up if they don't approve the deal, it's hard to see it going through. So any clarity you can give us on what Freenet position here would be -- would be very useful. Thanks. -- Yeah, I'm glad you asked that question. It's not a 75% approval, it's a 51% approval. So they do not have blocking position. And their position isn't necessarily known to us. I am not sure what Swisscom has disclosed or not about that, it shouldn't. The Board has approved the deal and Freenet might have its own views that the note they made clear to us, they have been made clear to Swisscom, I'm sorry to Sunrise. You might ask that question on their call tomorrow. Sunrise on their call tomorrow, but it doesn't require 75% approval, so I am glad you asked that question. On Brexit, we've done a lot of work, although Charlie chime in here, as every UK-based company has done to determine what -- where the vulnerabilities might be.I think, it's important to point out that we don't see meaningful vulnerabilities either in supply or people or the things that make programming contract or things that make the business tick. But at any UK-based business would be doing, we're evaluating the impact on consumers, as I've said consistently for a very long time now ever since Brexit would occurred. That the biggest concern we have is anybody would have in our position is how will consumers be impacted.So it's principally a revenue view of and there's lots of different variations on that. As you can imagine, different point of view of what will happen to GDP and what will happen to inflation and what will happen to unemployment. But our business is sound and solid, no matter what happens. These are sort of marginal deviations, if they occur at all, but no real material contractual or any sort of supply related challenges, I don't know Charlie if you want to add anything to that. -- No, I mean, it's well said. I think, look, as you rightly pointed out, none of us really know what's going to happen and will for instance going to occur. We are seeing little bit of softness actually in handset sales as you mentioned it, but remember that's really significant margin at first. I think it's too early to say, what's going to have the impact on local government. I think when we gave our guidance, it certainly show that there's a range of possibilities, becasue -- I think none of us know what the economics environment is going to be later in the year, but everyone is seeing material hit, what we're seeing and Lutz would comment on this, but I see more consumers waiting and seeing rather than diving into -- to new deals. So let's see how that -- end of March goes, and hope for the best. -- And Andrea, just confirm that the way I've described the Swiss Sunrise transaction is accurate. I know it is but chime in if you want. -- No -- yes. Absolutely, Mike. Hi, it's Andrea here. It is a 50% vote of the shareholders that are representative of meeting and we don't have any official news as to how Freenet is going to vote their shares at our meeting. It's obviously -- there's obviously RegG period that needs to be gone through before we get to that. So it's not suspect, we'll see how they play it, and they do that. As Mike said, they are putting their results tomorrow, so I am sure there will be chance to ask them.And we will take our next question from Ulrich Rathe with Jefferies. -- Yeah, hi. One question is that I have left is on the free cash flow, Charlie. I'm not entirely sure I can connect the new pro forma free cash flow easily to the continuing operations. Is there sort of an easy conceptual way to connect what you're highlighting for the 2018 pro forma to the $1.1 billion reported and continuing operations, particular, I'm wondering, is there a change in definitions here or is this the old free cash flow just in a different parameter. And if it is a change in definition, could you sort of just highlight motivations for what you have done and why you are introducing this in this particular way. And if I, if I may, a follow-up. I think, and Steve sort of asked this question about the handset life extension in the UK. Overall, about the sort of, I mean and a very easier way to ask this, I suppose is would you actually expect give and take for the development of this a big boost to the top line that you experienced in 2008 in VMED (ph), how you expect that to unfold in 2019. Thank you. -- Well on the free cash flow. We haven't changed our definition at all. This is the same definition we have been reporting to for the last couple of quarters. I got to be honest -- are we damn pleased when these transactions are placed becasue the concept of the pro forma adjusted free cash flow, as underlined with my Accountants is something that many, many can dispute an idea about. What this is really trying to do is, and I am very happy to take you through and all the guys, can take you through it offline.This is our best guess of how we would report the Company pro forma of the sales of the assets, the free cash flow of those assets and there is a series of footnotes that I can go through it offline but just to reiterate, there is no change in methodology. This is completely consistent with the, how we've done it in the previous quarters and indeed how 2018 is being compared to 2019 albeit 2019, it doesn't include Switzerland but yeah -- -- Yeah on the handset question. On the handset question, I think you're right, I mean, we've sold in a lot of handset into our customer base and that -- this has slowed down now a bit. Number two, as Charlie said, before customer demand especially on hardware and handset has slowed down, entire market is down 10% to 15% since December.But having said that, the SIM free market in UK is only 15%. As for instance the SIM free market in Germany is 50%. So huge opportunity to grow. And if you take that together with fixed mobile convergence. I would not think that we keep doing what we are doing. -- One more question, operator.Yes. We'll take our final question from Christian Fangmann with HSBC. -- Yeah, hi, it's Christian. Hope you're fine. Just wanted to ask about the Swiss transaction, the transfer of the UPC debt, how does it technically work? I mean the debt is not specifically debt at the Swiss entity. So just wanted to understand is only the Swiss bonds are being transferred or how does it work? Just to understand it technically. Thanks. -- Andre or Charlie -- yeah go ahead. Yeah. -- Yeah we are going to keep it as you probably -- are we going to address Roger (ph) but remember that we call this funny names around orphan and succession about. So I don't really want to get into the implications of that because there are lot more detail. But sufficing to say, that we are allocating and assigning with transactions some of the debt and UPC to the assets. And Andrea, you want to give more detail. -- Yeah, I think unless (Technical Difficulty) put around this, but I think the number, the numbers being displayed in the print or press releases and is basically a question of portfolio of bond and derivative securities that have been in the UPC credit pool that have been transferred over. Does that answer your question? -- All right. I will take that yes. Listen, we appreciate everybody joining the call especially folks in Europe, it's late, but we did want to be sure to get this announcement out as soon as we sign, which was just an hour or so ago before the call, so appreciate you joining. We're excited about this transaction in Switzerland. I will tell you, as I said in my remarks, it's a bitter sweet moment. Eric and more recently Severina have done a great job. The whole management team there over a decade or more has really done a great job building this Company. It's been a proud and incredible achievement for all of us to operate in this market and, but we do know that Sunrise is going to do tremendously well with these two businesses put together, it's going to be an terrific competitor, particularly in Swisscom, and it's the right thing for this market.So it's a win-win. It's certainly a win-win transaction. And a great time for us to build cash. As you've obviously noticed. We think at these multiples. We're doing the right thing here in terms of rebalancing the business and we're excited about how we could use that cash to create shareholder value. We always appreciate your support and trust in the Company in this team and we'll speak to you soon.

"ReutersBy John Revill and John MillerFeb 5 () - Switzerland'sSunrise Communications Group has confirmed it is in talks over a potential acquisition of broadband provider Liberty Global's Swiss business UPC Schweiz.Analysts have said a tie-up makes sense, given that Sunrise and UPC's fixed and mobile services would make the combined entity a stronger rival to the dominance of state-controlled Swisscom.Liberty has been hurt by weak operating momentum at its Swiss unit, making reduced exposure to the Alpine republic attractive for shareholders. The cable provider has already unloaded its unit in neighboring Austria.The Financial Times had on Friday that Sunrise was in advanced discussions over a potential deal .Sunrise confirmed late on Tuesday that it is in negotiations and that the proposed deal would not alter its progressive shareholder distribution policy, allaying analyst fears of reduced annual payments.It gave no further details, saying only that it would make a further announcement when appropriate.""We note the press release issued by Sunrise and have no further comment to make,"" a Liberty Global spokesman said.Analyst estimates give Liberty's Swiss unit a valuation of about 4.9 Swiss billion francs for a business that generates estimated core profit of about 700 million francs.Swisscom is by far the biggest telecommunications company in Switzerland, with 11.7 billion francs in revenue and 6.6 million mobile phone customers in 2017.Sunrise, by contrast, had a total of 3.4 million customers, with 2.4 million mobile phone customers, generating revenue of 1.85 billion francs in 2017.Smaller UPC had about 1.1 million TV customers, amid falling subscriptions, and 138,000 mobile phone clients in Switzerland, company documents show.Should a Liberty-Sunrise deal be completed, UBS analysts said Swisscom could suffer lower revenue from wholesale broadband and the loss of payments from UPC to use its network for its mobile business.""The majority of Sunrise's broadband customer base is currently provided through Swisscom infrastructure,"" said UBS analyst Nicholas Prys-Owen.""One area of synergy (with UPC) could be migrating some of these customers onto cable infrastructure.""Sunrise shares have dropped 9 percent this year, while Swisscom -- due to report 2018 earnings on Thursday -- is about flat.

"ReutersZURICH, Feb 7 () - Swisscom said it faced ""fierce"" competition with global internet companies while reporting 2018 net profit that matched expectationsamid looming market consolidation in Switzerland.The internet, mobile phone and digital television provider reported net profit down 3 percent to 1.52 billion Swiss francs ($1.52 billion), matching estimates in an Infront Data poll.The company, which is 51 percent owned by the Swiss government, proposed paying an unchanged dividend of 22 francs per share, in line with its previous guidance. It also plans the same payout for 2019 if it reaches its targets this year.""The biggest challenges in 2019 will remain market saturation, increasingly fierce competition and high price pressure,"" Schaeppi said in a statement.Competition could increase in Switzerland after Sunrise Communications Group confirmed this week it was in talks over a potential acquisition of broadband provider Liberty Global's Swiss business UPC Schweiz.Should a Liberty-Sunrise deal be completed, Swisscom could suffer lower revenue from wholesale broadband and the loss of payments from UPC to use its network for its mobile business.During 2018 Swisscom reported stable revenue at 11.7 billion francs, as a downturn Swiss business was offset by an improvement at its Italian Fastweb unit and cost cuts.For 2019, Swisscom said it expects net revenue of around 11.4 billion Swiss francs, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of more than 4.3 billion francs, up from 4.2 billion francs, partly due to accounting changes.($1 = 1.0023 Swiss francs)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Swisscom highlights fierce competition, posts in-line results@2019-02-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/swisscom-highlights-fierce-competition-posts-line-results-2019-02-07
 's  divestiture of its assets in Germany and Eastern Europe to Vodafone  is now facing a full-scale investigation (Phase 2 review) by European Union (EU) antitrust regulators,  Reuters.EU regulators believe that the transaction worth $21.8 billion (£17.13 billion) will give Vodafone undue competitive advantage in Germany and the Czech Republic. Notably, the deal also expands Vodafone's footprint in broadband, cable and mobile services in countries like Hungary and Romania.However, the antitrust agency doesn't see any negative impact of the deal in Romania and Hungary. The commission expects to give its verdict by May 2, 2019. Both Liberty Global and Vodafone expect the deal to get EU approval by mid-2019.The deal will help Liberty Global concentrate on smaller number of European markets where it can grow rapidly. Moreover, the deal will provide $12.7 billion (€10.6 billion) of estimated cash proceeds to the company that it will further invest in its core European assets.Post the completion of the divestiture, Liberty Global will be present in the United Kingdom and Ireland through Virgin Media. The company will have assets in Belgium, Switzerland, Poland and Slovakia. Liberty Global will also retain a 50% stake in VodafoneZiggo, a joint venture in the Netherlands.In the last reported quarter, U.K./Ireland revenue generating unit (RGU) additions were 105,000, up from 92,400 in the year-ago quarter. Continuing CEE (Poland, Slovakia and DTH) gained 17,200 RGUs compared with a loss of 4,900 in the year-ago quarter. However, the company lost RGU in Belgium and Switzerland. | For Vodafone, the transaction will expand its footprint in Europe. Upon completion of the deal the company will be able to offer fixed and mobile services in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. Vodafone will also be able to serve enterprises in the region.The deal will definitely boost Vodafone's competitive position against Deutsche Telekom in Germany. Moreover, it will be catapulted to the position of a cable giant in the fragmented market with infrastructure across Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the U.K. and other European countries.Moreover, the deal will not only strengthen Vodafone's presence in the major part of Europe but also provide cost synergies.Undoubtedly, once completed, the Liberty Global-Vodafone deal will change the European telecom scenario.

ommenting on the European Commission's probe into the $21.8 billion (£17.13 billion) Liberty Global deal,  recently said that it expects EU antitrust regulators to approve its purchase of some Liberty Global plc  assets in Germany and eastern Europe by mid-2019. The news was reported by Reuters.The Commission opened a full-scale enquiry into the deal as EU antitrust regulators think that it may reduce competition in Germany and the Czech Republic, offering monopolistic advantage to the merged firm.The deal would probably reduce competition in Germany in the retail fixed telecom markets and TV markets, limit investments in next-generation networks, while giving the combined entity more power as a TV broadcaster. The Commission further said that some competitors might be shut out of the Czech Republic market, where Vodafone offers primarily mobile telephony services and Liberty Global offers fixed services.The transaction between Vodafone and Liberty Global would enable the former to compete more effectively with Deutsche Telekom AG  in the German rival's home market. It would also expand Vodafone's reach in broadband, cable and mobile services elsewhere in Europe, leveraging Liberty Global's assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.However, the EU competition enforcer mentioned that it saw no issues in Romania and Hungary. It will decide whether or not to clear the transaction by May 2, 2019, though the deadline can be extended if Vodafone offers concessions. The company believes that the deal is on track for a green signal.Shares of Vodafone have lost 9.7% compared with a decline of 3.9% for the  in the past three months.Vodafone currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock in the industry is KT Corp.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (Symbol: SUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $127.66 per unit.With SUSA trading at a recent price near $113.52 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.46% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SUSA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), United Technologies Corp (Symbol: UTX), and Booking Holdings Inc (Symbol: BKNG). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $24.72/share, the average analyst target is 41.87% higher at $35.07/share. Similarly, UTX has 29.90% upside from the recent share price of $122.73 if the average analyst target price of $159.43/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BKNG to reach a target price of $2253.00/share, which is 20.52% above the recent price of $1869.45. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, UTX, and BKNG:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Anticipate 12% Gains Ahead For SUSA@2018-11-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-anticipate-12-gains-ahead-susa-2018-11-29
" recently signed an agreement with Paramount Players, a division of Viacom's Paramount Pictures Corporation, to sell film rights of popular toy brand - Creepy Crawler.The move reflects the company's strategy of collaborating with popular brands and movie franchisees to drive revenues amid a challenging U.S. toy industry. The agreement shows JAKKS Pacific's efforts to drive its toys' popularity. JAKKS Pacific is also connecting with customers through digital videos, display banners and social ads, which will improve customer experience. Digital innovation will facilitate brand building apart from helping the company to capitalize on the growing technology-based gaming market.The U.S. toy industry was dealt a heavy blow when the country's largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us, filed for bankruptcy last September. Since a considerable portion of the company's revenues were derived from sales to Toys ""R"" Us, the company's net revenues were affected. On a year-over-year basis, net revenues in the first and second quarter of 2018 declined a respective 1.4% and 11.5% due to the liquidation.Thus, the company focuses on entering into a deal for greater distribution of its iconic products to drive incremental sales. Its strategy to cultivate its digital capacities through partnerships is likely to enhance its earnings potential.Notably, JAKKS Pacific has entered into multiple licensing agreements for varied product lines since the beginning of 2017. The company has signed licensing agreements with popular movie and television franchises like Time Warner's Cartoon Network, Warner Bros., Sony Pictures and Universal Pictures. We expect such collaborations to boost sales as merchandise based on movies is much in demand.Moreover, the company has collaborations with Disney, Skechers, Nickelodeon, Cabbage Patch Kids and Chico to manufacture toys and merchandise related to these brands. In fact, the toys based on popular television shows and movies, large-scale figures based on action entertainment and pre-school toys are well-liked by kids and are expected to be major top-line drivers for the company.Meanwhile, shares of the company have risen 6%, underperforming the  's rally of 12.4% in the past six months.JAKKS Pacific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the  sector are DISH Network Corporation  and Liberty Global plc  , carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Caleres, Inc.  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .DISH Network has an expected current year earnings growth rate of 9.06%.Liberty Global has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 103.49%.Caleres has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 15.7%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.4, after changing hands as low as $22.01 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 29.0. A bullish investor could look at LBTYA's 29.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of LBTYA shares:    Looking at the chart above, LBTYA's low point in its 52 week range is $22.01 per share, with $39.73 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $22.09.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Liberty Global Shares Enters Oversold Territory (LBTYA)@2018-12-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/liberty-global-shares-enters-oversold-territory-lbtya-2018-12-19

"Chicago, IL -October 9, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  and  .U.S. stock markets opened the week on a broad down stroke, led by the Nasdaq index.The reasoning here? The higher that interest rates go, the worse the U.S. GDP growth rate becomes. The lower the GDP growth, the less the reason to buy tech stocks that can lead the market higher.And the same set of stocks have been momentum-trading for some time. Traders have been looking for a reason to take profits on the high-flying momentum stocks.Interest rates provided the best reason in a while. As October is usually a bright month for stock returns, it remains to be seen if Mr. Market turns things around in the second half.Below are Reuters in London's five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week. I have kept them in the order of importance to the equity market.U.S. bond yields have jumped in the wake of stunningly strong economic data and hints from Federal Reserve officials that interest rates could rise for a fourth time this year in December.That rate-hike cycle may be about to take another bite into the already softening U.S. housing market, as rising mortgage interest rates weaken home affordability.Mortgage application volumes are lower on a year-over-year basis and refinancing activity continues to decline - fewer borrowers can benefit, given today's higher interest rates.So, this week's data by the Mortgage Bankers Association on home loan applications will be closely scrutinized, after 10-year benchmark borrowing costs leapt to their highest since May 2011. If 10-year Treasury yields stay near their seven-year peaks, borrowing costs on U.S. 30-year mortgages would increase 10 to 15 basis points by the upcoming week, Freddie Mac's chief economist Sam Khater estimates.The divergence between depressed European stocks and their buoyant American counterparts seems to be here to stay.While some investors hope that a strong third-quarter earnings season on the old continent might revive a stock market stuck in negative territory, there is in fact little chance Europe will play catch-up.Third-quarter earnings for the pan-European STOXX 600 are expected to increase 13.9 percent from the third quarter of 2017, according to data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Sounds like a good quarter, right? But look at what is expected of the S&P500 - 21.5 percent earnings growth.Then contrast Europe's sluggish growth with the U.S. economy, which is not just firing on all cylinders but appears on the verge of overheating. German retail and manufacturing data shows Europe's biggest economy is likely to have lost steam over the summer. The U.S. manufacturing PMI meanwhile has surged to its highest since May.Difficult, therefore, to imagine how Europe could possibly catch up on the S&P's 16 percentage-point lead.Japanese stocks recently scaled 27-year highs as foreigners turned buyers of Tokyo-listed blue-chips. Improving growth, tentative wage inflation and ""Abenomics"" have all helped. But the rally's main driver has been yen weakness.As U.S. yields rose gradually to 3 percent while Japan seemed committed to its yield control policy, the yen seemed on track to fall towards 115 per dollar - a level last seen in early 2017 - and Japanese exporters looked a hot purchase. Now, though, the sell-off in U.S. Treasuries could end the Nikkei rally.Aside from surging U.S. yields, temperatures in the U.S.-China trade war are climbing further and when Chinese markets open on Monday after a week long-holiday, the yuan could play catch-up with other emerging currencies which are nursing heavy losses against the dollar.If all that conspires to send the yen higher, the Nikkei - already in some discomfort - could end up being crushed.Anti-EU and anti-euro rhetoric is rife these days in Italian politics, which is keeping investors' eyes trained on just how far Italy's stance can diverge from fellow EU members and what implications that would have for the single currency.With the bloc's third-largest economy due to present its budget to Brussels on Oct. 15, concerns over Italy's spending plans and what they mean for its position within the EU should dominate bond markets next week.""Quitaly"" fears reared their head briefly last week, sending the euro and Italian bonds lower. While it's calmed down on that front, combative comments from the government haven't stopped. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini is leading the charge, accusing top European Commissioners on Friday of wrecking Europe.He said his government aimed ""to change this Europe from the inside,"" however, implying there is no appetite yet to exit the bloc.Brazil is holding its most divisive election in decades and far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro looks set to take a commanding first-round lead. But he may still be short of votes to win the election outright; polls show him deadlocked with Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers Party.That makes a runoff vote on Oct. 28 likely.The election in Latin America's biggest economy comes at a testing time for emerging markets. A toxic cocktail of a strong dollar, rising borrowing costs and soaring  has hit emerging currencies, ramped up inflation pressures and forced countries into tightening policy at a time of slowing economic growth.Brazilian markets have risen in recent days on hopes Bolsanaro, if he wins, will promote an orthodox economic policy. But whomever wins Brazil's presidential race will inherit a fiscal straitjacket and an economy that only recently emerged from its deepest recession in decades.What's more, while reform is desperately needed, the new president is unlikely to have a governing coalition in Congress that could enable these to be passed. This is a $20.5B market-cap cable TV group. The long-term Zacks VGM score is B. Are groups like this going to turn it around against the ""cable cutters""? We shall see. This is a yoga apparel company that is on an impressive share price run. It remains to be seen if this momentum has overshot its mark. This sell-off will be telling. The Zacks Value score is F. This is the $7B market cap Japanese camera maker. Japanese stocks have been on a roll. Does this sell-off beat them up, or leave them alone? My guess is they enjoy some damage too. The long-term Zacks VGM score is A, though. This stock may be worth picking up, once the carnage is over. , Brazil's FGV consumer inflation rate came out. It was 10.33% y/y, and well above the +9.06% expected by the consensus. This is a sorry economy to manage, and the election may not help matters. , Mexico's CPI comes out. It is looking for +5.0% y/y. While not as bad as Brazil, this is still a high consumer inflation rate. , U.K. manufacturing production comes out. Look for a weak -0.2% m/m reading. The y/y reading is +1.1%. That's puny. Brexit is indeed starting to bite. , U.S. initial claims looked extremely low at 207K last week. This week should be similarly low. Maybe too low? As long-term interest rates are starting to bite, in anticipation of stepped up Fed tightening. , the University of Michigan sentiment index comes out. Look for another strong reading above 100.

" (NASDAQ: TIVO) can't get out of the digital TV recorder business fast enough. But with  (NASDAQ: AMZN) now reportedly developing its own DVR product to record live TV programming, TiVo's chances of finding an interested buyer have probably decreased dramatically.TiVo announced earlier this year that it will no longer make its set-top boxes, opting instead to contract out their manufacture to an unnamed third party. While it would still sell the TiVo-branded boxes on its website, and they would be available for purchase at Amazon and  , then-president and CEO Enrique Rodriguez said TiVo was exiting the hardware business and would instead act as a distribution channel. He also said TiVo was undertaking a strategic review with an eye toward selling the company.Image source: Getty Images.Rodriguez, however, didn't wait around to find out how the review would go, as he made his own exit in July. He jumped ship to cable giant  to serve as its chief technology officer, just eight months after having accepted the CEO job at TiVo. Board member Raghu Rau was appointed interim president and CEO.When TiVo announced its second-quarter earnings last month, it also said there might be buyers interested in its products, intellectual-property portfolio, and 22 million subscribers. But that was before Bloomberg said Amazon.com was  .Code-named ""Frank,"" the device would let TV viewers use the same technology that lets them connect to their Fire TV boxes through their Echo speakers and record live TV, something Amazon's existing boxes can't do.The DVRs would have physical storage and would be able to stream the video to a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or smart TV to watch at a later time, just like TiVo DVRs and the Slingboxes made by  ' (NASDAQ: DISH) Sling TV do. The difference is that Frank will connect to the device by a user's Wi-Fi signal, rather than than being plugged directly into the TV, making it more similar to the devices from TabloTV.The Bloomberg report didn't say whether the DVR capabilities would apply to content streamed from its Amazon Channels platform or would work only with broadcast channels, but Amazon is clearly angling to own your living room through connected devices such as its Fire TVs, TV boxes, and TV sticks.By horizontally and vertically controlling the entire TV process, Amazon.com can learn important information about your viewing habits and use the data to better market to you, in terms of both programming as well as through its retail platform. It's creating a complex ecosystem with strands that weave themselves into the fabric of your day and create a retail experience with numerous touchpoints to sell you something.Consumers don't have to leave their chair, let alone their home, to order products, food, services, or entertainment using Amazon's extensive catalog of technologies and services, and have it brought to their door or into their living rooms.A DVR is but a small cog in that enormous wheel, but keeping you from wandering beyond the comfort of its boundaries means Amazon.com can further dominate a market. That also has to be worrisome for TiVo, which has long survived on the strength of its patents, having used them in the past to wrangle licensing deals out of  and  giants that tried to move in on its turf.Now as TiVo tries to find someone to buy the company, it needs to persuade them that the value of its IP portfolio will be as strong as ever, as they will also have to take on the commerce giant at the same time.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Amazon wasn't one of them!

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (Symbol: EUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $65.63 per unit.With EUSA trading at a recent price near $59.57 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.17% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EUSA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LSXMA), (Symbol: LBTYA), and (Symbol: AR). Although LSXMA has traded at a recent price of $41.81/share, the average analyst target is 43.81% higher at $60.12/share. Similarly, LBTYA has 35.65% upside from the recent share price of $28.36 if the average analyst target price of $38.47/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AR to reach a target price of $23.45/share, which is 25.36% above the recent price of $18.71. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LSXMA, LBTYA, and AR:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Predict 10% Gains Ahead For EUSA@2018-09-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-predict-10-gains-ahead-eusa-2018-09-25
egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYA) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.8, after changing hands as low as $25.865 per share.

"nvestors in Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options begin trading this week, for the September 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new September 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $27.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $27.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $26.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $27.89/share today.Because the $27.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $27.89/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $30.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.90% if the stock gets called away at the September 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $30.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Two rivals - United Microelectronics Corp and Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co - had sought the injunction in retaliation for Micron suing the companies in U.S. district court alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and Taiwanese authorities indicted UMC and three of its employees on similar charges.

"nvestors in Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 15th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new June 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $29.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $31.92/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $31.92/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $32.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.58% if the stock gets called away at the June 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global plc - Class A Ordinary Shares, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $32.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $32.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (Symbol: IYC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $211.34 per unit.With IYC trading at a recent price near $180.86 per unit, that means that analysts see 16.85% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IYC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are GCI Liberty Inc (Symbol: GLIBA), (Symbol: LBTYA), and Liberty Media Corp - SiriusXM Group (Symbol: LSXMA). Although GLIBA has traded at a recent price of $51.08/share, the average analyst target is 48.79% higher at $76.00/share. Similarly, LBTYA has 38.22% upside from the recent share price of $30.77 if the average analyst target price of $42.53/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LSXMA to reach a target price of $55.14/share, which is 37.58% above the recent price of $40.08. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of GLIBA, LBTYA, and LSXMA:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Expect IYC Will Reach $211@2018-04-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-expect-iyc-will-reach-211-2018-04-16

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (Symbol: EUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $62.61 per unit.With EUSA trading at a recent price near $56.80 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.23% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EUSA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), Continental Resources Inc. (Symbol: CLR), and Sabre Corp (Symbol: SABR). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $32.96/share, the average analyst target is 29.04% higher at $42.53/share. Similarly, CLR has 19.59% upside from the recent share price of $52.72 if the average analyst target price of $63.05/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SABR to reach a target price of $25.20/share, which is 14.29% above the recent price of $22.05. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, CLR, and SABR:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

We have a lot to cover today and we always enjoy these opportunities to share with you what we've achieved, but I think more importantly, give you a sense of what we're up to today and where we're headed. I'm joined on the call by Charlie Bracken, our Chief Financial Officer, who's going to review our financial results, as he always does, along with a host of other senior execs from around the world who all asked to chime in on issues during the Q and A, as needed.We are going to speak from slides today. I hope you can grab a copy of those now or later. There's a lot of good data on there. I'm going to start on Slide 4 where we lay out a handful of operating and financial highlights for 2017, a year where we not only delivered some solid growth, but perhaps even more importantly from our perspective, laid the foundation for sustainable long-term operating success and value-creation for shareholders.Now, I'm going to run through some stats on the left-hand side. As we do every year, we expanded our fixed subscriber base, ending with 45.8 million video broadbanded voice RGUs, and that excludes mobile. It increased to 760,000 net RGUs year-over-year. And I'll break that number down by country in a moment, but the big takeaway for me and hopefully for you is continued improvement in video losses, which were 30% better in 2017 than 2016 and represented an almost two-fold improvement over two years ago. So it's clear that our ability to retain 99.5% of our video subs every year, whatever the number is, is directly correlated to the evolution of our video platform, our go-apps, our user interface, our footprint expansion. It's all working, from our point of view.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Liberty Global wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!On the financial front, rebased revenue growth was 2.3% for the full year, or $15 billion. That's up 3% in the fourth quarter alone, and that was our best revenue growth quarter in two years, driven in large part by the 4.5% revenue growth we experienced at Virgin Media.Rebased OCF growth was 4.5% for the full year, or $7.1 billion. And as we indicated the last time, the fourth quarter and the full year were impacted by Switzerland negatively and if you exclude that one market, our fourth quarter and full-year OCF growth would have been 6% in each period. And Charlie and I will dig into Switzerland in a couple slides here.Our capex or PP and E for the full year was $4.8 billion, or 31.7% of revenue. Again, you'll see how that breaks down in a few slides, but hopefully, it's clear to you that we are purposely investing capital into long-term, sustainable growth. This level of spend is not the new normal for us. Many of you have asked that question. And we are choosing to lean into our customers for all the right reasons, and we're been offensive and smart about our capital spend.So how are we doing that? I think, first, we're driving broadband capacity and quality of service across the platform. That's the most important thing we can do. We're opportunistically expanding the reach of our networks through high-return, new build projects. We've talked a lot about that. The new build projects alone represent about a quarter of our capex, so that's clearly a discretionary spend. We're making discretionary investments in new products like Horizon, and we're rolling out next-gen digital boxes and one-gig wifi routers at a record pace.And every quarter, we get deeper into fixed-mobile convergence, which we know drives turn down and drives NPS up. And then, perhaps most importantly, we're investing in the digital tools like advanced analytics, AI-based applications, better call center processes -- the things that we know will ensure we're retaining customers and growing ARPU.And then finally on this slide, on the right-hand side, you'll see that we continue to demonstrate what we believe is an unwavering commitment to value-creation for shareholders. Now, this might be what sets us apart the most. We promised to create a pure-play European platform. And with the spin-off of Latin America, we've now done that. We talked all year about rebalancing our business to focus on national scale. So trying to be an inch wide and a mile deep in our core markets. And the sale of Austria, obviously, is evidence of that strategy.We've talked about the disconnect between public and  values. Clearly, the multiple of 11 times in Austria helps make that point. And then lastly, our prudent approach to balance sheet management. The $5 billion of liquidity we have all support our levered equity growth model. The biggest piece of which, of course, is commitment to owning more of our stock. With $3 billion of buybacks completed last year, and another $2 billion already announced this year.So we remain focused on three key strategic goals. They should sound familiar to you. First, driving national scale through both smart rebalancing and footprint expansion. Second, investing in profitable customer growth through network and product innovation. And then third, optimizing our levered equity returns for the benefit of shareholders. That's a pretty strong combination, in our view.Now, on Slide 5, we start digging into our 2017 results in a bit more detail, beginning with subscriber growth. In the top left, you'll see it again that we've added 760,000 RGUs for the group, split almost equally between the first half and the second half with the primary difference being slightly higher video losses in Switzerland and Germany in the second half, and I'll address that. Virgin Media generated 336,000 net adds. That's up 34% over last year with pretty modest growth in the fourth quarter. The good news is that we were much more disciplined in the fourth quarter and strategic about discounting in order to retain ARPU, which clearly worked for us.Churn in the fourth quarter was also the lowest of the year. And rental ARPU is up sequentially as a result of the price increase and our discounting activities. That sets us up really well for continued growth in 2018.You'll see on the top right that we added 229,000 RGUs in Germany, which was slightly weighted to the second half of the year. We saw 40% sequential uptake in the second half for data voice adds, and that is not abnormal for us. That's pretty typical. But total net adds were impacted by increased video churn in the third and fourth quarter from the loss of an MBU contract, but also from the Analog Switch-off Initiative, which impacted churn. And we've got both of those things under control, as a matter of fact.On the bottom left, Central and Eastern Europe generated 266,000 new RGUs for the year, 70% of those in the second half as we added video subs, we turned things around in Poland, and we penetrated our new-build footprint. Telenet in Belgium lost 54,000 RGUs in the year, about the same in each period. And all of that -- almost all of that's related to open access. But as a reminder, there's a silver lining. Telenet largely breaks even economically on the access regime in Belgium, provided that for every Telenet sub we lose, Orange also adds a Proximus sub to their wholesale deal with us, and that's basically what's happening.Lastly, you'll see that the Swiss and Austrian business went from a positive 8000 net adds in the first half to a loss of 26,000 in the second half of the year. And as we've signaled and have been signaling for the last 6 to 12 months, the Swiss market has experienced some pretty intense competition in both fixed video and broadband. And like we did in the Netherlands, we're in the midst of transitioning and investing in our business with new sports services, smarter bundles, and a popular fixed mobile product.But I want to point out that Switzerland is really not Holland, from our perspective. There's some big differences. For starters, there's only three mobile operators there today, not four. And the challenger has an inferior network. And I think Swisscom is largely a rational competitor and has been for some time. We're in a strong position here across the footprint. We have a super-fast broadband network that reaches two-thirds of the market. By the way, we just doubled speeds this week for half our broadband sub-base in Switzerland. And on top of that, we have very high OCF and free cash flow margins, which presents some interesting strategic options for us, as we've discussed.Turning to Slide 6, as you know, we're in Year 3 of our Liberty Go Plan. And as we've done from time-to-time, we've highlighted here on this slide progress on a handful of those key drivers. We haven't included our new build initiative on this slide, which is arguably our largest source of future growth because I'll talk about Project Lightning in a minute. But we do talk about four other big drivers.I'll start with pricing, on the top left and the good news here is that we have been able to successfully take price increases across our footprint pretty much without exception. And in 2018 we've already announced price increases in most markets, including Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, and certain of our CEE countries. But on the other hand, as we've also communicated throughout the year, both competition and discounting have been impacting ARPU growth, especially in the UK and Switzerland. So while ARPU is up around 1% for the company as a whole, year-over-year, we were flat at Virgin Media for the year and down nearly 2% in Switzerland.Of course, the UK has turned the corner, as I've kind of indicated, and is back to ARPU growth, and I'll cover that in a minute. And Germany and Belgium were both up 3%. So it's a mixed story there, but one we continue to work on.Certainly, a bright spot for us has been B2B. On the top right, you can see some numbers there. We have completely hit the mark here, we believe, and continue to generate double-digit, topline growth with 13% growth in the fourth quarter. What's driving this? First of all, SOHO and SME, which now represent together just under 50% of our B2B revenue. They each grew 27% and 10%, respectively, last year. And there is still significant upside in market share across Europe.Two other quick observations. German B2B revenue growth was up 50% for the year, and that's mainly on the back of SOHO and SME. And Belgium, one of our most mature B2B businesses was up 21% in the year, as Telenet added an MVNO customer to the mobile business.Now, turning to mobile, there are, as usual, some headwinds that we're battling, but also some really encouraging trends. And I'll go back and forth on both. For the full year, revenue was down 1%. But the top line improved every quarter. So from a negative 8% in the first quarter to a positive 5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Mobile revenue in Germany, in Switzerland, in Central and Eastern Europe, where we have just launched, really, MVNOs, we're up 30 and 60%. And that's really, of course, from a low base and is organic.Virgin and Telenet, which account for 90% of our consolidated mobile revenue, were down around 1% and 7%, respectively last year. While they both added post-page subs, ARPU is impacted by competition and continued regulatory headwinds, as we've discussed. But Virgin had a strong fourth quarter with revenue up 17% on the back of higher handset sales and out of bundle usage. And both markets have some really positive drivers in 2018. Virgin in the UK will benefit from the transition to a new full MVNO with EE, which provides 4G, greater control over pricing and bundling and better economics, while Telenet will complete the migration of all mobile subs to the base platform and is going to generate the lion-share of synergies in that period. So good news in both cases.Finally, on the bottom right, we highlight the fact that we've executed very well on the efficiency plans that we set out for ourselves. I'm particularly proud of the fact that we finished another year with flat indirect costs, steady at $4.5 billion. And that's despite all of our new-build product and commercial activity through the year. Now, these are largely scale-based efficiencies around support function, central cost, and our T and I operating model. And as an example, you can see in the call-out box that most, or if not all, of those savings in central support functions were invested back into customers in terms of both products and marketing.So to recap, new build, cost efficiencies, and B2B are all contributing to growth. Mobile is showing some positive signs as we continue to migrate to truly converge services and better MVNO deals. And we're committed, perhaps more committed than ever, to ARPU growth, especially in the UK.Which is a great transition to the next slide, where we talk about some operating updates for Virgin Media, which is our largest, and as you know, our most valuable operating business. And it ended 2017 on a very strong note. First, let me address the announcement about Dana -- Dana Strong, who will be joining Comcast at the end of March. Listen, I can't say enough good things about Dana, who I've worked with for nearly two decades. And while we're certainly disappointed to see her leave, we all understand the motivation. Comcast is a great company, and after 18 years outside the US, I think Dana and her family are excited to get back to her home state.Over the last year -- I think this is most important -- she's done everything we've asked of her at Virgin Media. She's built a fantastic team of marketing and product executives. They've implemented the tools and processes we need to grow the base and the ARPU. And they've overseen an aggressive rollout of new products. You can see some of the teams good work on the top left of Slide 7, which shows the step-up in revenue from the 1 to 2% range through the first nine months of the year, to 4.4% in the fourth quarter and OCF growth increasing from 1% in Q1 to over 5% in Q4.At the same time, the mobile team on the ground has done some terrific work adding postpaid subs at a record clipping Q4. In fact, we doubled our market share of Apple products in that quarter. And also driving mobile churn down with 4G and SIMO offers. They're also, by the way, preparing Virgin for a full-on rollout of converged FMC products later this year. So when you add in continued improvement in Virgin's network and product quality, where broadband congestion has been addressed, where we've just rolled out a 350-MG product nationwide, you add to that V6 boxes being rolled out and 1-Gig wifi routers being rolled out at a record pace, and we think Virgin is in a really strong market position.And I'll end my remarks with a quick update on Project Lightning, our fiber-based new-build program in the UK. First of all, I'm really proud of the progress that we made through the course of 2017, especially on the construction front. It's night and day from where we were 12 to 15 months ago. We have a first-rate leadership team. We have much greater control over the pace and cost of the build at every level, from planning to working with contractors, to managing local authorities. And you can see that on the chart on the top-right. It really tells the story the best. We have now built and released 1 million homes from marketing, including 536,000 in 2017. That's up 70% from the prior year, and it was ramping in each quarter, as you can see. And we're not providing guidance for 2018, but I think it's fair to say that we like this general pace as we go into this year. And we're still targeting 4 million homes through the overall project timeframe.Now, our confidence in Project Lightning is due in no small part to the fact that we continue to perform well on the key KPIs that matter most. And you can see on the bottom-right that customer penetration rates are trending toward our longer-term goal 39%, and we're generally hitting 24% after one year, and 34% after 33 months. Also, ARPU is in line with our overall base ARPU after discounts, currently around 50 Pounds per month. And build cost -- importantly, build costs to date have been steady around the 650 Pound per premise mark, with some variance depending on whether we're doing infill or green field. And of course, that number will also vary going forward, depending on the start-up capex, but also depending on the timing of wayleaves. Remember that in the denominator of that 650 Pound per premise mark, we don't include another 10% of homes that we've built, but yet haven't yet released for marketing because of wayleaves. So that number, arguably, is a bit overstated, looking backwards.Now, many of you have asked for an example of project returns from Lighting. Now, on the bottom-left, we give you some data -- some high-level data, which should look familiar to you. Now, this assumes we never build another home in the UK and simply market to the 1 million premises already constructed and already released for marketing. Now, assuming we hit the 39% penetration number and the ARPU aligns with the existing base at 50 Pounds, those million homes would generate about 230 million Pounds of revenue. If we use a conservative range for an OCF contribution margin of 50 to 60%, we ought to generate annual OCF of between 115 to 140 million Pounds on that cohort. And then when you do the math, this should generate unlevered IRRs in the 25 to 30% range.So I think it's important to note that while in the short-term, as we build out new communities with this fiber-based infrastructure, our capex spending is rising, but over time, we expect to return to normalized capex levels, just as we start to really see the OCF growth profile increase. That's the nature of this project. Spending today for a reservoir of growth tomorrow. And so far that's what we're seeing, and you'll see that kick in in 2018.Now, I'll make one last point before handing it over to Charlie. There has been, as you've probably seen, some press speculation and even some announcements, about what we may or may not do going forward in Europe. And I'm not going to comment specifically on any of that. But I want to make one thing clear. We are not, quote/unquote, ""dismantling our European business,"" as one paper noted. Quite the contrary. In today's competitive world, scale matters more than ever. And we are committed to the core markets we're in, where we see a pathway to becoming a national champion.Now, consistent with this strategy, we have a pretty good track record of accretively rebalancing our business from time to time. Those who have been investors would know that. And that allows us to focus on what we do best, innovate, invest, compete, and build scale and grow. And the sale of Austria, UPC Austria, is really just the latest example of that.So Charlie, over to you. -- Thanks, Mike, and hi everyone. I will walk you through our full-year financial results and then provide some color on our segment performance and property and equipment additions. And then, finally, I will conclude with a high-level recap on our 2018 guidance targets.So I'm on Slide 10 now where we present our full-year financials. Now, in terms of our top line performance, which you can see on the upper left, we grew our rebased revenue by 2.3% to $15 billion last year. This included 3% growth in Q4, which was our best quarterly result in two years. And I will get into some of the key growth drivers on my next slide.On the OCF front, we regenerated rebased growth to 4.5% to $7 billion with our cost discipline continuing to be a key driver. And that's a point I will elaborate on later. Our 2017 P and E additions increased to $4.8 billion, or 31.7% of revenue as compared to $4 billion last year. And more on that in a minute, too.However, our increased new-build activity and our commitment to next-generation CPE were the main drivers for the year-over-year increases in both absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue. Moving to the bottom left of the slide, adjusted free cash flow was $1.6 billion in 2017. From a leveraged perspective, our consolidated adjusted gross and net debt ratios stood at 5.1 times and 4.9 times, respectively, at December 31st.We made great progress during 2017 with $24 billion of refinancings that extended our average tenant to nearly 8 years, while our blended, fully swapped borrowing cost was reduced to 4.2%. Finally, we repurchased $400 million of our stock in Q4, bringing our full-year total to $3 billion of buybacks.Turning to Slide 11 in our Segment Reporting, on the far left, we show our rebased growth for the overall company, including both our fourth quarter and full-year results. Moving to the right, to Virgin Media, our operations in the UK and Ireland posted rebased revenue growth of 4.4% and 2.1 in the Q4 and full-year periods, respectively. The Q4 result was our strongest quarterly performance in two years, supported by an improvement in our mobile business in large part driven by handset sales, as well as solid growth in B2B.As expected, in Q4, Virgin Media's ARPU grew 1% sequentially from Q3 as the November 2017 price increase took effect. Unity Media delivered 4.3% rebased revenue growth for the full-year, while rebased OCF grew 4.9%. Now, bear in mind that we switched off our analog signal in June and lost around $7 million of carriage fees in each of the third and fourth quarters, and we will have a similar headwind during the first half of 2018.In Belgium, Telenet posted 1% rebased revenue growth in post-Q4 and full-year 2017, mainly driven by strong results in B2B, in large part offset by mobile headwinds. Telenet's rebased OCF increased 6.1% in 2017, benefiting from the continued migration of legacy MVNO customers to our own mobile network.Moving to Switzerland and Austria, we reported relatively flat rebased revenue results in each of the fourth quarter and full-year periods. The 8% rebased OCF contraction that CHAT in Q4 was largely explained by increased content costs related to the launch of MySports in September last year, as well as competitive pressures. After considering the distribution fees that we receive from other cable operators, our MySports programming costs were approximately Swiss Francs 10 million in A4 and Swiss Francs 14 million in the second-half of 2017.And as we mentioned in our last earnings call, we expect the net expenses associated with MySports to be around 30 million Swiss Francs in 2018. And it's also worth noting that the Q1 and A4 impacts will be higher than the Q2 and Q3 periods, primarily due to the timing of the Swiss Ice Hockey schedule.Our Central and Eastern European segment posted 5% rebased revenue and OCF growth for the full-year, supported in part by new-build activities across the region. Rounding out our segments, we continue to streamline our cost base, reducing our central and corporate expenses by approximately 11% over the full-year period.And then finally, on this slide, taking a step back, the vast majority of our operations have been executing at a high level, with the outlier clearly being our business in Switzerland. And when we look at our results without the tracking system, we're pretty pleased with our performance.On Slide 12, we provide a bit more color on our P and E additions, which we categorize into five main buckets, CPE, rebuild and upgrade, capacity, product and enablers, and baseline expenditures. The key point that I will address is the level of our capital intensity, which stood at 31.7% for the full year of 2017. Prior to 2015, when our new build efforts began ramping, we were able to execute on our levered equity strategy by growing OCF with a lower capital intensity. More recently, and into 2018, the operational dynamic has shifted somewhat, as we have been increasingly investing in the customer experience while pursuing an expansive network expansion program. And this has been reflected in our increased capital intensity.As you can see from the tables, spend on new-build and upgrades increased by 24% in 2017 and represented nearly 8% of revenue. And as Mike illustrated earlier, we do believe that our new-build program is establishing a reservoir of future growth with meaningful contributions to OCF expected to begin this year.In the first line of the table, we detail our customer premise equipment category, or CPE. Growth in CPE of 27% was partly related to new-build volumes, but also reflects our decision to proactively increase penetration of next-generation platforms. Today, over 40% of our video and broadband basis have an advanced TV set, top-set, top-box, or a wifi-connect box, and we will continue to aggressively upgrade our customers in 2018.Similarly, we will continue to invest in our networks to ensure that our customers' experience first-class connectivity. We spent over $600 million on capacity investments to improve reliability and meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband data consumption.The next category is products and enablers, which increased 28% year-over-year. This spend allows us to develop enhanced functionality and a more robust product suite for both our residential and B2B customers. And then finally, we had a modest increase in our baseline capital spend, where we've been proactively choosing to accelerate certain investments in core areas of our infrastructure.So in conclusion, we continue to invest heavily across all P and E, or property and equipment classifications. But once our new-build program subsides, we would expect to see our capital intensity to fall back into the low 20% of sales.Slide 13 wraps things up. And to summarize, we are focused on continued subscriber, ARPU growth, and topline growth. We remain committed to new build and expect to see a much more meaningful OCF contribution this year and beyond. B2B continues to achieve double-digit revenue growth and we expect strong growth to continue in 2018. And from a cost perspective, we have delivered on our promise of keeping our indirect costs base flat.Our balance sheet, we will continue to term-out the average tenor of our debt, hedge both currency and interest rate risks, and maintain ample liquidity. And as Mike mentioned, we will analyze all scenarios where we can create shareholder value, most recently evidenced by the sale of UPC Austria at a very attractive multiple.So finally, moving toward 2018 guidance, we expect to generate around 5% rebased OCF growth this year, spend $5.1 billion on property and equipment additions, including $1.2 billion on a new-build and upgrade projects, deliver $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow, and repurchase another $2 billion of our equity in 2018.And with that, operator, we would like to turn it over for questions.The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you would like to ask a question, please do so by pressing the * or asterisk key followed by the digit 1 on your phone. In order to accommodate everyone, we request that you ask only question with one follow-up if needed. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We'll pause for just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to ready for questions.And we'll take our first question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. -- Morgan Stanley Thank you, good morning, guys. Mike, you talked about wanting to build to be a national champion in the markets you're in, and that's consistent with what you've said in the past. Can you talk about both Germany and Switzerland in that context, and what those paths look like in those markets? And related to just the asset sale idea, in general, maybe for Charlie, can you just talk a little bit about your tax assets and how you can or cannot tax efficiently, sell assets for cash. I don't know if you've talked about any tax leakage with Austria, for example, but just maybe remind us of your ability to, sort of, tax efficient on asset sales, particularly for cash, as you guys think through your portfolio. -- Sure, thanks, Ben. Look at, I have to be cautious here because we're not specifically addressing any particular market in what we may or may not be doing. But I think if you look at Austria as an example, we had roughly 35% reach in that market. We had a business that was, for quite some time, ex growth or low growth, but it's been doing slightly better recently. We had an MVNO deal that was pretty good, but a competitive mobile marketplace. And we felt that in that particular instance was going to be a tough path to becoming a national champion. And I'm not suggesting you go through every market, comb through the stats and then draw a conclusion.Germany, there's optionality there. We have a great business. It's been, for us, a home run investment just on any economic basis. And we have, we think, a company that continues to grow steadily and with a broadband market that's extremely exciting, and continues to be, and a great, great management team. So I don't want to be specific about any particular market, Ben. It's a bit awkward for us. But I think that for whatever we do in that particular instance, it's a market we ought to grow with or look at options.In Switzerland, I've said before, we have greater reach there, almost two-thirds, coming up on 70% of the market. I think it's a market that is probably screaming for rationalization on some level. Certainly, there are some options there for us to consolidate and/or become a larger player in that particular marketplace.We've got challenges. I mean, Charlie mentioned them. I mentioned them in my remarks. It's a market that will continue to have some issues in the next year. I want people to know that. We don't expect a rapid turnaround in the Swiss market, just as we didn't get a rapid turnaround in Holland. It took us a couple, three years, to really get the fixed business in Holland back on track, which it is today, as you look at the VodafoneZiggo results. So I think we're being opportunistic and thoughtful about that, and I'm trying to dance around your question as I should in this context.Charlie, you want to hit the taxes? Charlie, you might be on mute. -- Yeah, I think we have, as you know -- oh, sorry. Can you hear me now? -- Morgan Stanley Yeah. -- Yep. -- I think we have a very substantial tax asset. -- Morgan Stanley Okay. That cut out clear enough. -- Yeah. No, sorry. I'll be more specific than that. I think he may have cut off. Clearly, as you would imagine, Ben, we are all the time evaluating our tax posture with respect to all of our businesses. And we plan for many eventualities and we plan for the long-term. And I would say that we have a very efficient tax structure. I'd leave it at that. I think you can -- -- Morgan Stanley Okay. Yeah. -- -- you'll see through what we mean by that. -- Morgan Stanley Yeah, sure. Helpful. Thank you both. -- You got it. Yep.We'll take our next question from Nick Lyall with Societe Generale.Hello to everybody. Just, now, a couple please, if possible. Just the first one on the UK ARPU, please. I'm still a little bit confused why it was down 0.6% year-on-year. Is there anything I've missed in there in terms of discounts or maybe a shift in mix of the people you're bringing on into the business? And then secondly, just very quickly, the overall question on fixed and mobile. You sound very convinced on fixed-mobile convergence. But just looking at the Telenet business so far, and also VodafoneZiggo, the result is, like, a little mixed with tone nature being up, and also the OCF being really quite sharply down at VodafoneZiggo. So why are you so convinced given the performance of the businesses so far? Again, is there something I'm maybe missing? Thank you. -- Sure, sure. Tom, I think you're on. You might want to address the ARPU question. In principle, however though, as you'll remember, in the first quarter of last year is when we really started managing through some heavy churn related to the price increase toward the end of the year. And so the results at year-end, which is what this is measuring year-over-year, wouldn't have reflected the first quarter's experience around churn and discounting in that business. And as you may know, we've talked about, our average discount rate in the fourth quarter of this year -- last year -- was about 22%, whereas a year ago, it was 29%.So I think we've just been mostly focused on being particularly disciplined about the front book and how we actually -- and the back book -- and how we actually maintain ARPU. And that's probably what you saw in the fourth quarter around net adds. And churn was better in the fourth quarter, but sales were also a little bit down as we became more disciplined around the ARPU line. So I think Charlie mentioned that we had sequential ARPU growth. I think you'll continue to see that. But year-over-year, it's just a matter of when you're measuring those two numbers. Do you want to add to that at all, Tom?Yeah. Just thank you. I'd just add that maybe the estimate there of the year-on-year decline was a bit overstated. Remember, a year ago, we actually had two concentrated price rises, so we were coming off a particular high. In this period, as Mike's mentioned, we feel we've managed it significantly better. We were always going to see that difference in Q1 of this year rather than Q4 of last year because as we said on the deck, there's only a half a quarter's price rise, and it's pretty much a nominal increase in that first period. So it's really an issue about how we're performing through this Q1 period and through that whole range of actions that Mike's mentioned about a more structured approach to discounting, about the V6 EOS boxes being deployed, about better routers, about better base management overall. We are in significantly better shape than we were 12 months ago. -- To your mobile question, it depends on what you're measuring. Right? In both Telenet and particularly in VodafoneZiggo, we have seen the sort of improvement that gives us confidence, and in particular, I'm referring to NPS and churn. If your NPS spikes, which it has in the case of Holland, for example, then your churn declines, which it has there, as well, as you combine and bundle customers across fixed and mobile, that is a really encouraging trend for the long-term. And remember, fixed and mobile for us in Europe, it's partly offensive because we know customers want more and more products from us. And in the case of markets where we have MVNO services, we're a challenger, and we're growing revenues 20, 30, 40% as we enter markets with mobile.There's also some defense involved, as there should be because our competitors, mostly the incumbent telcos are also converging. And so we have to be responsive to the market, and in knowing that fixed-mobile convergence is inevitable on some level. It varies by market. Some are far more converged than others, of course. But in the end, we want to be in that business and we want to be in it profitably. And I think we have the ability to do that in just about every market we're in.There are headwinds in the mobile business. We've talked about them endlessly. And there are some tailwinds, as we've seen. Both with synergies and with things like Wego in Belgium, which is clearly improving all sorts of metrics across that relatively small, today, mobile base. So I've described it as being quote/unquote, ""in transition."" As we look out over the long-term, we know that being in the fixed-mobile space makes a lot of sense for us, either through an MVNO or and MNO relationship, the latter coming with massive synergies, the former coming with reasonably good economics and the opportunity to be a challenger. So that's how we'd describe it.Great. Thank you. -- You got it.We'll take our next question from Michael Bishop with Goldman Sachs.Yes, hi there. Just two quick questions for me. Firstly, just picking up on the capex points that you usefully pointed out and spit out in the presentation. If I, sort of, look at it another way and I take out the new-build from the $5.1 billion, it implies about 24% capex to sales. So I was wondering, is there anything else that's, sort of, exceptional one-off in that, and whether we could see the underlying rate fall further toward 20%. We actually had a pretty similar debate on the Telenet call about the future level, as well.And then secondly, given your 5% OCF growth guidance for the full-year, accordingly the UK is going to be a driver of that. So I was just wondering if you could help us better understand where you're thinking the contribution from Project Lighting will shake-out in '18 given your comments that that didn't really contribute at all in '17. Thanks very much. -- Yeah, on the capex point, I think Charlie should be back on. I'll just add one thing and then let him address it more specifically.He's not back on. -- Yeah, great. So, I mean, and one thing I would add that is happening both last year and should happen this year and contribute to incremental capex beyond what we would consider normalized capex, are things like what we're doing in the UK with the V6 box rollout. So we had a million toward the end of last year. I think we're budgeting a million-and-a-half or more this year. So we are proactively, both with our EOS box, or our upgraded 4K, super-fast video platform, as well as with our Connect Box, so the new routers that provide a Gig of speed in the home. Both those sorts of CPE, for us, are really powerful tools to retain customers and grow customers. So we are, I would say, leaning into that CPE business a little bit more than we might otherwise.My view long-term is we do trend back down to the low 20s if you were to exclude all of that. And that's, kind of, where we were before we started new-build. But the one thing beyond new-build that we are leaning into, as I kind of indicated, was to get these devices in the home, we know NPS is up, like, 20 points when we put a V6 box in somebody's house. That's good capital spend. Any other color on that, Charlie? -- Yeah. The two other things I would say, I think Telenet taught us that project dial-in to investments and customer experience, IT, which is a front-loaded investment, as well as their investment in the mobile phone network of base, which I'm sure they explained to you that that is a front-loaded investment. The other big numbers is, as you saw, is in product. We're investing a lot of money in products. And that's good capital. We're putting a lot of money to B2B, to conserve  is frontloaded. And quite a bit again to what we call enablers, which is global digitalization of the customer experience, which we think will pay back very richly.So I do think this year has got a lot of, as you said, one-offs in it. The last comment, Mike, [00:43:40] you threw out a number of 24%. I wouldn't go about that the CPE growth is also, as Mike said, to do with the V6 boxes. But it's actually also to do with new-build volumes, which it definitely -- I mean, that's part of the new-build spend, if you like. So it's not quite so clear that the new-build we're talking about on the slide is pure to the access network investment. -- Yeah, great point. Great point. Yeah. And on the Lightning question in the UK, we're really not providing any detailed guidance around either Lightning or the UK, except to say, sort of, anecdotally that the contribution in '18 will be materially higher than it was in '17, as you would expect because we're scaling through some of those start-up costs. We have now a million homes to market aggressively. And I think we're much better and more efficient at that process. So it should be a meaningfully larger contribution in '18 than '17. But we're not going to give you any specifics. -- Just to give you some color on that, as Mike brought up, the faster we can grow that start-up base, ironically, the more EBITDA we lose because obviously, we'd need to start acquisition costs. So in some respects, one of the reasons we don't have any guidance is because it will take -- we want to grow as fast as we can, but that obviously will have a big impact to the profitability. But just exactly what he's saying, is genuinely accelerating in terms of new asset and profitability.Great. Thanks so much.And we'll take our next question from Robert Grindle with Deutsche Bank.Yeah, hi there. Thank you. In terms of the Project Lightning question, you're obviously gaining traction in the market and in the UK, and you have retreated to 4 million homes target. I wonder how you feel about the new entrance to fiber rollout in the UK. Obviously, you guys are well ahead of the game, and they'll be slow to get going. But is there either an opportunity to help on the costs of Project Lightning by sharing? Or is there an incremental opportunity beyond your original plan by leveraging off some of the other operator's build programs. Thank you. -- That's a really good question. I'll let Tom address what's happening, really, on the ground. I'll simply say that you're correct. We do have a head start. We've been building for over two-and-a-half years, now coming on three years. We have been through the challenges, as we all know on the call, but also responded very, very aggressively and positively to those challenges, and feel today that we've, kind of, nailed it. You know, we know exactly what it costs, how to build efficiently, how to get it done, and how to market in the wake of that build. So we do feel like we have a big head start. And I think that a lot of the activity you see today in the fiber announcements, I would describe them as -- not necessarily projects since most of them haven't really begun much -- is partially tactical, partially politically, partially also strategic.So you correctly point out that some of these announcements might create cooperation of collaboration for us or others who are looking to reduce costs and be more efficient. We'll see. It's a lot of capital. We know we've got the capital. We know we've got the rate of return. We're showing it to you. We know we've got both the inclination and the conviction around it. I don't know whether the rest of them will have the capital, the conviction when push comes to shove. So it does feel like we are way out in front. And it does feel to me like there could very well be opportunities to make our project even that much better.Tom, do you want to add some color to that?The only thing I'd add is that today, this moment, we've got over 500 crews out there averaging six people on a pretty wet and drizzly day actually making it happen. And as Mike alluded to, we've learned some lessons, maybe the hard way. But under  and with the cooperation of the core technology and innovation group across Liberty Global, we've really reorganized ourselves and we are much, much more confident about our ability to execute. And if other people see the opportunity to compete with BT, net-net, that probably helps us. -- Next question, operator.Next question comes from Daniel Morris with Barclays.Yes, morning. Thanks for taking the question. I've got one with a follow-up. I just wondered if you could talk more top-down on your ability to take price in the market. I mean, obviously, specifically looking at Germany. That's the market where '18 is going to be quite substantially smaller in terms of price increases versus '17, and that versus '16, as well. And maybe also you can also talk a bit more conversely in the UK, I think maybe the direction of travel is a bit different, that we could actually see year-on-year ARPU growth again in '18. So how do you think about your ability to take price in the market, generally? And then I've got a bit of a follow-up. Thanks. -- Well, I mean, as I mentioned in my remarks, we did execute price increases in 2017 pretty much across every market. It wasn't necessarily across every sub in every market but it was across every market, and generally, they range from 2 to 4%, 2 to 5%. In 2018, we've either already announced price increases or intend to in, again, pretty much every market, most of those kicking in, I would say, in the April to March timeframe. And really, the UK is the only one that, sort of, we're benefiting from in the first and certainly all of the second quarter because it was a Q4 price increase. And so we're, like our peers in these markets, we are, where we can, being I would say, optimizing the price-value relationship for customers. And I don't see that changing materially.What we have to do a better job of, and what I think we have been doing a much better job of is retaining as much of that price increase as possible because, clearly, as we learned a year ago -- and it was over a year ago now -- the price increases we do take ultimately have an impact on both churn and discounting, and you've got to have the tools, the right processes, the right people, the right incentives to both retain and manage that base once you take those price increases, especially in large markets like the UK. I feel really good about our ability to do that today. And that's a good segue to the ARPU question, Tom. You want to hit that -- in '18?Yeah. I've got, clearly, all the issues you have alluded to are going to play out. And as I said earlier, we think we are in a much better position, and we are operating in a much better position than we were 12 months ago with a new team in there and a new structure.Another thing I would point out going forward is the PL rights deal, which has come through. I know it's not complete yet, but potentially overall lower, certainly no higher than it was beforehand. That's going to give us a cycle of three years where we don't have the cost pressures from football rights driving a nominal price rise is just a pass-through from our point of view. So that should give us an opportunity to take price rise where we actually can retain a share of that outcome.That's helpful color. Thanks. I think you've, kind of, partially answered the second half of the question, which was very much that if we look mechanically, the price tailwind in Germany and the UK, your two key markets, looks like it's smaller in '18 versus '17, but your OCF growth guidance is stablish and Charlie already mentioned that there's a possibility that actually Lightning isn't a big tailwind if you're successful, ironically. So I was trying to just understand how you get to a stable OCF growth. But I think you've partly answered that. I don't know if there's anything to add. -- Well, I think there's a -- I'll give you a bit more color on the guidance. Clearly, if we're staying around 5%, that would include a range. You can decide what the range is. Our full-year results in '17 would have been closer to the lower end of that range. So obviously, we believe there's a very good chance we're at or above the mid-point of that range. And so I would suggest to you that the trend we see for our business in '18 is up. But we are also being cautious because there are headwinds.And one headwind, in particular, is our Swiss market. As I indicated just moments ago, we don't anticipate a massive turnaround in Switzerland. We have sports cost, and we're in the investment phase in a number of areas of that business, and so we're being conservative there. If you took Switzerland out of our results in '17, we would have been at 6% or higher in the fourth quarter.So clearly, we understand the moving parts of our business, but as we aggregate everything, there are always going to be headwinds. And we want to be transparent about those headwinds, but they might impact the overall results, it's not necessarily something that is reflective of our aggregate business, but as we've had in the past, whether it was Holland or some of you may remember Romania, sometimes with 12 countries, somebody catches a cold. So we want to be transparent about that.Very helpful. Thank you.I'll take our next question from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.First, the UK RG result this quarter, how much of that's related to price-hike churn versus backing off aggressive promotional activity? And then assuming you continue with these strategies, is it fair to assume, despite the benefit of Project Lightning, that your UK and net new RG use are probably going to be lower in '08 than '07, although, obviously, you'll have a higher quality customer and better ARPU trends? And then I've got a follow-up. -- Well, I would say, and again, I'll let Tom provide some color here -- the fourth quarter was a function of a number of things. But as I, kind of, indicated earlier, Jeff, it was really discipline around discounting. And our average discount was meaningfully below the discount a year ago. So year-over-year, that explains quite a bit of it. The other thing I would suggest to you is churn was down in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. But also sales were down a little bit as we were careful and disciplined about marketing and sales expenditures, as well.So I don't personally believe, and Tom I'm sure will agree, that fourth quarter is necessarily an indication of how we're trending. And consistent with what I just said a moment ago about the overall business and how we see it trending in '18, and I would suggest to you that that applies to the UK as well almost across all metrics.Alright, fair enough. And then Mike, can you comment on press speculation in the UK, you may have been on 5G? And if that's something that might be interesting, how are things different today than, say, compared to your experience in Chile with building out your own network? Thanks. -- Well, there have been some rumors around that. I would simply say that to the extent we were looking at that, it would be really optionality, Jeff, as opposed to something more strategic where we would be, as we did in Chile, looking to spend all of the capital to build a competitive network. I don't see us doing that in the UK. I wouldn't consider -- I wouldn't look at it in that light.Great. Thank you very much.And we'll take our next question from BJ Giant.Thanks. Mike, obviously, you guys are making a lot of investments with high-end boxes, faster broadband speeds, and you keep talking about you're really focused on driving ARPU. Can you give us some sort of sense on how the ROIs are sort of developing on these advanced advantages that you have? Because when you look at aggregate numbers, we see more capex, and we don't see the ARPU rising the way you would think.So at the unit level, any color? Because there's obviously a question about will customers pay up for these advanced services broadly? And any experiences you could share would be great. -- Yeah, well, I'll say that the largest part of our increased capital profile is, of course, new build and upgrade. And we do know, as we showed you in the case, in the slides, that that is a very high return on an unlevered basis. So it may be the highest return investment we're making. It is the highest return investment we're making today. So the vast majority of this incremental capital that we're describing here and talking about is rigorously examined, and constantly evaluated, and must come through a gauntlet of Charlie's team to ensure there's a rate of return on it that's acceptable to us. So hopefully you take some comfort in that.The smaller piece of the incremental capital that might be related to V6 boxes or connect boxes, I'll simply say that we're careful about how we roll those out. It's not indiscriminate. We generally are focused on customers that generate high ARPU for us. And we know that when NPS spikes and churn goes down, a happy customer is a profitable customer. So that's more anecdotal than detailed, and I'm not going to share any specific product economics with you around that. But if we weren't seeing an NPS spike, if we weren't seeing a churn reduction, that would suggest to you that maybe we aren't -- maybe we should be backing off that. But we are seeing the opposite. And just intuitively, if not financially, that's smart capital.And just on DOCSIS 3.1 rollout across the footprint, any update on faster speeds? Is that also generating excess returns? -- Well, you mean the return on our capacity spend.Yeah. -- Historically, if you look at the pace, or the rate at which consumption has been increasing 20 to 30%, and the rate at which broadband speeds that we deliver have been increasing, say, 20 to 30%, there is a correlation between speed and consumption. And generally speaking, whenever possible, our higher-end customers are paying us more. And if you look at the game -- the business that we're in, which is competing with incumbents and staying superior to incumbents in most instances, that model has worked for us historically.In terms of breaking down exact capacity spend to return, I mean, I'm not going to do that for you on the call here, except to say that we look at that spend very rigorously, too. And we're always optimizing the capacity in relation to usage and speeds and consumption. On DOCSIS 3.1, we are darn near all the way there in terms of having our entire footprint gigabit ready with 3.1. I think we reported last year, we were about 75 -- 80% ready. I think that'll grow to 90-some-odd% this year. And the expenditure to bring that network up to 3.1-ready has not been material. The only cost we'll really incur down the road, BJ, is for new 3.1 modems. And of course, we'll do that when we're ready. And we'll do that in the most economic way possible.And to your point, we won't just roll out a 3.1 modem indiscriminately. We'll roll it out to customers that pay us more for the higher speeds and the better services.Great. Thanks so much.And we'll take our next question from Matthew Harrigan with Buckingham Research.Oh, thank you. I was curious, you didn't talk really about the emerging European telecoms' framework. Aetna has really come out and said that so much of the profits in the new digital economy are basically being allocated to Facebook, Google, etc., and at the same time, you had that interesting consultancy study a few months ago from Arthur D. Little, really talking about numbers that were just large in a macroeconomic context, even for Europe. How do you see the field moving over there so that your growth could even accelerate as you capture more of your fair share of the innovation in the digital economy? -- Well, I think the framework in Europe is evolving. As we've said many times over the last decade, it's really been very favorable to us, the challenger, allowing for consolidation and stimulating investment, and I would say benefiting and rewarding those who invest and innovate quickly in markets. And the consumer's been the beneficiary, I think. So the last ten years have been very favorable. We're in an interesting moment here. We've talked about this publicly. It's an interesting inflection point. You have the commission that, I would argue, is looking to advance the framework exactly as it was, for the most part, which is incenting investment, encouraging investment, and ensuring that there's a rate of return for all players in the ecosystem.There are some political winds that are brewing around national regulators, in particular, who'd like to get more control over how you define market dominance, significant market power. And we're all scrambling a bit to ensure that the right outcome occurs. It will be some time, Matt. It'll be probably this summer before any resolution, and maybe even summer '19 before there's any real implementation of a new plan. My instinct is, it's not going to discourage investment. It's not going to discourage competition. It's not going to be something that we have to be too concerned about.The European Union, as you have already, kind of, highlighted, is much more, in my opinion, rational and balanced about the actors in this business. And in particular, it has a healthy view of digital platforms and wants to ensure that there's fairness in terms of both their contribution to taxes and employment, as well as what they're doing to disrupt existing businesses. I'm not suggesting they're swayed one way or the other, I'm simply saying that they have a healthy view of how that should evolve, and I feel good about in principle. We have to do our work. We've got to keep making the case, as do our peers. But I think in principle, the European market has historically been reasonable and rational and I suspect it will continue to be so.Do you have a personal reaction to the IOT numbers and aspects like that from that Arthur D. Little report? Because, I mean, they were just absolutely blue sky numbers. I mean, if you got even a small percentage of it, it would be integral to your business. And I know that we're talking  . -- Well, that's another -- yeah. It's a very good point. I think that the IOT business, as it evolves, and it'll take some time, is going to benefit all players in the market. If you're in the mobile business, clearly, a lot of the applications will be applications that are low bandwidth, that don't require a lot of capacity but require ubiquitous coverage. So that's a positive for us. But also if you're in the fixed business, those applications that require more bandwidth, having fiber as we do throughout these markets is going to be a huge advantage for us as 5G becomes more prevalent and as these applications develop.It's early days. I think if you ask anybody, even Vittorio, to Randall Stephenson, to Brian Roberts, it's early days for everybody in the IOT space, and it's largely application-driven. So it doesn't mean it won't be interesting, and it doesn't mean we won't benefit from it. I just think it's too early to say, you know, here's how we're budgeting revenue and here's how we're spending capital. I think over the next 24 to 36 months, some of that might be clear to folks.Not in the '18 budget. Thanks, Mike. -- You got it. Okay, I think, is that our last question?And the last question -- -- Okay, go ahead operator.We have one final question from James Ratzer with New Street Research.Yes, thank you very much, indeed. So this is kind of a last question. I was wondering if I could just come back to the issue around UK ARPU, please. I know we have the price rise in for six weeks of the quarter. You've also talked, Mike, about doing less discounting in the quarter, but yet the year-on-year ARPU trends actually didn't really seem to improve. It's still down, I think, about 0.4% year-on-year. So just interested in digging in a bit more on what's happening here. Is there something more, maybe, fundamental that UK consumers are just getting more price savvy and sensitive and it's just going to be tougher to push through ARPU due to mixed effect of spin-down? And secondly, just a -- sorry, Mike. Go ahead. -- No, you go ahead and ask the second question. It's fine.Yeah. And it segues also to how the UK, but on a slightly different topic, coming the Vodafone press release made it clear you're in discussions on the continental European assets only. So if you can comment at all, I'd just be interested in why the UK assets aren't part of your negotiations with Vodafone at this time. -- Well, I can't comment on the second question. Maybe they will, but we're not going to. On the first question, the main point here -- and Tom, I'll ask you to jump in -- the main point is, when you're looking at year-over-year, so let's say December 31 to December 31, that's ignoring the path of travel throughout the year. So as you may recall, we had some ARPU erosion last year, sequential. And the important point I think in ARPU is to look at sequential ARPU, James. And between Q4 and Q3 and between, certainly, Q1 and Q4, you want to be looking for sequential ARPU growth, which we didn't have. We had some challenges last year, as we went through and talked about quite a bit, the year-over-year number isn't the most important one. It's way are we coming from in the last two quarters, as I would say.Tom, you want to add to that?Yeah, no. I'd reinforce the point -- I think it's about Q1 '18. The issue is where we had the particular pressure last year. We're just going to have to prove ourselves to you in three months' time when we come to this earnings call that we have a much better team, effectiveness, systems, and organization, and discipline around that.You'd be hopeful of more -- further sequential ARPU growth going into Q1 next year, or this year, I should say.I don't think I meant to say that. I'll just say that we are -- we certainly feel that we are much better organized around the price increase. As we've mentioned, if anything, we took some pain on volume in Q4 in order to defend the ARPU. And in combination, we have better systems, frankly, better people, a better commitment around that.And you're not seeing, then, just to kind of follow-up here from the last question, any kind of general pressure around discounted having more, kind of, favor with consumers as the economic climate in the UK bites at all?I think in the broad, that's less of an issue for Virgin Media than it is for some of the other operators. We're clearly the highest ARPU operator in this market. And if anything, that position is widening. We avoid the heavily discounted piece of the market there on the bottom, essentially because that's not our product. That's a BT open-range product that other people sell. So I think in our position in the market about primarily being a triple-play operator, about being the fastest, most effective provider, having the best router, frankly, we think now the best Tivo V6 box to support that -- we sustain the highest ARPU. So we really, we continue to focus on ARPU accretion as a positive thing for the business.Great. Tom and Mike, thank you. Very clear. -- Sure. Thanks, guys. Alright, we appreciate everybody joining the call. Sorry we went over just a little bit. Look forward to talking to you on our first quarter results in a few months, as Tom said. We remain focused on the few things that I talked about up front. Right? Driving national scale wherever we can, investing in profitable customer growth, and that really means putting money into our networks and our products, or smart money. And then optimizing levered equity turns for you guys. So we think that's a strong combination, and we'll speak to you in a few months. Thanks very much.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Liberty Global's Full-Year 2017 Investor Call.

tocks put together a third straight day of advances on Tuesday as it tries to climb out of the hole that was dug in the previous two weeks. The major indices fought back from a soft morning to finish modestly higher though well below the 1%+ gains on Friday and Monday. Still, every little bit counts in a market that is still reeling from the sharp pullback and hoping that the worst is over.The NASDAQ got back above 7000 today with an increase of 0.45% to 7,013.5. The S&P advanced 0.26% to 2662.9 and the Dow was up 0.16% to 24,640.5. These indices are still approximately 7% off of recent highs from just a few weeks ago, though that's improved from the 10% deficits seen last Thursday. said Jeremy in Counterstrike.Speaking of  , the market calmed down enough for the editor to add a new position and more allocation to an existing one. Meanwhile, Brian Bolan has been selling a lot in his portfolios recently, but today he added one back to  and  each. Finally,  replaced five positions and banked three profits. Give it all a look below: Now that the market has calmed down a bit, Jeremy is feeling better about making some portfolio moves. On Tuesday, he added W.W. Grainger (GWW), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) supplier of facilities maintenance products. The company recently reported a strong quarter, including a 35% earnings beat and a sharply higher guidance. The pullback gives the portfolio a good entry for a stock that has just recently been much higher...and should be again. It was bought with a 13% allocation. Jeremy also added 5% to his allocation in IDEXX Labs (IDXX), which entered the portfolio earlier this month and should drift higher with further market stability. Read the full write-up for more on this new buy, including a look at its chart. Shares of J.Jill (JILL) really bottomed out a few months back, but Brian Bolan is seeing signs that this specialty retailer of women's apparel is turning things around. For example, a firm recently raised its price target on the stock and there has been some insider buying of late. Plus, JILL is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 40% in its latest quarter. The editor feels that he's getting a good name at a good price. Read the full write-up for more. The cybersecurity names have held up really well in this pullback, so Brian Bolan decided to pick a name from this space for his next buy. Qualys (QLYS) provides cloud security and compliance solutions to protect organizations from cyber-attacks and other risks. Last night, the company reported a beat-and-raise quarter, which suggests that it could be set up for a post-earnings drift higher. It also has a great history of consistently beating quarterly earnings estimates. The editor thinks this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is all set for a boost in rank.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14,  . The company is a leading cable TV operator in Europe and Latin America.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at a loss of $2.71, indicating a year-over-year decline of 210.6%.The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the previous four quarters while surpassed it last quarter. It delivered a negative earnings surprise of 95.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Liberty Global continues to grow in the Europe and Central America through several mergers and acquisitions and is looking for more takeover options to expand its footprint. Launch of Telenet Innovation Center will help the company create and test new products focused on new mobile technologies. Liberty Global has launched a new customer-friendly app, Connect App. Apart from the joint venture with Vodafone  in Netherlands, launch of DOCSIS 3.1 network services, the long-term agreement with Netflix  , buyout of UTV Ireland TV stations from ITV and the takeover of Cable & Wireless are anticipated to drive growth.Meanwhile, the company's share repurchases look encouraging. On Dec 18, 2017, the board of directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program. Notably, the stock buybacks were supported by the company's strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. The company is likely to maintain the flexible liquidity scenario in the upcoming quarters.Further, sale of Swiss and Austrian cable businesses is part of the company's efforts to restructure business. Liberty Global has inked a deal to sell its Austrian cable business - UPC Austria - to T-Mobile Austria for 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion). Several analysts opine that the sale might pave the way for a new $175 billion merger of Liberty Global with Vodafone Group.Backed by such tailwinds, share price of Liberty Global has rallied 17.7%, outperforming the  's growth of 2.0% in the past three months.However, Liberty Global's predominant operation in Europe is a major concern because of the prevalence of recessionary pressure, debt crisis and low per capita income in several European countries. Additionally, the markets for video, broadband, fixed-line telephony and mobile services are highly competitive and fast evolving with technological advancements and innovation. Hence, to keep pace with changing dynamics, the company has to bear the related expenses of launching the latest technologies.Liberty Global's top line and EBITDA growth might become volatile in the near future, or may be hurt by the maturing Western European operations that account for the majority of the company's total revenues.Further, owing to its presence in 14 countries outside the U.S., the company remains exposed to foreign exchange rate risks. Moreover, its recent acquisitions may certainly give rise to integration risks.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. Liberty Global has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $2.71. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | AMC Entertainment  from the  has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017 when it reports on Mar 1.

In fact, the onus fell on this segment to offer a smooth ride with the company's primary cash cow, ESPN, struggling. Now the question lingering in the investors mind is that whether the Parks & Resorts segment can sustain its good run in first-quarter fiscal 2018, when Disney reports on Feb 6.Disney's Parks & Resorts division, which has done exceptionally well in fiscal 2017, is likely to sustain the momentum in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the segment reported revenue increase of 6% following gains of 12%, 9% and 6% in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. The consensus mark for revenues from the segment for the first-quarter fiscal 2018 is pegged at $4,866 million, reflecting an increase of 6.8% year over year. Disney is focused on deploying its capital toward expansion of the Parks and Resorts business, consequently increasing market share and creating long-term growth opportunities.The segment continues to show robust performances both domestically and internationally owing to rise in customer spending, higher ticket prices and attendance. Moreover, the company is on the verge of completing Toy Story Lands in Shanghai and Orlando, which are likely to open doors by this summer. Further, constructions of Star Wars Lands in Disneyland as well as Walt Disney World are in progress. | Moreover, the company's overall top and bottom-lines are expected to increase in the first quarter driven by robust performance of Parks & Resorts and Studio entertainment segments.

"he U.S. telecom industry remained rather subdued last week. Very few developments took place in the Christmas/New Year week. We will briefly mention those events.Verizon Communications Inc.  , Ericsson AB  and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc.  , recently completed the first successful FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing) Massive MIMO (Multiple Input-Multiple Output) trial with a fully-compatible customer device.The trial was completed using Ericsson's latest Massive MIMO software and hardware and Verizon's wireless network on a mobile test device. The test device was powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset (which was equipped with the X20 LTE modem). The modem supports the Transmission Mode 9 (TM9) technology which is compatible with Massive MIMO. The tests were conducted in Irvine, CA.Windstream Holdings Inc.  has inked a deal to acquire MassComm, Inc., a privately held, New York-based competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC). The proposed deal will be an all-cash transaction, wherein the leading local exchange carrier will purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of MassComm. On completion, MassComm will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream.Liberty Interactive Corp.'s  QVC division recently completed the acquisition of the remaining 61.8% of the home-shopping platform HSN Inc. in an all-stock deal worth $2.1 billion. The newly combined company will have $14 billion in revenues and 23 million customers across the world.The merged entity will result in the third-largest online site, behind Amazon.com Inc.  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s  e-commerce business. Liberty Interactive currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Meanwhile, Liberty Global plc  also completed the spin-off of its Latin American and Caribbean operations into a new, independent, publicly traded company, Liberty Latin America Ltd., which was previously a unit of Liberty Global under the LiLAC Group. The spin-off transformed each share of the LiLAC Group tracking stock into equity shares of the new company's common stock.In a separate development, Altice USA Inc.  and Starz Inc. reportedly failed to ink a new programming deal on the New Year's Eve. This led to the blackout of 17 Starz, StarzEncore and MoviePlex premium channels in Altice USA's Optimum and Suddenlink cable TV services.Read the last  .1. Massive MIMO is a vital component of 4G LTE Advancements and is likely to play a major role in the evolution of 5G technology. Accordingly, the deployment of Massive MIMO antenna setups will prepare the network for the upcoming next-generation 5G deployment. With TM9 functionality, Massive MIMO has the potential to improve the performance of the LTE network, maintain signal stability and thus enhance overall customer experience with higher speeds.

Moreover, MassComm's existing customers can avail Windstream's broader on-net portfolio of network access options, which are provided to support software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN) and other managed services.

It will also generate synergies through cost reduction and revenue growth opportunities. Further, it will increase the development of eCommerce, mobile and OTT (over-the-top) platforms.

Liberty Latin America will now operate as a leading telecommunications company in 20 countries including Chile, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America, under the consumer brands VTR, Flow, Liberty, Mas Movil and BTC. It will cover 6.4 million homes, serving 5.3 million revenue generating units and 3.7 million mobile subscribers. The newly-formed company will have $3.7 billion in annual revenues. (Read more:  )5. Due to declining viewership and lesser popularity, Altice USA is likely to drop extra charges from customers for Starz programming. Also, the programs are available directly through Starzs' own OTT service. On the other hand, Starz blamed Altice USA of demanding a drastic reduction in carriage price, compared with the market. The failure to ink a new carriage deal implies tense talks between the companies over how much the cable operator should pay to continue offering the premium channels to customers. (Read more:  )The following table shows the price movement of the major telecom stocks in both the last week and the last six months.
  
In the last five trading sessions, share price movement of most of the major telecom stocks witnessed a mixed trend. Sprint and Charter Communications gained significantly in the same time frame. Similarly, price performances of most of the major telecom stocks were mixed in the last six months. Sprint and DISH Network suffered major reverses in the stock price, while Verizon gained attractively in the same time period.We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week.

"he Dow took a tiny break on Tuesday, but the NASDAQ and S&P continued their record-setting ways. Earnings season is in full swing and there's no threat of a government shutdown (for now) to avert the market's attention. As expected, Netflix was a big winner in the session with a gain of practically 10% after its strong quarterly results and impressive rise in subscribers.The streaming service's strong performance helped secure a couple of new all-time highs. The NASDAQ jumped 0.71% to 7460.3 and the S&P rose 0.22% to 2839.1. However, the Dow waffled between gains and losses all day, and finally settled on a 0.01% decline to 26,210.8.It was a busy day for the portfolios as  ,  and  all added stocks. Meanwhile,  cashed in two double digit winners that recently received big buyout offers. Finally,  swapped out four positions. After yesterday's ""Magnificent Merger Monday"" in which TWO portfolio positions were offered ""fat"" buyouts, we knew that Kevin was on the verge of cashing in some enormous profits. Today was the day! The editor sold Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) for an approximately 98% return in a little over a month and also got out of Bioverativ (BIVV) for a gain of more than 75% in about 5 months. Kevin is currently researching their replacements. When a company pre-reports far in advance of its scheduled quarterly release, its usually for really good or really bad reasons. For Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY), it was the latter case as the restaurant and entertainment company announced a more than 5% plunge in same-store sales. Shares dropped 20% at one point on the news, but it also led to big buys from a pair of directors. Tracey sees this as a classic case of a large selloff that makes shares much more attractive, especially for a company like PLAY that is rolling out several new initiatives. The editor added this stock on Tuesday. Read the full write-up for a lot more on this new addition. Kevin finally showed his hand Tuesday on a high-flying tech name he had in his sights: Square (SQ). The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) financial and marketing services company is richly-valued but must be seen for its ""platform potential"" and strong growth. In other words, normal valuation metrics don't provide the best visibility for the future in a situation like this. Kevin added SQ with a 7% allocation and plans to buy more if it slips below $40. Get all the specifics on this new addition in the complete commentary. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have sold off of late, but Brian Bolan sees long-term potential in this space. With that in mind, the editor bought GAIN Capital (GCAP) on Tuesday, which runs an exchange for cryptocurrencies that is very popular in some Asian countries. He is well aware that this is a riskier play and notes that it may end up being a quick trade if there's a significant increase in price.

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYA) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.2, after changing hands as low as $31.12 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 50.2. A bullish investor could look at LBTYA's 28.2 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of LBTYA shares:    Looking at the chart above, LBTYA's low point in its 52 week range is $28.17 per share, with $39.73 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $31.14.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Oversold Conditions For Liberty Global (LBTYA)@2018-02-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/oversold-conditions-liberty-global-lbtya-2018-02-28
 recently completed the spin-off of its Latin American and Caribbean operations into a new, independent, publicly-traded company - Liberty Latin America Ltd. Following the announcement, shares of Liberty Global rose 1.14% to $36.24 on Jan 2.Liberty Latin America was previously a unit of Liberty Global under the LiLAC Group. The spin-off transformed each share of the LiLAC Group tracking stock into equity shares of the new company's common stock.Liberty Latin America will now operate as a leading telecommunications company in 20 countries including Chile, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America, under the consumer brands VTR, Flow, Liberty, Mas Movil and BTC. It will cover 6.4 million homes, serving 5.3 million revenue generating units (RGUs) and 3.7 million mobile subscribers. The newly-formed company will have $3.7 billion in annual revenues. In addition, Liberty Latin America operates a sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable network that connects over 40 markets in the region.Balan Nair, former Chief Technology & Innovation Officer for Liberty Global, will become the President and CEO of Liberty Latin America. Liberty Global CEO, Mike Fries, will serve as Executive Chairman of the Liberty Latin America. The board of the new company is likely to include other members from the directors of the parent company.A corporate spin-off is an operational business strategy opted by a company to create a new business entity out of its existing divisions, subsidiaries or the subunits. It is a way of reorganizing administrative structure to rake in more profit. Businesses intending to streamline operations often sell less productive or unrelated subsidiary businesses as spin-offs.The aforementioned spin-off was caused by declining revenues from the respective business units. Notably, hurricanes Irma and Maria damaged the company's cable systems in Puerto Rico, the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Anguilla and Turks and Caicos. The company's third-quarter 2017 revenues down by $19 million in Puerto Rico and $3 million from Cable & Wireless Communications business, came at $908 million. The company estimates fourth-quarter 2017 revenues getting to fall $95-$125 million due to hurricane effects. This might continue in the first half of 2018.Persistent lack of electrical power in many areas on the island hurts the company's ability to provide service. Repairing property and equipment is expected to cost more than $150 million, some of which will be covered by insurance policies.However, the new company is expected to perform better in the Latin American and Caribbean region with easy access to the required capital resources, shared services and expertise across products, technology and procurement. The new launch will create more value for shareholders. The spun-off companies are expected to be more profitable and valuable as independent entities.Moreover, spin-offs help the parent company focus more on resources that have better long-term potential and higher prospects.Currently, Liberty Global carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  .Liberty Global portrays an impressive price performance.

Several analysts opine that the sale might pave the way for a $175 billion merger of Liberty Global with Vodafone Group plc  . The companies have already merged their Dutch operations (in December 2016) by forming a 50-50 joint venture (JV) in Netherlands.

 has started the nationwide rollout of the DOCSIS 3.1 technology, with its latest xFi Advanced Gateway. Comcast will lease the DOCSIS 3.1-powered, multi-gigabit advanced gateway, formerly known as the XB6, for $10 a month in nearly 75% of operating area.ARRIS International plc.  and Technicolor are the two major DOCSIS 3.1 equipment manufacturers for Comcast. ARRIS will use Intel Corp's  chipsets for its version, while Technicolor will manufacture another version using Broadcom chips.Comcast has been extensively deploying DOCSIS 3.1 network in several markets in the United States. The company has offered 1 Gbps downstream and 35 Mbps upstream speeds for DOCSIS 3.1 network. Comcast Business launched DOCSIS 3.1-based internet service to business customers in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States including Greater Boston, Greater Philadelphia, New Jersey, northern Delaware as well as in Baltimore, Charlottesville and Washington.Upgrading to DOCSIS 3.1 will enable Comcast to compete against AT&T's ongoing Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) program. We believe that DOCSIS 3.1 and Gigabit Pro rollout is slated to drive prospects.The XB6 devices is compatible with DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1 networks. XB6 also supports MoCA 2.0, dual-band 802.11ac WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth LE (low energy), as well as ports for digital voice services. The new gateway will have a 160 MHz-capable 8x8 Wi-Fi antenna array, Mu-MiMo (Multi-user, Multi-input, Multi-output) technology and a combination of specialized IoT radios.Per sources, Comcast is chalking a retail strategy for the XB6, which will employ a new self-install system.DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was designed as the cable-TV industry's answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators. The old-generation DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable-TV operators compete in the race for fastest internet speed available in the market.The next-generation DOCSIS 3.1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3.0. Theoretically, while DOCSIS 3.0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 comes with several operational benefits.The technology is also backward compatible, allowing the present hybrid fiber-coaxial cable lines to allow high internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem. Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth, backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3.1. This allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed Gigabit broadband to customers, without having to incur additional digging or cable laying costs. This is expected to boost margins of cable MSOs.Leading European cable MSO Liberty Global plc.  has decided to install DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure during the fourth quarter of 2017. Mediacom Communications is also offering DOCSIS 3.1. Cox Communications is going through the trial phase of this technology.Comcast currentlycarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .In the past month, the stock has returned 1.8% against the  's decline of 1.0%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7% and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

"he tech-heavy NASDAQ made a valiant effort on Tuesday to comeback from a couple of very rough sessions, but it ultimately failed to see the rally through to the end. The index spent the majority of the day on positive ground even as its counterparts slipped into the red. By the end of the day though, the NASDAQ too had given back all its gains and finished with a loss of 0.19% to 6762.2.The Dow had been making new all-time highs while the other two major indices struggled. But today it joined the malaise as a late shift lower brought about a loss of 0.45% to 24,180.6.

"he U.S. telecom did not witness much development last week. Nevertheless, a few are worth taking note of.Verizon Communications Inc.  plans to launch next-generation 5G wireless residential broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018. The first commercial launch is scheduled in Sacramento, CA, in the second half of 2018. Verizon will be using millimeter-wave spectrum (radio signals) instead of copper or fiber cables, in order to provide customers with unmatched wireless speeds for Internet access.Qualcomm Inc.  recently filed three new patent infringement complaints against tech giant Apple Inc.  . The leading wireless chipset manufacturer claimed that 16 of its patents were being used by Apple in its iPhones. The three cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. Notably, on Nov 29, 2017, Apple alleged that Qualcomm's Snapdragon mobile phone chips, which power various Android-based devices, infringe Apple's patents.T-Mobile US Inc.  has requested for Special Temporary Authority (STA) from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to test microwave radio spectrum bands in two sites in Bellevue, WA. The company has plans of evaluating microwave radio spectrum with integrated antenna for the 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz bands.Sprint Corp.  reportedly filed a patent infringement complaint against Mediacom Communications in the federal court in Delaware. Mediacom is a New York-based cable television and communications provider. Sprint currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Per a recent Bloomberg report, Comcast Corp.  is eyeing the takeover of Sky plc  , a U.K.-based broadcasting company and European pay-TV provider. Sky's technological assets will complement Comcast's X1 platform, Xfinity-branded X1 set-top boxes and wireless services.Charter Communications Inc.  and Altice USA Inc.  have reportedly reached an agreement to broadcast their respective regional cable news networks.

However, it has to face challenges of combining legacy voice networks and packet networks. (Read more:  )5. The reported sale of Liberty Global's Swiss and Austrian cable businesses was due to declining revenues and subscriber counts from the respective business units.

On the other hand, price performances of most of the major telecom stocks were negative in the last six months. Sprint, DISH Network and Telefonica suffered major reverses in the stock price in the same time period.We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week. Nevertheless, two major data, one on retail sales and another on industrial production will be released this week. Moreover, Federal Open Market Committee of the central bank will release its policy statements. The market will closely monitor these data.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

"he U.S. telecom industry did not witness much activity last week. Nevertheless, a few developments are worth taking note of.Per a recent FierceCable report, cable and satellite television companies are gearing up to hike prices of their packages. Major pay-TV operators like Comcast Corp.  , DISH Network Corp.  and Cox Communications Inc. have notified their customers about the increase in programming package rates, effective 2018. U.S. telecom behemoth, AT&T Inc.  has also announced monthly price increase for it's over the top (OTT) online streaming service, DirecTV Now.Leading wireline and wireless service providers that are interested in extending their reach in rural United States with high-speed broadband services will get a chance to bid for an additional $2 billion in government's Connect America Fund II (CAFII) subsidy. In 2015, a number of large wireline operators including AT&T, CenturyLink Inc.  , Frontier Communications Corp.  and Windstream Holdings Inc.  accepted $9 billion over a period of six years from Phase II of the Connect America Fund to expand broadband in their rural service areas.Moreover, AT&T has requested for a Special Temporary Authority from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct 5G tests on the 3.5 GHz frequency band. The company plans to conduct tests for one month, commencing Feb 1, 2018, using L. M. Ericsson's  equipment inside a closed building in Washington, D.C. AT&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc.  has launched a new video service, FiOS Current TV, targeting the SMB segment, especially health clinics, consulting firms, restaurants, health clubs, bars, and cafes. Verizon offers two categories of services to its SMB customers, $40 per month without a contract and $30 per month with a two-year agreement. Additionally, the company is offering Current TV at $25 per month for SMB customers ordering a triple-play bundle with a two-year agreement.Meanwhile, Altice USA Inc.  and TiVo Corp.  have signed an extended six-year patent agreement. The deal extends Altice USA's license to TiVo's patent portfolios and will broadcast new features across the newly formed platform - Altice One. Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers, while TiVo is a global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights.Outside the United States, leading European and Latin American cable MSO (multi service operator) Liberty Global plc  was in the headline for a couple of news. In a move to enhance shareholders' wealth, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program. The new authorization permits Liberty Global to buy back Liberty Global Group Class A ordinary shares, Class C ordinary shares, or a combination of Class A and Class C ordinary shares, up to $2 billion. Additionally, the company has inked a deal to sell its Austrian cable business, UPC Austria to T-Mobile Austria for 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion).Read the last  .1. Pay-TV operators have cited various reasons for price increase. Increasing cost of programming content continues to be one of the main reasons of video rates increase. Continuous investment in network, products and services also add to the company's budget. The move comes at a time when cable companies are reporting video subscriber losses to the online video streaming service providers. (Read more:  )2. In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission had (FCC) offered more than $10 billion over the next six years in CAFII subsidy to deploy high-speed Internet connections through rural United States. In May 2016, the FCC had approved a reverse auction to provide an additional $2 billion in funds to rural broadband providers through its CAF II program in an effort to accelerate growth. (Read more:  )3. AT&T is awaiting final guidelines from the FCC. The FCC is considering new rules for the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band. Earlier, major U.S. telecom operators commercialized the 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, raising scope of providing spectrum globally. (Read more:  )4. Verizon offers fiber-optic based FiOS TV services to its residential customers. This service is similar to that of cable TV operator's traditional video offerings. Currently, the company is on the verge of carrying out test trial runs for its IPTV upgrade. In 2015, the company launched go90, a YouTube-like streaming-video service for teenagers. However, the company is planning to merge go90 into its digital platform, Oath. (Read more:  )5. Altice USA will deploy TiVo's Personalized Content Discovery platform to feature programs across Altice One platform. The Personalized Content Discovery platform combines TiVo's personalized search and recommendations with voice search functionality. Altice USA will continue to use TiVo's i-Guide interactive program guide and Gateway DVR solution that provide over-the-top (OTT) content.

In the last five trading sessions, share price movement of most of the major telecom stocks was positive. Charter Communications and Sprint gained significantly in the same time frame. Likewise, price performances of most of the major telecom stocks were positive in the last six months. Sprint and DISH Network suffered major reverses in the stock price, while Verizon gained attractively in the same time period.We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week.

" is  considering sale of Swiss and Austrian cable businesses.The leading European quad-play cable multi service operator (MSO) is currently engaged in initial talks with buyers to divest UPC Austria and UPC Switzerland units. While UPC Austria is the largest cable television operator in Austria, UPC Switzerland LLC is the largest broadband cable operator in Switzerland.The reported sale has been caused by declining revenues and subscriber counts from the respective business units. In the last reported quarter, the company's Swiss subscriber base declined and revenues fell 2%, due to increased competition from Swisscom. Swisscom is a major telecommunications provider in Switzerland, which has aggressively reduced broadband prices.Moreover, UPC Switzerland's heavy investments in its recently launched sports channel and marketing schemes for television packages have reduced cash flow. Revenues of $1.36 billion came from around 1.3 million customers.Notably, Swiss mobile operators - Sunrise Communications AG and Salt Mobile SA - might be interested in purchasing UPC Switzerland to boost market shares and revamp their mobile and fixed line convergence.UPC Austria is a smaller business with most of its cable network in Vienna and revenues of only $342 million. It is unclear whether Liberty Global plans to sell it separately or as a package with its Swiss arm.Several analysts opine that the sale of UPC Austria and UPC Switzerland goes through, then it might pave the way for a $175 billion merger of Liberty Global with Vodafone Group plc  . The companies have already merged their Dutch operations (in December 2016) by forming a 50-50 joint venture (JV) in Netherlands. Rumors related to a possible deal between the above two in Germany, also persist.Apart from the joint venture with Vodafone, launch of DOCSIS 3.1 network services, the long-term agreement with Netflix Inc.  and the takeover of Cable & Wireless are anticipated to drive growth in the future.Currently, Liberty Global carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .With such positives, Liberty Global portrays an impressive price performance.

The company's sales and earnings estimates for fourth-quarter 2017 are estimated to increase 23.6% and 38.9%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Apparently, there's been some confusion in the quarterly report for Forterra (FRTA). It was first reported as a big loss, but has since been corrected as a beat. Brian Bolan wants to capitalize on this confusion, so he added this pipemaker to the portfolio on Tuesday. The editor believes that the stock is moving higher and should see double digits in the next few weeks. Plus, as a construction play, he likes that FRTA will bring some diversification to the portfolio. Read the full write-up for more on this addition.

"ith all the talk of media mergers these days, there's been an ongoing debate as to whether other content producers could potentially catch up to  (NASDAQ: NFLX) in the streaming races. Well, one of the founders of modern cable, John Malone of  (NASDAQ: LBTYA) , has weighed in. And his answer: Nope.Recently, John Malone sat down with CNBC's David Faber for a  . While the interview was a wide-ranging look at the modern media business, there was a lot of airtime given to Netflix. Malone believes one can't help but, ""take your hat off and envy what [Reed Hastings] has built."" Malone once advocated that cable companies should band together for their own Netflix-like service, but now even he admits it's, ""way too late."" Here are the reasons why.Image source: Netflix.As you might be aware, Netflix was the first to seize on the global internet TV opportunity. Since the internet gives webscale content providers a worldwide platform, content providers have a much larger base they can build to. In order to capture all of those global eyeballs, however, you need to give them something they want to watch.Netflix was the first to realize the playing field was much bigger than the traditional cable footprint, which has historically been a domestic phenomenon. Cable distribution companies traditionally had to build or buy their (expensive) footprints, and content providers could only sell into a few distributors at once, and only for a few specific countries and territories where that content could scale.Netflix broke all those rules, however, scaling quickly to 190 countries with over 100 million subscribers, and plowing all of its earnings (and then some) back into more and more content. The $8 billion Netflix plans to spend next year dwarfs all other content producers such as HBO, formerly the biggest premium player, which is only spending $2.5 billion.Why is scale so important? Because a lead in scale can become very profitable if you become the first go-to global service. As Malone said:In other words, at some point, Netflix will stop its spending increases. But by then, it will have amassed such a huge content library that rivals may not be able to match it. Then, of course, every new subscriber (or dollar it  ) will fall directly to the bottom line.Netflix employs a rather disruptive business model. Netflix is now striking deals directly with producers and creators, working around the studio system that has long been the gatekeeper to Hollywood. I wrote about this  when Shonda Rhimes and the Coen Brothers struck deals with Netflix directly, but those two huge creative names are just a couple on a long list for Netflix.The separation from the traditional bureaucracy of Hollywood is not only good for efficiency but the freedom allows the show creators to do things differently and take more creative risks. For instance, the company's recent show  is a three-camera sitcom, but also has a heavy dose of animation, musical numbers, and even custom commercials for Lay's potato chips (even though Netflix is an ad-free service!).Finally, could other companies like HBO and other domestic providers achieve the same scale as Netflix by licensing their content to international service providers? Not exactly. Malone believes having a direct relationship with the customer and accumulating all the data that comes with that is immensely valuable. Netflix has been using its data algorithms ever since it launched its first big show in  , and by now it seems these capabilities have only grown.""Jeff,"" as Malone refers to him -- as in, Bezos, as in,  (NASDAQ: AMZN) -- could be the only one that has a chance of overtaking Netflix, Malone says, and that's only because Amazon has ""a different monetization model."" Like Netflix, Amazon doesn't worry about  profits either, and also has huge scale, not only in video but all of retail and cloud computing as well.The metaphor Malone used for Amazon? The ""Death Star.""If you're a Netflix investor, you should feel pretty good a guy as knowledgeable as John Malone thinks it's way too late for others to catch up in the streaming race... just keep an eye on ""Jeff's company,"" in the years ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Even This Cable Legend Thinks Netflix Has Already Won the Streaming Race@2017-12-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/even-cable-legend-thinks-netflix-has-already-won-streaming-race-2017-12-04
ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (Symbol: VXF) where we have detected an approximate $43.1 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.8% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 48,704,258.0 to 49,105,192.0). Among the largest underlying components of VXF, in trading today Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA) is up about 1.3%, Las Vegas Sands Corp (Symbol: LVS) is trading flat, and Liberty Global plc Class A Ord (Symbol: LBTYA) is lower by about 0.3%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of VXF, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, VXF's low point in its 52 week range is $89.58 per share, with $109.29 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $107.44. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@VXF, TSLA, LVS, LBTYA: ETF Inflow Alert@2017-11-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vxf-tsla-lvs-lbtya-etf-inflow-alert-2017-11-13
"he last week looked like a bad spell for the telecom sector as most of the major telecom stocks lost value.

egacy pay-TV operators are yet to come to terms with the onslaught of low-cost online video streaming service providers. In the last 10 years, the internal dynamics of the pay-TV market have gradually shifted from legacy pay-TV offerings to low-cost OTT (over-the-top) service providers.In June 2017, research firm SNL Kagan had predicted that the U.S. pay-TV industry (comprising cable, satellite and IPTV operators) will lose approximately 10.8 million customers by 2021. Total pay-TV subscribers will be around 82.3 million at that time, which will be 20% less than the industry's historical high level. Last month, Research firm RBC predicted that customer churn in the legacy pay-TV segment could soon accelerate to around 5 million a year.Moreover, the third quarter of any year is generally known for weak seasonality in the pay-TV segment. Despite this gloomy picture, pay-TV operators currently enjoy certain positives.The cable multi-service operators (MSOs) in the United States have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (Internet) market. According to data compiled by LRG, 14 prime cable TV and telecom operators jointly had around 94.1 million high-speed broadband subscribers at the end of the second quarter of 2017, representing more than 95% of the country's total broadband market. Of the count cited, cable MSOs commanded nearly 59.91 million subscribers (63.6%), while the remaining 34.24 million customers (36.8%) were serviced by telecom operators.With the global pay-TV industry continuously evolving, companies in the league are fighting it out to stay ahead in the competition. The latest in the league is the newly launched DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections.The old-generation DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest internet speed available in the market. The next-generation DOCSIS 3.1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3.0.Theoretically, while DOCSIS 3.0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 comes with a slew of operational benefits. The technology is also backward compatible, enabling the present hybrid fiber-coaxial cable lines to allow such high Internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem.In June 2017, research firm Strategy Analytics estimated that annual spending on subscription video and TV services in the United States will reach $130.3 billion in 2019. Major pay-TV operators who offer both traditionally managed TV services and next-generation online services will hold nearly 80% of the market share till 2022. They will continue to do so despite facing intensified competition from OTT service providers. The pay-TV operator's average revenue is still 10 times higher than the online-video-streaming service providers.At this stage, we believe investors should choose stocks that carry a favorable Zacks Rank to cash in on future growth.

Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable TV operators, seems to be fast slipping out of their hands. In order to remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering Internet TV with selected TV channels at cheap rate. Internet TV can be viewed using a broadband connection and mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, Roku box and smart TV, to name a few.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new November 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $32.50 strike price has a current bid of 90 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $32.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $31.60 (before broker commissions).

Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.35% if the stock gets called away at the November 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.52% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.86% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.

"ROGRAMMING ALERT: John Blank was on CNBC's  again this afternoon. He joined a panel discussing the S&P's chances of surpassing 2500 and Apple's new iPhone. The worst of the storms has passed, North Korea hasn't been trigger-happy of late, and the government actually seems determined to pass some kind of tax reform. The major indices had a lot of positive things to consider today, allowing each of the Big 3 to end at all-time highs. said Brian Bolan in  .The S&P logged its second straight record with a gain of 0.34% to 2496.5. So it is once again on the doorstep of 2500 with less than 5 points to go. It's been here before only to pullback before reaching the goal. Is it finally going to make it? said Jeremy in The other two major indices also hit new highs on Tuesday. The NASDAQ climbed 0.34% to 6454.3 and the Dow advanced 0.28% to 22,118.9.In the portfolios,  finally felt comfortable enough to make some moves, so Jeremy added a new stock, added to an existing stock and sold a position. Meanwhile,  had a double-digit winner as it swapped out two names this week. Read more in the highlights section below… Jeremy has been waiting to make some moves in the portfolio…and today he finally got the opportunity. For starters, he bought an 11% allocation in the navigation and communication equipment company Garmin (GRMN). The stock has gone nowhere in the past year, but it recently reported its 8th straight beat and raised its guidance. Computer traders kept the company from gaining on the news, but the editor feels that this opened a great chance to buy. Eventually, he expects it to move to more than $60.Also, remember that crazy story that PetMed Express (PETS) was marketing to opioid addicts? Jeremy didn't believe it, and it turned out to be just as false as it sounded. Now he expects the stock to move towards $40. With shares down more than 20% despite a solid quarterly report, he added 4% to the portfolio's current allocation. By the way, Counterstrike also sold BREW today for a 4.4% profit. Read the complete commentary for more on these moves. The portfolio had a double-digit winner this week by short-covering PDC Energy (PDCE) for a 12.9% return. It also got out of ConocoPhillips (COP). The new additions that replaced these names are Liberty Global (LBTYA) and Cheniere Energy (LNG).

Shaw Communications recently sold its data center operations, ViaWest, to Peak 10 Holding Corp. the company also completed the purchase of wireless spectrums from Quebecor Media Inc.Shaw Communications completed the sale of ViaWest to privately held Peak 10 Holding Corporation, for a consideration of C$2.3 billion (around $1.675 billion). Shaw Communications expects net cash proceeds of C$900 million after paying for nearly US$580 million of ViaWest's debt and US$380 million of credit facility borrowings associated with the original takeover.Further, Shaw Communications has decided to spend the net proceeds from ViaWest sale to acquire highly valuable wireless spectrums. On Jul 24, 2017, Shaw Communications announced the closing of the acquisition of 700 MHz and 2500 MHz wireless spectrum licenses from Quebecor Media for $430 million. This includes 10 MHz of 700 MHz spectrum in British Columbia, Alberta and Southern Ontario, as well as 20 MHz of 2,500 MHz spectrum in Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Toronto.The company's outlook upgradation by Moody's Investor Services was a major positive. The rating agency reaffirmed the company's Baa3 senior unsecured ratings. Moody's stated that the primary reason for the upgrade is the recent business restructurings of Shaw Communications.Additionally, in the third quarter of 2017, Shaw Communications witnessed massive growth of cable TV subscribers for the first time since 2010, marking an overall gain of 58,491 subscribers from Consumer and Wireless divisions.

.S. telecom giant  is reportedly exploring a strategic option to sell a major part of its pay-TV operations in Latin America, per  . The company acquired these assets as part of its $49 billion takeover of the satellite TV operator DIRECTV.At present, AT&T holds 93% Sky Brasil along with PanAmericana satellite and cable TV services. The company has 13.6 billion subscribers across Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Uruguay. Notably, Brazil solely commands 5.52 million customers. In the second quarter of 2017, Latin American business generated $1.4 billion in revenues, half of which came from Sky Brasil.We believe that there exist two reasons for AT&T to mull over Latin American pay-TV business sales. First, the company has decided to acquire U.S. media behemoth Time Warner Inc.  for about $85.4 billion. If the deal materializes, the company's outstanding debt will cross an enormous $180 billion.Management is pursuing a number of other options to raise funds and pay down debt for the acquisition. The company is expecting to raise around $22.5 billion through a seven-tier bond offering. It has decided to sell Digital Life home security business for around $1 billion. As per  , AT&T is hopeful about collecting approximately $8 billion for the divestiture of Latin American pay-TV assets. Liberty Global plc.  , Telefonica SA  and Millicom are possible buyers.With respect to Time Warner merger, AT&T is yet to get regulatory approval from two countries. Beside the home country United States, the other one is Brazil. CADE, the antitrust agency of Brazil, has argued that the approval of the deal will violate the agency's stated policy of the separation of service providers and content developers. For that, CADE wants AT&T to disinvest its pay-TV assets in that country. Notably, Sky Brazil currently holds about 29% of the pay-TV market in Brazil, followed by cable TV operator Net Servicos de Comunicacao.Meanwhile, AT&T has decided not to sale pay-TV assets in Mexico. The company already has a strong foothold in the country's wireless market. Leveraging, wireless and pay-TV services, AT&T is looking to extensively explore the lucrative Mexican telecom market.Over the past 90 days, the stock price of AT&T has decreased 3.83% compared with the  decline of 1.46%.

he need to remain connected is essentially human. An era of digitization and technology is built on this need. It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom space in an otherwise tough environment. With the global telecom industry continuously evolving, companies in the league are fighting it out to stay ahead in the competition. The latest in the league is the newly launched DOCSIS 3.1 technology.DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was specifically designed as the cable TV industry's answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators. The old-generation DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest internet speed available in the market.The next-generation DOCSIS 3.1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3.0. Theoretically, while DOCSIS 3.0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 comes with several operational benefits.The technology is also backward compatible, allowing the present hybrid fiber-coaxial cable lines to allow such high internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem. Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth, backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3.1. This allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed Gigabit broadband to customers, without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs, unlike FTTH providers. This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs.In the U.S., the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) Comcast Corp.  is extensively deploying DOCSIS 3.1 network in several markets. The company is offering 1 Gbps downstream and 35 Mbps upstream speeds for its DOCSIS 3.1 network. Mediacom Communications is also offering DOCSIS 3.1. Cox Communications is currently going through the trial phase of this technology.Leading European cable MSO Liberty Global plc.  has decided to install DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure from the fourth quarter of 2017. Major DOCSIS 3.1 equipment manufacturers are ARRIS International plc.  , NETGEAR Inc.  and Casa Systems Inc. All the above mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market's record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There's a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

"nvestors in Liberty Global Plc (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 2018 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new April 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $32.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $32.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $30.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $34.28/share today.Because the $32.50 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 9.09% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, and highlighting in green where the $32.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $34.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.54% if the stock gets called away at the April 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (Symbol: EUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $55.74 per unit.With EUSA trading at a recent price near $50.29 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.83% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@We Did The Math EUSA Can Go To $56@2017-08-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-math-eusa-can-go-56-2017-08-22

"Chicago, IL - August 11, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Eli Lilly (NYSE:  -  ), Halliburton (NYSE:  -  ), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:  -  ), Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:  -  ) and Liberty Global (NASDAQ:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly (NYSE:  -  ), Halliburton (NYSE:  -  ) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:  -  ). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Pharmaceutical stocks have been under pressure since last year on pricing and regulatory concerns and  shares have been no different. That said, the stock has done modestly better than the peer group; it is up +12.2% year to date vs. +10.9% gain for the Zacks Pharma industry and +9.5% increase for the Zacks Medical sector as a whole. Lilly's second-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts.The company also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. Lilly's new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo have been performing well and the trend is expected to continue. The Zacks analyst is encouraged by the fact that Lilly expects to launch 20 new products between 2014 and 2023, including at least two new indications/line extensions on an average every year.However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs.(You can  .Oil-related stocks have been under pressure this year on stubborn global crude glut and  shares have been no different. That said, the stock has done better than the peer group; it is down -23.6% in 2017 vs. -31.2% loss for the Zacks Oil Field Services industry.The world's No. 2 oilfield-services provider reported strong Q2 profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton's 12th consecutive quarterly beat was aided by cost saving initiatives. HAL is also set to gain from the Summit ESP buyout on account of the latter's expertise in extending the life of shale wells.However, pricing pressure across the international markets is likely to dampen investor confidence. Moreover, with the failure of the BHI acquisition, HAL had to book a massive $3.5 billion in breakup charges that stretched its balance sheet. Hence, the Zacks analyst thinks investors should wait for a better entry point before buying shares in HAL.(You can  . 's shares have gained +17.4% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Soft Drink industry's gain of +13.9% during the same period. Monster Beverage's earnings missed expectations but increased.6% year over year on higher sales. The international segment posted strong results and looks well positioned for the days ahead.The Zacks analyst likes the fact that the company has several new products lined up for the remaining of 2017 which are likely to boost sales. The company successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets in the quarter and expects further transitions and launches in the second half of the year. However, operating expenses continue to rise. Results were also hurt by unfavorable currency rates which dented quarterly net sales.(You can  .Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:  -  ) and Liberty Global (NASDAQ:  -  ).Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: VXF, TSLA, LVS, LBTYA@2017-08-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-vxf-tsla-lvs-lbtya-2017-08-04
"he Dow ended its 35-session record run of wins for the year on Tuesday, tumbling after Trump sounded off a fresh warning to North Korea. The blue-chip index was led lower primarily by a drop in shares of Merck, DuPont and Nike. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also closed in the red. Ten out of the eleven primary sectors of the S&P 500 ended in negative territory. Losses for the broader market index were led materials, telecom and real estate sectors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,085.34, declining by 0.2% or 33.08 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.2%, rising 5.99 points to close at 2,474.92. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,370.46, declining 13.31 points or 0.2%. A total of around 6.22 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.15 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.73-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.47-to-1 ratio.Broader markets declined on Tuesday after President Trump announced that North Korea would be dealt with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"", if the rogue country continues to threaten the US. However, this ""red line"" was challenged later in the day when a spokesman from the Korean People's Army (KPA) told reporters that Kim Jong-un was planning an attack on Guam Naval and Air base. Pyongyang has in the recent past tested several nuclear missiles and the one that it tested last month was said to bring mainland US within striking range.After the renegade nation launched two intercontinental missiles last month, the UN voted unanimously to punish North Korea for such an act and imposed trade sanctions against North Korea which might cost it about $1 billion a year. In an act of rage, and blaming the US for influencing the decision, Pyongyang vowed today to make America pay dearly for this.Markets had gained earlier in the session but closed with losses after Trump warned Kim Jong-un of dire consequences. Experts suggest that Trump would not be willing to take any actions now that North Korea has already crossed the 'red line'.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which gauges fear in the markets, increased to about 11%, still trading near its all-time low. By all accounts, this has been the quietest stretch of trading since 1965. One estimate puts the current level of volatility at the lowest in 52 years. Since Jul 19, the S&P 500 has not gained or lost 0.5% over a single session. In fact, the index has swung 1% either way only four times over the entire year till date. The only exception to such placid behavior has been the Nasdaq, which has moved 1% over 11 trading days.To put things in perspective, the market's so called ""fear gauge"", the VIX, continues to linger near its lowest point in 23 years and more. The popular measure of market volatility had plummeted to this level on May 8, within striking distance of where the market stands. Of course, this has translated into strong gains for the average investor, with the S&P 500 up more than 9% year to date.Liberty Global Plc.  , a leading European quad-play cable MSO (multi service operator), reported disappointing financial results in the second quarter of 2017.

"s per the Zacks Industry categorization, the Cable Television industry falls under the broader  sector, which is one of the 16 Zacks sectors.The cable television industry, one of the important industries in the U.S., has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. The existing saturation and competition of the multi-channel domestic video market has caused this loss. Online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc.  , Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe threat to cable TV operators due to their cheap source of TV programming.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates. Meanwhile, two major cable multi service operators (MSOs) in the U.S., Comcast Corp.  and Charter Communications Inc.  , have agreed to jointly work on their wireless services businesses to explore opportunities, and accelerate and enhance each other's ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace.With such mixed prospects and strategic business ideas, the  has gained 18.62% outperforming the S&P 500's increase of 13.7% over the past one year.The upcoming weeks will see some of the major cable television companies, such as Comcast Corp., Charter Communications, DISH Network Corp.  and Liberty Global plc.  releasing second-quarter 2017 earnings results.Shaw Communications Inc.  has reported impressive financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, on Jun 28, wherein both the bottom and top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.While Comcast and Charter Communications will report results on Jul 27, before market opens, Liberty Global plans to release its numbers on Aug 7, after market close. We look forward to see how these cable companies will perform.We are in the thick of the second-quarter earnings season with results from 97 S&P 500 members, accounting for 28.1% of the index's total market capitalization (based on the latest  article). Total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the year-ago period on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% surpassing revenue estimates.More than 800 companies will report results this week, including 183 S&P 500 members.For the second quarter, we anticipate the prospects of companies to improve steadily. In fact, our latest scorecard projects total second-quarter earnings improvement of 8.6% from the year-ago period on 4.7% higher revenues. This would follow 13.3% earnings growth in first-quarter 2017 on 7.0% revenue growth, recording the highest increase in almost two years.We predict that second-quarter earnings in the Consumer and Discretionary space will decline 1.5%, while revenues will rise 7.8% from the year-ago period.Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report earnings. Per the model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver an earnings beat.Meanwhile, we also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Investors interested in cable TV stocks can watch out for the two cable companies that are expected to report their second-quarter 2017 numbers, before the opening bell on Jul 27.Headquartered in Pennsylvania,  is one of the leading cable MSOs in the U.S.The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 49 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.

"The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly (LLY), Halliburton (HAL) and Monster Beverage (MNST).These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Pharmaceutical stocks have been under pressure since last year on pricing and regulatory concerns and  shares have been no different. That said, the stock has done modestly better than the peer group; it is up +12.2% year to date vs. +10.9% gain for the Zacks Pharma industry and +9.5% increase for the Zacks Medical sector as a whole. Lilly's second-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts.The company also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. Lilly's new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo have been performing well and the trend is expected to continue. The Zacks analyst is encouraged by the fact that Lilly expects to launch 20 new products between 2014 and 2023, including at least two new indications/line extensions on an average every year.However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs.(You can  .Oil-related stocks have been under pressure this year on stubborn global crude glut and  shares have been no different. That said, the stock has done better than the peer group; it is down -23.6% in 2017 vs. -31.2% loss for the Zacks Oil Field Services industry.The world's No. 2 oilfield-services provider reported strong Q2 profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton's 12th consecutive quarterly beat was aided by cost saving initiatives. HAL is also set to gain from the Summit ESP buyout on account of the latter's expertise in extending the life of shale wells.However, pricing pressure across the international markets is likely to dampen investor confidence. Moreover, with the failure of the BHI acquisition, HAL had to book a massive $3.5 billion in breakup charges that stretched its balance sheet. Hence, the Zacks analyst thinks investors should wait for a better entry point before buying shares in HAL.(You can  . 's shares have gained +17.4% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Soft Drink industry's gain of +13.9% during the same period. Monster Beverage's earnings missed expectations but increased.6% year over year on higher sales. The international segment posted strong results and looks well positioned for the days ahead.The Zacks analyst likes the fact that the company has several new products lined up for the remaining of 2017 which are likely to boost sales. The company successfully launched or transitioned Monster Energy Drinks to Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of markets in the quarter and expects further transitions and launches in the second half of the year. However, operating expenses continue to rise. Results were also hurt by unfavorable currency rates which dented quarterly net sales.(You can  .Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), Wellcare Health (WCG) and Liberty Global (LBTYA).Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

"Liberty Global (  )Comcast Corporation (  )Charter Communications (  )Verizon Communications (  )AT&T (  )T-Mobile (TMUS) Long LiLAC Class A (  ) equity $21.82 (as of 04/19/17) $44.89 (105.7% upside) 1 to 2 years spinoff of tracking stock, share repurchase, organic growth, margin expansion, and acquisition A John Malone business that is significantly undervalued relative to peers, LiLAC possesses the dominant fixed broadband network in the vast majority of their markets, owning sizable moats due to the benefits of scale and high fixed costs/capital expenditures in the cable industry.Due to the substantial growth of data, the inferiority of other data transfer alternatives, and the exceedingly low levels of broadband penetration in LiLAC's markets (as opposed to markets in the developed world), it is well positioned for substantial growth going forward, not to mention the real possibility of being able to roll up the relatively unconsolidated cable market in Latin America.Liberty Global is an international television, broadband internet, and telecommunications company. It offers broadband internet, Pay TV, fixed-line telephony (primarily through an established HFC network), and mobile services. While most of their business is concentrated in Europe, they also do a substantial amount of business, especially as a result of their recent acquisition of CWC, in Latin America and the Caribbean. Referred to as LiLAC, their markets include Chile, Panama, Puerto Rico, and essentially all of the Caribbean.On top of its suite of services, LiLAC has the dominant sub-sea fiber optic cable network in the region, which reduces the costs for the provision of its own services, while also serving as a valuable source of revenue from the provision of wholesale broadband capacity services, switch and routing capabilities, and local network services to telecom and broadband providers throughout the region.In order to highlight their Latin America and Caribbean business, Liberty launched the LiLAC tracking stock in July of 2015. It is expected to be spun off by the end of 2017.The cable business is one that confirms the adage, ""The early bird gets the worm."" Given the prohibitively high cost to lay cable, the player with the established cable network can virtually always provide the appropriate incentive to encourage other participants from not entering the market. If another provider attempts to enter, the incumbent can simply lower price and put new entrants out of business.As a result, new entrants are exceedingly rare. Even Google tried to disrupt the space in the U. S. with an initiative called ""Fiber"" in 2010. Over the last few months, they have, in essence, abandoned the project. Given the established and dominant cable networks that LiLAC possesses in the vast majority of its markets, LiLAC enjoys significant competitive advantages that are durable in nature.IP traffic in Latin America is expected to grow at a 21% CAGR over the next several years, with mobile data growth pegged at a 50% CAGR over the same period, due in large part to the growth of streaming video. 1 Logistically, the only reasonable way to handle this, as has already occurred in the U. S., is for data to travel over Wi-Fi networks, which receive their internet access from ISPs. It is for this reason that LiLAC, as the ISP with the most data capacity, is appropriately positioned to benefit from this trend.FMC, which is the trend towards a seamless connection between fixed and wireless networks, requires having fixed and mobile networks on behalf of the provider. This allows for the bundling of mobile, video, internet, and/or fixed-line telephony. The value proposition for businesses and consumers is clear. It offers fully integrated networks associated with a single provider, which is preferable to dealing with multiple networks and providers.It transfers mobile data organically to fixed networks, and offers steep price reductions relative to the sum of the prices of the individual services. In addition, the evidence indicates that FMC helps to both reduce customer churn and win new customers, especially from predominantly mobile providers. 2 LiLAC, as an FMC play with the best fixed broadband network in most of its markets, should both retain more of their customers and win share, especially because most of their competition is in the form of predominantly mobile providers.Broadband delivered via an HFC cable network is superior to the available/likely alternatives. It is generally ≥10x faster than the most common alternative, DSL, and its speeds, unlike DSL, are not contingent upon the distance users are from the signal/data provider. In addition, during peak hours, HFC networks are also far more likely to deliver advertised speeds than DSL. 3Relative to mobile broadband, while many outrageous claims are made about the promise of the networks, the speeds in practice still pale in comparison to HFC broadband 4 , and they are also unable to handle the traffic. While 5G offers more promise than previous mobile networks, implementing 5G networks appropriate to meet fixed broadband data demands is as expensive to build as the HFC cable networks that they would replace. 5Given that LiLAC is the #1 fixed broadband provider in 14 of their 20 markets, providing maximum speeds in the 160 to 1,000 Mbps range with their HFC network, it should win share in all verticals from competitors, drawing customers in with their superior broadband offering.Fixed broadband penetration in LiLAC markets is exceedingly low. While fixed broadband penetration in the U. S. is in the mid-to-high 80s, most of LiLAC's markets are in the mid 30s/low 40s range. In addition, the CAGRs for penetration growth from 2011 to 2016 for North America and Europe respectively are 1.8% and 2.9%, while the Latin America & Caribbean region has grown at a 6.9% CAGR over the same period. 6While affordability has been an issue limiting penetration growth in the Caribbean nations 7 , there is good reason to believe that this should be less of an issue over time. First, pricing has been improving relative to income for the Caribbean nations. 8 Second, growing data needs should increase the willingness of consumers to pay for broadband.While difficult to value, CWC's sub-sea fiber optic cable network is a wonderful asset that will generate growth for LiLAC over the long term. Over 97% of all global data traffic is carried through submarine fiber cables 9 , and CWC's 48,000 km network dwarfs Digicel's 3,100 km network. Given the prohibitive cost of laying sub-sea cable 10 , it is highly unlikely that Digicel will replicate CWC's network.As a result, Digicel will continue to pay CWC for wholesale broadband capacity along with switching and routing fees. In addition, it allows for CWC to enjoy a systematically lower cost structure in relation to Digicel because they don't have to pay these costs/fees themselves. Finally, the sub-sea network will allow CWC to benefit substantially from the expected growth in data traffic.While many in the M&A space promise great synergies but don't deliver, cable business synergies are generally easier to achieve, and LiLAC's management has a strong track record for achieving them. The ease in achieving these synergies is explained by a few different things. First, synergies related to content acquisition costs are delivered immediately and without execution risk because they are founded upon scale, which increases bargaining power with content providers who are reticent to lose viewers and the advertising revenues they generate.Second, because cable acquisitions are generally horizontal in nature, the acquirer has the structures in place to integrate acquisitions, making it easier to reduce front and back office costs. In addition, LiLAC's management has shown themselves to be conservative in the announcement of synergies, tending to outperform their guidance.Because they achieve these synergies, LiLAC management's intimations regarding rolling up the unconsolidated cable industry in the region provides for an appealing upside for LiLAC.LiLAC's management team is excellent and has a strong track record in the industry, having successfully created value for shareholders through excellence in operations and capital allocation (They recently announced a $300 million share repurchase plan due to the 50% decline in LiLAC's price.). Part of this is because LiLAC is one of the many John Malone businesses, as he is the Chairman of the Board. More importantly, Malone had the option of avoiding LiLAC share ownership in exchange for Liberty Global, but opted for LiLAC ownership 11 , which is a vote of confidence in favor of LiLAC.In terms of incentives, LiLAC insiders own significant portions of the company and are also incentivized predominantly with equity. 12 These mechanisms help to promote managements focused on delivering shareholder value over the long term.LiLAC's Chile operation, VTR, is arguably its best business. In conjunction with Chile being one of the best (if not the best) economies in Latin America, VTR's broadband business is dominant in the space, owing to its leading HFC network. Movistar's broadband business, relying predominantly on DSL delivered through copper lines, pales in comparison to VTR's. More importantly, future data needs ought to drive more share VTR's way. Given their bundling, increased broadband share should contribute to growing share in pay TV and mobile as well, especially given the less attractive bundled offerings of their competitors.Despite the general dysfunction of Puerto Rico and its economy, LiLAC's business, LCPR, maintains an excellent competitive position in Puerto Rico, as they enjoy 56% EBITDA margins. Being the only real HFC network broadband internet provider, it is the unequivocal market leader. Its product is substantially better than the offering of Claro, its DSL providing competitor.In fact, LCPR's low end offering is over 100 times faster than Claro's. As the market leader in Pay TV as well, there is good reason to believe that it will expand the gap between itself and its competitors, especially because its bundled offering, driven by its great broadband product, is something that should become increasingly desirable in relation to competitors in a more data-driven world.On the whole, CWC's competitive position is excellent, as it is the market leader in the vast majority of its markets. Due to the Columbus International acquisition, they have the strongest HFC network, and so frequently exhibit the best broadband offerings in the region. Through their bundling, they should continue to win share from their major competitor, Digicel, which is predominantly a mobile player. In addition to having a better product offering than Digicel, it is also the case that Digicel is currently struggling with too much leverage 13 , which has led to them shedding 25% of their workforce. 14This should halt Digicel in its tracks, which should leave CWC in a better position as it continues to invest in its own network. While concerns about Panama and the Caribbean economies are warranted, population growth in the region should lead to growth in the size of the pie in CWC markets.Assuming an 8x forward EV/EBITDA multiple (which is significantly lower than their peers which operate in fully penetrated markets, have dismal growth prospects, and lower margins), LiLAC trades at a multiple discount of 15%. Based on the 8x multiple, the implied equity value today is $34.11.This suggests a 51.5% upside (for Class C shares) due solely to the current undervaluation of the stock. While the Class C shares are more liquid (though the Class A shares are plenty liquid), the Class A shares trade at a 3.1% discount and have voting power. For these reasons, the Class A shares are the preferred investment vehicle. By year-end 2018, the model predicts a share price of $44.89, suggesting a 105.7% return.The General Weakness of LiLAC Economies: Simply stated, they are not as weak as some suggest, especially given population growth in the region, which should increase the market size for LiLAC. More importantly, LiLAC should be able to thrive, even in bad economic conditions, due to low fixed broadband penetration rates.(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the  .

s per the Zacks Industry categorization, the  industry falls under the broader  sector, which is one of the 16 Zacks sectors.The cable television industry, being one of the important industries in the U.S., has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators as well as online streaming service providers. Notably, the existing saturation and competition of the multi-channel U.S. video market has led to this loss. Online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe threat to cable TV operators due to cheap source of TV programming.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates. Moreover, two of major cable multi service operators (MSOs) in U.S., Comcast Corp.  and Charter Communications Inc.  , are planning to enter the domestic wireless industry.With such mixed prospects and strategic business ideas, let's have a look at the price performance of the cable television industry when compared with the S&P 500 index. The cable television industry has gained 18.72% outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 13.7%, over the past one year.Some of the major cable television companies, which are scheduled to release their second-quarter 2017 earnings, are Comcast Corp., Charter Communications, Shaw Communications Inc.  and Liberty Global plc.  .On Jun 28, Shaw Communications reported an impressive financial result for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended May 31, 2017) wherein the bottom line and top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications will report their results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Liberty Global plans to release its numbers on Aug 7,  . We look forward to see how these cable companies, which are yet to release their quarterly earnings, will perform.We have just entered the second-quarter earnings season with results from 30 S&P 500 members that account for 9.3% of the index's total market capitalization (based on our latest  article). Total earnings for these companies are up 13.8% from the year-ago period on 6% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and a similar portion beating revenue estimates.This week will see more than 200 companies reporting results, including 68 S&P 500 members. We can state that the second-quarter earnings season is off to a good start. By the end of this week, we will have results from almost one-fifth of the S&P 500 members.For second-quarter, we anticipate the prospects of companies to improve steadily. In fact, our latest scorecard projects that total Q2 earnings are expected to be up 6.6% from the year-ago period on 4.5% higher revenues. This would follow 13.3% increase in earnings growth from first quarter on 7.0% revenues growth, recording the highest increase in almost two years.We predict that second-quarter earnings of the Consumer Discretionary space to be down 1.6% in the quarter on 7.8% higher revenues in the year-ago period.Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Meanwhile, we also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Investors interested in cable TV stocks can watch out for the two cable companies that are expected to report their second-quarter 2017 numbers, before the opening bell on Jul 20.Headquartered in Canada,  is one of the largest integrated telecom operator in the region.

"alue investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Liberty Global has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.63, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.38. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts Liberty Global's current PE ratio way below its midpoint (which is 69.67) over the past five years.Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Cable Television industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 26.70. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Liberty Global has a P/S ratio of about 1.42. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.15 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.In aggregate, Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LBTYA a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 5.10, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 9.35. Clearly, LBTYA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though Liberty Global might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'C' and a Momentum score of 'B'. This gives Liberty Global a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'B'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past thirty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen one upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has deteriorated 55.1% in the past one month, while the full year estimate has fallen about 2.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Liberty Global is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 25% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. However, over the past one year, the Zacks Cable Television sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.At Zacks, we're mostly focused on short-term profit cycles, but the hottest of all technology mega-trends is starting to take hold... By last year, it was already generating $8 billion in global revenues.By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he stock market didn't post any major movements on Monday, with major benchmarks all finishing within 0.1% of the unchanged mark by the end of the trading session. Most investors had already expected that Emmanuel Macron would win Sunday's presidential election in France, and any early gains immediately after the results gave way to anticipation about the next potentially needle-moving event in the future. However, not all stocks managed to hold up as well as the overall market did, and  (NASDAQ: LBTYA) ,  (NASDAQ: HZNP) , and  (NASDAQ: SNCR) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.Shares of Liberty Global fell 8% after the company reported its first-quarter financial results. The European tracking stock for the media giant said the company managed to post a modest 2% rise in revenue, with substantial organic subscription gains of 244,300 led by especially strong new data subscription performance. Yet despite strong gains in the U.K. and Ireland, weaker results in Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria weighed on the unit's overall performance. Moreover, the company said that with respect to mobile in particular, weakness in both the Belgium and U.K. markets held Liberty Global back. Although the company expects the second half of the year to look more favorable than the first, Liberty Global investors appear to be nervous about the future. Moreover, given that the Latin American side of the business looked better in some ways than Europe, with its  (NASDAQ: LILA) tracking stock posting strong gains today, investors might have decided to move across the pond rather than sticking with the European growth story.Image source: Liberty Global.Horizon Pharma stock plummeted 35% in the wake of the company's first-quarter financial report. The biopharmaceutical specialist anounced that it suffered some unanticipated setbacks, with CEO Timothy Walbert saying that ""our primary care business unit performed well below our expectations."" Implementation of the company's contracting model with pharmacy benefit managers hasn't gone according to plan, and despite record net sales for its Krystexxa and Ravicti treatments, Horizon cut its revenue guidance by almost a fifth to just $1 billion-$1.035 billion. An even steeper cut of almost 40% on adjusted pre-tax operating earnings also reflects the sluggishness that Horizon has seen, and shareholders can only hope that conditions improve soon for the biopharma going forward.Finally, shares of Synchronoss Technologies dropped 9%. The mobile cloud company said that it would delay its release of its first-quarter financial report until May 15 after having initially been scheduled for a May 9 release date. Synchronoss said that given the replacement of both the chief executive officer and chief financial officer late last month, it needs more time to comply with accounting requirements both internally and externally. The request makes plenty of sense given the abruptness with which the new executives were named, but investors didn't seem ready to give Synchronoss the benefit of the doubt, especially after the nearly 70% stock-price decline that they've gone through since late last year.

The S&P 500 space is expected to end Q4 with a healthy growth rate of 7.4% and 3.9% for the bottom line and the top line, respectively. The readings are more favorable than those of Q3, wherein earnings expanded 3.7% and revenues grew merely 2.2%.As per the Zacks Industry categorization, the 'Media Sector' falls under the broader 'Consumer Discretionary' sector, one of the 16 Zacks sectors.Our last Earnings Preview stated that roughly 88.6% of the Consumer Discretionary stocks which have reported results have seen a 10.6% rise in earnings and a 12.9% upside in revenues on a year-over-year basis.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $47.17 per unit.With QQXT trading at a recent price near $42.75 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.33% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQXT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc (Symbol: XRAY), and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $35.23/share, the average analyst target is 21.85% higher at $42.93/share. Similarly, XRAY has 17.03% upside from the recent share price of $56.91 if the average analyst target price of $66.60/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ORLY to reach a target price of $306.71/share, which is 15.28% above the recent price of $266.07. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, XRAY, and ORLY:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $47.17 per unit.With QQXT trading at a recent price near $42.75 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.33% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQXT's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc (Symbol: XRAY), and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $35.23/share, the average analyst target is 21.85% higher at $42.93/share. Similarly, XRAY has 17.03% upside from the recent share price of $56.91 if the average analyst target price of $66.60/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ORLY to reach a target price of $306.71/share, which is 15.28% above the recent price of $266.07. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, XRAY, and ORLY:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@How The Pieces Add Up: QQXT Headed For $47@2017-01-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-pieces-add-qqxt-headed-47-2017-01-26
ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (Symbol: VXF) where we have detected an approximate $19.9 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.4% decrease week over week (from 47,026,252 to 46,830,252). Among the largest underlying components of VXF, in trading today Tesla Inc (Symbol: TSLA) is down about 0.8%, Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYA) is up about 0.9%, and Las Vegas Sands Corp (Symbol: LVS) is up by about 1.2%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of VXF, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, VXF's low point in its 52 week range is $80.36 per share, with $102.03 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $101.87. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: VXF, TSLA, LBTYA, LVS@2017-04-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-vxf-tsla-lbtya-lvs-2017-04-26
"enchmarks closed in the red on the final trading session of 2016 after investors indulged in profit taking. Major indexes registered their third consecutive session of declines for the first time since Nov 4. Additionally, Apple's shares fell following reports that the tech giant will reduce iPhone production, which weighed on the tech sector and eventually on the broader markets.All the three key U.S. indexes also posted weekly losses but reported monthly, quarterly and yearly gains. Encouraging economic data, Donald Trump's surprise electoral victory and Fed rate hike in December boosted markets for 2016. While the S&P 500 registered a strong increase in 2016, both the Dow and Nasdaq posted their best yearly gains since 2013 and 2014, respectively.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's  article.During the last session of 2016, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.3%, to close at 19,762.60. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% to close at 2,238.83. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 5,383.12, losing 0.9%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) advanced 5% to settle at 14.04. A total of around 5.6 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.8 billion shares. Decliners outpaced advancing stocks on the NYSE. For 53% stocks that declined, 44% advanced.Investors indulged in profit taking on some of the top-performing sectors of 2016, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. Additionally, shares of Apple Inc. (  ) decreased 0.8% following reports that the company is reducing production of latest iPhone line by nearly 10% during the ongoing quarter.Declines in Apple led the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) to fall 0.8% and emerge as the second worst performer among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings including Facebook, Inc. (  ) and Microsoft Corporation (  ) fell 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see For the week, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined 0.9%, 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively. After starting last week with gains on the back of record consumer confidence and stable home price data, key indexes fell for three consecutive trading days. Light trading and profit booking by investors weighed on stock markets. Moreover, rise in crude inventories and decline in pending home sales also had a negative impact on investor sentiment.For the month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 3.3%, 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively. Benchmarks ended the month in the green backed by a Trump-led rally. Expectations from Trump's economic policies along with Fed's decision to raise rates in December continued to improve markets. Additionally, the central bank also indicated that rates might be increased further over the coming years. Further, strong manufacturing and services data, solid jobs and housing data and better-than-expected expansion in the U.S. economy during third quarter also boosted stocks last month.For the quarter, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 7.9%, 3.3% and 1.3%, respectively. Benchmarks ended in the green for the quarter, buoyed by gains in sectors which are projected to benefit immensely from a Trump administration. Also, OPEC's decision to cut oil production for the first time since 2008 added to the euphoria, while holiday season sales gained ground.For the year, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 13.4%, 9.5% and 7.5%, respectively. Markets survived early blues from slowing growth in China's economy as well as the ""Brexit"" which occurred mid of 2016. Some of the key factors that contributed to these strong yearly gains for major benchmarks are Trump-induced rally, Fed's rate hike, improved domestic economy and  rally.Trump's promises during his campaign, which include deregulation, tax cuts and expansion in infrastructure spending led investors to believe that Trump's presidency will give a significant boost to the U.S. economy. Fed indicated faster pace of rate hike this year, which along with encouraging economic data and crude output cut agreement by major oil producing nations also boosted investor sentiment for the year.The long-awaited proposed joint venture (JV) between the units of Liberty Global Plc.

"he telecom industry saw strong performances by most of the key stocks last week. A few developments even made to the headlines.DISH Network Corp.  , the second largest satellite TV operator in the U.S. started off the year impressively. According to a recent report by The Business Journal, DISH Network's subsidiary, AirTV launched its latest streaming device, AirTV Player, a 4K Android-based streaming device which supports ultra HD (high definition) and is pre-loaded with Netflix Inc.  , SlingTV and YouTube apps and that work with an over-the-air antenna for broadcast TV. Hence, AirTV marks ""a single unified"" platform for on-demand streaming, Internet TV, and over-the-air (OTA) local channels.The year 2016 ended with a slew of positive developments for Dutch consumers as well as businesses. According to a recent report by The Business Journal, the long-awaited merger between the Dutch units of Liberty Global Plc.  and Vodafone Group Plc.  finally materialized on Dec 31, 2016. The two companies announced that Liberty Global Europe Holding B.V. and Vodafone International Holdings B.V. have formed a joint venture (JV) with equal partnership.Meanwhile, according to a recent report by The Business Journal, U.S. telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc.  plans to end the promotional offer for its DirecTV Now package. The 'Go Big' package of AT&T's DirecTV Now, which offers more than 100 channels for $35 per month including live and on-demand programming as well as premium add-on options, is slated to end on Jan 9. AT&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Per The Wall Street Journal report, Comcast Corp.  , a leading cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S., finally settled its 13-month old scuffle with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.  over carriage of the YES Network in New York City. Comcast signed a new pact with Twenty-First Century Fox on Jan 1. Moreover, Comcast and Charter Communications Inc.  have decided to extend negotiations to find an agreeable solution regarding the existing carrier deal, which has ended on Dec 31, 2016.Outside the U.S., Spanish telecom behemoth Telefonica SA  has been charged EUR 6.23 million (around $6.5 million) and EUR 30,000 ($31,304) by the governments of Andalucia and Madrid, respectively on grounds of its price hike for the Fusion package.The fines follow the filing of complaints by the Spanish consumer protection authority, FACUA.

However, aggressive pricing related to non-applicability of data caps for the service in wireless plans may be subjected to net neutrality scrutiny. Moreover, the telco's OTT service was charged on anti-competitive grounds by U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The company's recent zero-rating practices and DirecTV plans also seem to suppress competition and thus violate the FCC's net neutrality rules. (read more:  )4. On Dec 27, 2016, Telefonica announced price hike plans for Fusion, effective Feb 2017. However, the price hike has been justified with an increase in the mobile data allowance. Fusion customers with two or four mobile lines will have to pay an extra EUR 5 every month. At the same time, the amount of data included will increase from 6 GB to 16 GB for plans with two lines and from 12 GB to 32 GB with four lines. This offer is likely to give tough competition to the latest offer of 24 GB from Orange S.A. (read more:  .)5. The decision of Comcast to bring back Fox News is a good one. This is because Fox News is presently one of the nation's largest pay-TV distributors with over 20 million subscribers. The Fox news network is at its peak in terms of ratings and number of viewers in its 20-year history, courtesy of the updates on the latest presidential election. Comcast officials also expressed their content on the success in bringing back the YES Network after negotiations and deals that should favor both companies.

Over the last five trading sessions, share price movement of most of the major telecom stocks witnessed a positive trend barring Comcast. Vodafone gained a significant 4.49% in the same time frame. However, over the last six months, the price performance of most telecom stocks depicts a mixed trend. Among the stocks that gained significantly are Sprint (95.77%), T-Mobile US (36.13%) and DISH Network (18.85%). On the other hand, Vodafone lost 19.41% in the same time period.We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week.

As if all of that wasn't bad enough, the company's submission of a hopeful blockbuster drug -- Sarilumab -- was rejected by the FDA due to manufacturing issues.Given all of that, perhaps it shouldn't come as much of a surprise to see that shares declined more than 5% year-to-date.Image Source: Getty Images.Thankfully, Liberty has been using its ample financial resources to take advantage of its depressed share price. The company has been leveraging up its balance sheet in order to buy back its stock, retiring nearly $700 million worth of its stock in the second quarter alone. The company has also announced plans to repurchase another $3.0 billion worth of its shares by the end of next year. Down the road, the company's expanded service area and product offering could help to keep its top-line in growth mode, so perhaps it wouldn't be all that surprising to see shares start to rebound in 2017.While Buffett has had a handful of clunkers in 2016, it is worth remembering that these losing stocks only represents a tiny fraction of Berkshire's total holdings. Thus, these faltering stocks have barely put a dent in the company's overall performance. In fact, Berkshire overall has done  in 2016, which is why shares have risen more than 26% since January.

n Dec 12, we issued an updated research report on  , a leading cable MSO with operations in Europe and Latin America.The launch of DOCSIS 3.1 network services, the joint venture with Vodafone Group Plc.  in the Netherlands, the acquisition of UTV Ireland TV stations from ITV, and the takeover of Cable & Wireless are expected to drive growth at Liberty Global.

Notably, Multimedia Polska is the third largest cable TV operator in Poland. The all-cash transaction is likely to be completed in the next one year, subject to customary regulatory clearances.In Sep 2016, Liberty Global reached a long-term agreement with Netflix Inc.  wherein the latter will be allowed to offer its content on the former's cable network. The service will be available in 30 countries in which Liberty Global operates, starting from the Netherlands and gradually expanding to other regions. Note that Netflix, at the beginning of November, announced its integration into Comcast Corp.'s  cloud-based managed video delivery X1 platform.Shares of Liberty Global have underperformed the Zacks-categorized Cable TV industry on a year-to-date basis due to multiple headwinds that have hurt the stock this year. The stock has lost 29.70%, lagging the industry's growth of 16.35% over the same period.Liberty Global's predominant operation in Europe is a major concern because of the prevalence of recessionary pressure, debt crisis and low per capita income in several European countries. Further, stiff competition in the video, broadband, fixed-line telephony and mobile services business and foreign exchange rate risks remain major dampeners.Liberty Global's top line and EBITDA growth may become volatile in the near future, or may be weighed down by the maturing Western European operations, which account for a majority of the company's total revenue. Moreover, the company's recent acquisitions may certainly give rise to integration risks.We believe the company's merger and acquisition plans bode well for its long-term growth. However, the multiple headwinds that it faces hurt the stock and have been the reason behind Liberty Global carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

able TV behemoth  and satellite TV operator  jointly announced that the latter's virtual MPVD (Multichannel Video Programming Distributor) platform, Sling TV, will be integrated into the cable multi-service operator's (MSO) cloud-based, managed video delivery platform, X1.The X1 platform is an all-in-one service which offers live TV, on-demand content, cloud DVR and video streaming. The platform includes a voice remote control as well as Spanish user-interface. Sling TV services will be made available on Comcast's X1 platform at prices consistent with current offers on other platforms coupled with different options such as language-specific add-ons for customer comfort. Sling TV's multicultural packages start at $10 a month. Also, more than 425 Sling TV channels will be integrated into X1.This integration will allow Comcast's X1 customers access numerous multicultural programs and channels. The companies are working to add Sling TV to X1 and will provide further details when the content is available to customers.Cable TV providers like Comcast have been facing considerable pressure due to growing demand for over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services, which has led to increased cord-cutting in recent years. People have been dumping expensive cable TV plans and shifting toward unbundled packages. To counter this competitive threat, cable MSOs recently started launching their own Internet TV offerings. Nonetheless, these offerings could not match the ease and feasibility of the OTT service. This encouraged smaller cable operator to partner with video streaming providers for offering the latter's service through a regular set-top box. Toward this end, in the beginning of Nov 2016, both Comcast and Netflix Inc.  jointly announced the Netflix integration into the X1 platform. Going forward, we expect to see more such partnerships between cable TV operators and OTT service providers. Note that Netflix recently signed another collaborated with cable giant Liberty Global plc  to offer its content on Liberty Global's network.This alliance marks the debut of Sling TV's multicultural programming on Comcast X1 platform and hence opens up the scope for Comcast to better serve its diversified customers around the globe.Multicultural consumers make the fastest growing segment in the U.S., increasing 2.3 million per year. Meanwhile, census projections show that this segment is poised to become a majority by 2044. Hence, Comcast is looking forward to providing culturally relevant content for diverse audiences and language groups, including Arabic, Chinese, Urdu and more.DISH Network's efforts to diversify its business model from being a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet TV operator should help the company counter competitive threat from low-cost video streaming operators. The company is poised to benefit from its Internet TV service - Sling TV - which offers services at a reasonable rate.Comcast is also striving to gain a leading position in the video programming segment. |  | Both DISH and Comcast currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

he year 2016 ended with some good tidings for Dutch consumers and businesses. According to a recent report by  , the long-awaited proposed joint venture (JV) between the units of  and  to merge their Dutch operations finally materialized on Dec 31.The two companies announced that Liberty Global Europe Holding B.V. and Vodafone International Holdings B.V. have formed a 50:50 JV. The JV is valued at €3.5 billion (US$ 3.68 billion) after deducting €7.3 billion in debt held by Ziggo, the brand name of Liberty Global's Dutch operation.As agreed upon, Liberty Global will receive approximately €2.2 billion (US$2.32 billion) and Vodafone will receive €6 million (US$6.31 million) in cash payments post closure.The total cash proceeds came in at over €2.7 billion (US$2.84 billion) for Liberty Global and approximately €0.9 billion for Vodafone, considering the cash generated by both company's respective Dutch operations from Feb 2016 through Dec 31, 2016. The companies aim to deploy this capital to drive long-term growth and investor returns.The deal was first announced in Feb 2016, wherein it was decided that Vodafone will pay €1 billion (approximately $1.12 billion) in cash to Liberty Global to bring the valuation of each of their local units on par.The joint venture - VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V. - will have 4.2 million video subscribers and 5.3 million wireless phone subscribers. The JV will operate under both the Vodafone and the Ziggo brands and will create a nationwide integrated communications provider with 7.1 million homes passed by the fiber-rich broadband network of Ziggo Group Holding B.V. and the nationwide 4G mobile coverage of Vodafone's Dutch operation.VodafoneZiggo is expected to be an integrated provider of converged communications services in the Netherlands with a full suite of market-leading TV, broadband, fixed-line and mobile products on day one of the JV.Following all post-closing payments, VodafoneZiggo will have gross debt of €10 billion. Moreover, the JV will distribute 100% of its available cash to shareholders of both sides, subject to a minimum operational cash balance. The JV is also expected to undertake periodic recapitalisations subject to market and operating conditions, to maintain its target leverage ratio.The deal will allow the joint-venture partners to offer bundles of cable television, broadband and mobile services. The combined Vodafone-Liberty Global entity should pose a formidable challenge to key players like Royal KPN NV and T-Mobile Netherlands of Deutsch Telekom.We are rather impressed with the merger and acquisition plans of Liberty Global. Apart from the JV with Vodafone, the launch of DOCSIS 3.1 network services, the acquisition of UTV Ireland TV stations from ITV, the long-term agreement with Netfix Inc.  and the takeover of Cable & Wireless are expected to drive growth at Liberty Global.We believe the above tailwinds have resulted in Liberty Global's current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In spite of such efforts, shares of Liberty Global have underperformed the Zacks categorized  on in the past one year, due to multiple headwinds that hurt the stock last year. The stock lost 26.73% lagging the industry's growth of 18.35% over the same period.Another well-placed stock in the telecommunication sector is Liberty Media Corp.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"he telecom industry experienced a good run on the bourses last week as most of the key stocks traded in the green. The U.S. telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has reduced the clearing target price of the ongoing 600 MHz low-band wireless spectrum auction, popularly known as the Incentive Auction. At present, the regulatory body is going through the stage 2 of the second part of the auction.In stage 2, the FCC reduced the event clearing spectrum size to 114 MHz instead of 126 MHz fixed earlier. Consequently, the auction clearing target price has also been lowered substantially to $54.6 billion from the initial target price of $86.4 billion. The FCC has received as many as 62 applications for the second part of the Incentive Auction. All the bidders have made upfront payments.Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, to review the previous ruling regarding a data throttling charge issued by the FTC against the U.S. telecom behemoth AT&T Inc.  . Data throttling basically means data traffic blocking and slowing any data traffic once customers hit certain usage thresholds in a month.In a separate development, AT&T initiated direct roaming mobile interconnection services in Cubastarting Oct 18.AT&T's customers will now be able to connect through talk, text and data while in Cuba at price rates of $3 per minute on the phone, 50 cents per SMS text, $1.30 per MMS text and $2.05 per MB of data.U.S. telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc.  plans to close seven call centers across five states that may lead to job loss of 3200 employees. The company deems the decision as a difficult but necessary one. Verizon intends to realign its real estate assets and customer service operations to make the optimum use of its call centers in other locations. Verizon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see At the cable TV front, Charter Communications Inc.  selected ARRIS International plc.  as its vendor partner for its next-generation WorldBox 2.0 set-top box. Initiated in early 2015, WorldBox 2.0 is Charter Communications' innovative hybrid IP/QAM video platform which is built to offer traditional and cloud-based user interfaces, content, and new video features to its subscribers.Leading wireless chipset manufacturer Qualcomm Inc.  is leaving no stone unturned to make good use of the upcoming 5G network opportunity. Recently, Qualcomm's subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., made an announcement regarding the launch of the world's first 5G modem Snapdragon X50 and gigabit modem Snapdragon X16 LTE.Outside the U.S., Liberty Global plc.  , a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe and Latin & Central America, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the cable business of Multimedia Polska S.A. for a consideration of approximately $760 million. For video service, Multimedia Polska competes with UPC Poland and Vivendi SA and for Internet service, the company's main competitor is Orange SA  .Read the last  .1. The FCC was initially hopeful of completing the Incentive Auction by the end of the third quarter of 2016. However, industry watchers are now anticipating it to be more prolonged and it is likely to continue till early 2017. Some industry watchers have also predicted that telecom operators might need around 70 MHz to 80 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz bands instead of the total freed up 126 MHz airwaves. In such a scenario, the FCC might have to conduct another round of reverse auction for a reduced volume of spectrum at lower prices. (read more:  .)2. For the FTC case, AT&T hasn't denied that it had throttled data for some users. However, the company defended itself citing that an exception is in place for common carriers. In Oct 2014, AT&T was a common carrier for landline phone and mobile voice service, but not for mobile Internet access. The FCC reclassified mobile Internet as a common carrier service only after adopting the Net Neutrality Rules. Notably, the FCC also slapped a fine of $100 million on AT&T for a similar reason in Jun 2015. The company has filed a response, which is still under review by the telecom regulator.

Under Obama's administration, new Cuban policy regulations, which have been approved by the Treasury and Commerce departments, aided the U.S. telecommunications industry to gain initial exemptions from the existing embargo to invest in Cuba. We believe, in the long-term, Cuba may be a boon for the U.S. telecom operators. (read more:  .)4. Notably, Charter Communications has entered into a share warrant agreement with ARRIS. Per the deal, Charter Communications has the right to purchase up to 6 million shares of ARRIS' stock before the end of 2018. ARRIS will make certain number of shares available to Charter Communications only after the cable MSO purchases a specific volume of ARRIS' products and services, specifically that under Network & Cloud segment products.

Over the last five trading sessions, share price movement of major telecom stocks was positive barring China Mobile. DISH (4.20%) and Sprint (3.60%) gained significant value in the last five trading sessions. Likewise, over the last six months, the price performance of most telecom stocks was predominantly positive. Among the stocks that gained considerably were Sprint (81.05%), DISH (21.13%) and T-Mobile US (17.86%). On the other hand, America Movil and Vodafone lost 23.10% and 17.53%, respectively, over the same time frame.We expect a lot of activity in the telecom sector over the next week as big names like Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile US and Comcast are slated to release their quarterly results. In addition, leading wireless towers operators like Crown Castle International and American Tower will also release their results. Non-US telecom bigwigs such as Orange, America Movil, Telefonica, Chunghwa Telecom, Grupo Televisa and Telefonica Brasil will come up with their quarterly results as well.

 , a leading cable TV operator in Europe and Latin America, is scheduled to report third-quarter 2016 results on Nov 3, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted an impressive positive earnings surprise of 360.00%. Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 202.22%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Liberty Global's operation in Europe is a major concern in itself. This is because recessionary pressure, debt crisis and low per capita income are some of the major issues plaguing several European markets. This may impede customer spending on pricey high-speed communication services. Additionally, the markets for video, broadband, fixed-line telephony and mobile services are highly competitive and fast evolving with technological advancements and innovation. Hence, to keep up with the pace, the company has to bear the related expenses of launching the latest technologies. Further, foreign exchange rate risks and integration risks are other major dampeners.Nevertheless, Liberty Global is expected to benefit from its widespread adoption of broadband and data services in the form of its new launch of DOCSIS 3.1 network services in 2017. Further, the merger and acquisition plans of the company seem impressive. The 50-50 joint venture with Vodafone Group plc  in the Netherlands, the acquisition of UTV Ireland TV stations from ITV, agreement with Netfix and the takeover of Cable & Wireless Communications should drive growth at Liberty Global. Notably, the company has almost 6.1 million WiFi access points in its European footprint and plans to increase its WiFi access points to over 10.0 million in 2016.In Sep 2016, Liberty Global reached a long-term agreement with Netflix Inc.  wherein the latter will be allowed to offer its content on the former's cable network. The service will be available in 30 of the countries Liberty Global operates in, starting from the Netherlands and gradually expanding to other regions.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. Liberty Global has an earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 1 cent.

 , a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe and Latin & Central America, recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the cable business of Multimedia Polska S.A. for a consideration of approximately $760 million. Notably, Multimedia Polska is the third largest cable TV operator in Poland. The all-cash transaction is likely to be completed in next one year subject to customary regulatory clearances.Liberty Global already has a strong presence in Poland which operates under the UPC Poland brand. For video service, Multimedia Polska competes with UPC Poland and Vivendi SA and for Internet service, the company's main competitor is Orange SA  . Liberty Global will not be acquiring Multimedia Polska's other businesses like insurance, gas and energy operations.As of Jun 30, 2016, UPC Poland passed 3.1 million homes, or around 20% of total households in Poland, serving 1.4 million unique customers who subscribed to 2.9 million cable subscription services. At the end of second-quarter 2016, Multimedia Polska passed 1.6 million homes mainly through its hybrid fiber-coaxial cable network, serving 832,000 unique customers who subscribed to 1.4 million subscription services consisting of 643,000 video, 491,000 broadband and 241,000 telephony RGUs. In addition, Multimedia Polska had 54,000 mobile subscribers at Jun 30, 2016.Earlier in Aug 2016, the European Union Competition Commission (EC) approved the proposed 50-50 joint venture (JV) between Liberty Global and Vodafone Group plc.  in the Netherlands after both companies jointly offered some concessions.The companies hope to achieve annual cost savings of about €280 million from the merger of their businesses. This JV will allow them to offer bundles of cable TV, high-speed broadband and mobile phone services to their combined 15 million customers. Leading telecom operators in Europe, such as Deutsch Telekom and BT Group plc.  are also looking at options to offer bundled services to their customers.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The need to remain connected is essentially human. An era of digitization and technology is built on this need. It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom space in an otherwise tough environment.With the global telecom industry continuously evolving, companies in the league are fighting it out to stay ahead in the competition. The latest in the league is the newly launched DOCSIS 3.1 technology.DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was specifically designed to be the cable TV industry's answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators. The old-generation DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest Internet speed available in the market.The next-generation DOCSIS 3.1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3.0. Theoretically, while DOCSIS 3.0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 comes with several operational benefits.The technology is also backward compatible, allowing the present hybrid fiber-coaxial cable lines to allow such high Internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem. Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth, backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3.1. This allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed Gigabit broadband to customers, without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs, unlike FTTH providers. This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs.In the U.S., the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ:  -  ) is already deploying DOCSIS 3.1 network in several markets.

"EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It is used as a proxy of the ""cash flows"" a business produces before paying debt holders, governments and providing for capital investment. By its very definition, EBITDA excludes probable expenses and therefore overstates the amount of cash flow which is actually available to management for free allocation.Liberty Global (  ,  ,  ) Chairman John Malone , faced with the capital intensive and competitive needs of the early cable industry, was likely the first to introduce EBITDA to Wall Street. Having achieved a total return of 30% annually between 1973 to 1999, his example is worth examining. Net income, for one thing, fails to capture value creation in survival of the fattest growth industries. EBITDA serves as a 'capital structure neutral' walking stick when net income, or other measures, do not reflect the value being accumulated or earned.It is said that EBITDA came of age during the leveraged buyout era of the 1980s since using it as a measure of ""repayment capacity"" allows for greater leverage. The profitless and sometimes revenueless dot-com boom helped solidified its popularity. Famed value investors like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger and Seth Klarman opined that EBITDA isn't actually a cash flow measure and that it greatly overstates cash flow. One Berkshire Hathaway (  ) (  ) shareholder letter notes that Buffett literally ""  "" at its mere mention.A major use of EBITDA today is in corporate valuations. To use it, one needs an academic idea called ""capital structure irrelevance"" which states that the total value of a firm is independent of how that firm is financed. This idea is crucial to the now common practice of capitalizing flows of EBITDA to arrive at an enterprise value - that is, as in EV/EBITDA. This particular part of the story, however, requires a future article.Let's take a look at a history of this prominent non-GAAP measure.Old accounting books frequently call net income ""residual."" This term better illustrates what net income is - it is the residual amount carried over between periods on the accounting books. It is a reconciliation figure, period to period, for accounting net worth or book value, i.e., shareholder's equity.Sometimes the competitive dynamic of an industry is ""survival of the fattest."" The biggest will win due to a virtuous cycle of market power through scale. In such a situation it is competitively rational to maximize growth, using up any ""residual"" which might otherwise exist by spending it on growth projects. In this type of competitive dynamic, management would be rational to maximize growth spending by minimizing tax, by minimizing net income.Such was the situation faced by John Malone when he joined debt laden cable company TCI in 1973. The term EBITDA was already in the corporate management literature, for instance, in the 1966 textbook  but it doesn't appear to have been used in security analysis. The debt heavy TCI needed to convince analysts to ignore accounting earnings, which were already poor, and argued that those failed to capture the value the firm was creating. The company need to finance its operations with debt, so it could continue to purchase other cable companies and to lay more cable. Malone would say later:No doubt for reasons of accessing capital, he began advocating EBITDA as a proxy for repayment power - it allowed the ""cash flow"" of the company to appear healthy, even with losses and large capital spending. ""There is a big difference between creating wealth and reporting income,"" he would say. The trick, for him, wasn't net income per say but owning appreciating assets which were then highly leveraged at as low a rate as possible.Most would argue the next step in the story of EBITDA is in leveraged buyouts - but the leverage buyout era didn't necessarily need EBITDA. The small 1981 Gibson Greeting Cards leveraged buyout, regarded by some as the starting gun of the era, was consummated because its purchase price was a discount to book value and the lenders looked to good old liquidating value rather than cash flow.It is said that EBITDA began to be used with depressed and distressed companies in the unusual case of near bankruptcy. Later by banks to evaluate the maximum short-term cash generating ability of a company. Then, the typical story would go, it was applied to capital intensive firms and eventually to all kinds of companies.As its popularity increased, it began to enter the public discussion. Buffett  disapprovingly of EBITDA in 1989. The first mention of the term by the New York Times appears in 1991 - it is referred to as the most ""liberal definition"" of cash flows used by leveraged, money losing companies. Seth Klarman  about it critically in 1991. With increasing usage throughout the 1990s, its importance in financial culture was crystallized. As is natural in the stock market, the increasing cultural fixation with EBITDA was then exploited in the 2002 Worldcom accounting scandal, the largest financial scandal prior to Madoff.Till the present, its frequency of usage continued to grow, taking some mind share from official GAAP bottom line - net income.So how did we get here culturally? The incentives were such that corporate management encouraged it and analysts played along in the social dance. Managements simply made a bigger deal of EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, and convinced the banks to make loan covenants out of it. The phenomenon of many managements ""making a bigger deal"" of non-GAAP should sound familiar to investors today. After all, the SEC recently felt it necessary to give more disclosure  regarding non-GAAP. See my article on  for further discussion.Coming back to John Malone, it is possible that necessity was the mother of invention, or that he is merely the exception which proves the rule, but it is still clear he was creating value without profits. And EBITDA was an attempt to measure this. The traditional value investor critique from Buffett-Munger-Klarman is simple and still correct: it isn't actually cash flow because it excludes necessary expenses and capital reinvestment.What these critics may be missing is that GAAP losses do not mean ""no value."" GAAP losses just mean no ""residual"" carried over between periods under accrual accounting. A loss is a very a different fact depending on the circumstances of a specific company. According to Ben Graham, losses are a qualitative, not a quantitative, fact. Losses put a question mark over the business model itself - will they ever be profitable in the future? - whereas from profits one can derive a cash flow schedule from which to value the firm.Some uses of EBITDA simply do not seem as useful as their older, more traditional counterparts. Discussing these will showcase the well known shortcomings of EBITDA. For instance:Both metrics ignore the fact that many businesses need constant capital expenditures and increasing levels of working capital for growth - not to mention that interest and taxes are about as certain of expenses as it gets. Therefore, using EBITDA as a meter stick for ""debt repayment capacity"" nearly always overstates the case and can lead to dangerous conclusions. The fact that Malone, with his 30% annual returns, targeted a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5 should count as an exception - his company paid little in tax and was notoriously skimpy on capex.There are a few ways to illustrate the problem with EBITDA when it comes to debt. If we assumed, for instance, that Company A has net income of $100, fully converted to cash flow, and has debt of $500, you can say the following:With EBITDA, one cannot make claims about the time it would take to pay off the debt. It simply doesn't proxy for cash flows which are available for debt repayment. That is, it doesn't proxy for internally generated cash flows available for altering the capital structure.The only figure which measures internal cash flow available to alter capital structure is free cash flow.A further way of illustrating the above issues with EBITDA is to consider a firm which cannot raise money externally. If this company cannot raise capital externally, then only internal cash flows can be used to pay debt, pay dividends, buyback stock or invest in the company.Internally generated cash is called ""cash from operations"" in GAAP - it is net income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital demands. Subtracting necessary capital expenditures from this and you are left with the cash which is available to freely alter the capital structure, that is, the cash which is free for debt repayment or anything else management wishes to do.The above is, of course, the definition of free cash flow, widely considered to be a net income substitute in non-financial firms:Using Google's ngram viewer, you can contrast the popularity of the two metrics:Further breaking down EBITDA, it is clear why EBITDA ""cash flows"" cannot be considered free:
  
The greatest importance of this distinction is that free cash flow, by definition, is the cash which is internally generated and can be freely used to alter the capital structure of the company. This is the purpose of the term ""free."" This makes the best calculation of ""years to pay off debt"" as:Debt / avg. free cash flow = years to pay off debtIn most real life situations, a company with a debt to EBITDA of 3 cannot pay off its debt in three years whereas a company with a debt to free cash flow of 3 potentially could. This signals that Debt to EBITDA is nearly non-sensical under its own terms since, depending on the scale of interest and capital expenditures, a debt to EBITDA of 3 As mentioned, the cultural focus on EBITDA played a notable role in the 2002 Worldcom accounting scandal. Here is the Wall Street Journal's take from 2002:The scandal generated some soul searching regarding EBITDA among analysts but, as history shows, few hearts were changed. The problem back then is similar to the problem today - non-GAAP measures were being accepted by analysts without critical reflection.It is also worth meditating on how EBITDA is being used today, not simply by managements wishing to communicate in non-GAAP,  . This latter process requires a theory where one can value bonds and stocks at the same time using a single discount rate. This, however, needs to be treated at length and requires breaking the subject into a separate article. Please stay tuned for part two in coming weeks.The old line value investors missed something in their critique of EBITDA. They ignore that market share gains in a survival of the fattest industry dynamic is a form of value creation - even if there is no ""residual"" period to period. EBITDA can give a performance picture when traditional metrics are negative.Yet it isn't a measure of the cash which is available to alter the capital structure - this indicates that the perception that it is ""cash flow"" is overstated. This can have serious implications when it is used to measure repayment capacity as in the popular metrics of debt-to-EBITDA or EBITDA-to-interest. These metrics are so abstracted from the capital structure and capital requirements of a business that, in my view, they are more trouble than they are worth.

ajor cable MSOs (multi service operators) across the world are gradually deploying high-speed Wideband network based on the DCOSIS 3.1 technology. The latest addition in this list is  , a leading cable MSO with operations in Europe and Latin America. The company recently announced that it will launch its first DOCSIS 3.1 service in 2017.DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was specifically designed to be the cable TV industry's answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators. The currently available DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest Internet speed available in the market.The DOCSIS 3.1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3.0. Theoretically, while DOCSIS 3.0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 comes with several operational benefits.The technology is also backward compatible, allowing the present hybrid fiber-coaxial cable lines to allow such high Internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem. Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth, backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3.1, which allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed Gigabit broadband to customers, without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs, unlike FTTH providers. This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs.Recently, increased cord cutting has put pressure on the pay TV industry, leaving them looking for alternatives for revenue generation. DOCSIS 3.1 is facilitating cable MSOs to explore new markets. The slump in the basic video market is being compensated by broadband services in the cable telephony and high-speed Internet markets. Escalating demand for TVEverywhere (watching movie on the Internet) has made DOCSIS 3.1 essential for cable MSOs. In addition, demand for online gaming and downloading of various multimedia applications have also increased.In the U.S., leading cable MSO, Comcast Corp.  is aggressively deploying DOCSIS 3.1 networks. Meanwhile, the DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem market is expected to become increasingly competitive with the presence of large players like ARRIS International plc  and Cisco Systems Inc.  .Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ibertyGlobal plc.  , one of the largest cable TV providers in the world, has reached a long-term agreement with Netflix Inc.  wherein the latter will be allowed to offer its content on the former's cable network. The service will be available in 30 of the countries Liberty Global operates in, starting from the Netherlands and gradually expanding to other regions. Notably, Liberty Global already offers Netflix content to U.K. customers via Virgin Media - a company that was acquired by Liberty Global in 2016.Cable TV providers like Liberty Global and Comcast Corporation  have been facing considerable challenges from the over-the-top (OTT) video streaming business model which has led to increased cord cutting in recent years. Notably, people have been shifting toward unbundled packages, dumping the expensive cable TV plans. However, we may see increased partnerships between cable TV operators and OTT service providers in the future. Interestingly, this is Netflix's second collaboration with a cable operator, after Comcast's X1 video system deal in July this year.Combining Netflix's attractive content with its own cable TV system will help Liberty Global's cable TV services gain more viewers. Moreover, such a partnership will prove beneficial to Netflix as well. The OTT market is slowly becoming a much contested space as an increasing number of telecom operators are coming up with video streaming services like Verizon Communication Inc.'s  'Go90'. Thus, we believe that this partnership is a win for both companies. | Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the ProShares RAFI Long/Short ETF (Symbol: RALS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $43.05 per unit.With RALS trading at a recent price near $38.96 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.51% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RALS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYA), NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI), and Constellium N.V. (Symbol: CSTM). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $32.12/share, the average analyst target is 38.59% higher at $44.51/share. Similarly, NXPI has 27.81% upside from the recent share price of $83.55 if the average analyst target price of $106.78/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CSTM to reach a target price of $8.84/share, which is 25.95% above the recent price of $7.02. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, NXPI, and CSTM:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Look Under The Hood: RALS Has 11% Upside@2016-09-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/look-under-hood-rals-has-11-upside-2016-09-15
wo months after  announced that it would make the Netflix Inc.  app available on its X1 platform, the cable giant has decided to roll out a beta version of the service within the next few days. Instead of merely introducing the app, Comcast plans to integrate Netflix into the X1 system, featuring voice controls and search results among other things.Cable TV providers like Comcast have been facing considerable pressure due to growing demand for over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services, which has led to increased cord-cutting in recent years. People have been dumping expensive cable TV plans and shifting toward unbundled packages. To tackle this competitive threat, cable MSO's have recently begun launching their own internet TV services through their internet connection. Even so, their offerings could not match the ease and feasibility of the OTT service. This spurred smaller cable operators to partner with video streaming providers for offering the latter's service through a regular set top box. Going forward, we expect to see more of such partnerships between cable TV operators and OTT service providers. Note that Netflix has recently signed another collaborated with cable giant Liberty Global plc  to offer its content on Liberty Global's network.Combining Netflix's attractive content portfolio with its own cable TV system will help Comcast expand its subscriber base. Meanwhile, the partnership will prove equally beneficial for Netflix. The OTT market is on the way to becoming an intensely competitive space given the increasing number of telecom operators rolling out video streaming services. One instance of this is Verizon Communication Inc.'s  launch of 'Go90'. Thus, we believe that the latest partnership is a win-win for both Comcast and Netflix. | Comcast currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@VXF, LBTYA, ALV, LIVN: Large Outflows Detected at ETF@2016-09-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vxf-lbtya-alv-livn-large-outflows-detected-etf-2016-09-12

s per a recent report by Bloomberg, Spanish telecom giant Telefonica SA  is said to have got its act together to sketch out an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of its infrastructure division, Telxius, by September this year. It was since May 2016 that Telefonica was in talks with several banks to conduct an IPO of Telxius. Notably, in June, Telefonica reportedly postponed its planned Telxius IPO and the possible IPO of its U.K. wireless unit O2 because of Brexit.To recall, Telxius was formed in Feb 2016 after a spin-off from Telefonica as a infrastructure division and vested the task of managing the company's infrastructure assets. The spin-off of an infrastructure unit is not new in the global telecom space. Before this, America Movil SAB  had spun off its Telesite infrastructure division; and then, Telecom Italia SpA  had also opted for the same.At present, Telxius manages about 15,000 wireless towers and an international submarine-cable network covering 31,000 kilometers (19,000 miles). More assets are likely to be assigned to Telxius over time.The IPO is aimed at raising funds to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion ($1.66 Billion) to cut the high debt level of Telefonica. Telefonica exited the second quarter of 2016 with total debt of about €63,712 million (about $70,720 million), up from €49,921 million ($55,412 million) recorded at the end of 2015. Telefonica ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of €2884 million (around $3,200 million) compared with €5,570 million (around $6,182 million) at 2015-end. This accumulating debt and decreasing cash flows may pose problems for its credit ratings going ahead. The company was planning to reduce its debt burden after divesting its O2 division. However, the plan fell through as the transaction failed to materialize. Recently, Liberty Global Plc.  has shown interest in acquiring O2 but nothing concrete has emerged as of now.Telefonica currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) | Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Inflow Detected - VXF, LBTYA, ALV, LIVN@2016-09-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-inflow-detected-vxf-lbtya-alv-livn-2016-09-02

Moreover, the company's earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 708.89%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Liberty Global has been underperforming for quite some time now, with both the share price and earnings estimates on a downtrend. Moreover, the company's operations in Europe, which has been subjected to considerable volatility post Brexit, are a major concern. The ongoing debt-crisis and low per-capita income may impede customer spending on pricey high-speed communication services. This may dent the top line and EBDITA margins for Liberty Global.Liberty Global's video, broadband, fixed-line telephony and mobile services are also facing intense competition as the market for such businesses is rapidly evolving, increasing the number of alternate providers available to customers. Costs associated with change in programming rates, inclusive of retransmission and copyright fees charged by broadcasters, may further hurt margins. Recently, Liberty Global and Vodafone Group Plc.  jointly offered concessions through the divestment of infrastructure assets to rivals to ensure regulatory clearance for their proposed joint venture (JV) in the Netherlands.Nevertheless, Liberty Global is expected to benefit from its widespread adoption of broadband and data services in the form of its new launch of DOCSIS 3.1 network services, acquisition of UTV Ireland TV stations from ITV and takeover of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc. However, Liberty Global's interest in acquiring Telefonica SA's  O2 is contingent on the collapse of O2's merger deal with U.K. wireless giant Hutchison Whampoa.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.

" , a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe and Latin America has entered into an agreement with ITV plc. to acquire UTV Ireland TV stations from the latter through its subsidiary Virgin Media. The deal is valued at €10 million and is subject to regulatory approval from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as well as a separate media plurality test by the Irish Government.UTV Ireland is a free-to-air entertainment channel currently available on Virgin Media, eir Vision, Vodafone Group Plc.  , Sky and Saorview networks. Per the deal, Virgin Media will assume the existing 10-year program supply agreement between UTV Ireland and ITV Global Entertainment.In Jun 2013, Liberty Global had acquired a 100% stake in the British cable MSO, Virgin Media. In the U.K., the merged entity poses serious competitive threat to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc, which is partially controlled by News Corp.  . In recent years, Liberty Global has been extensively investing in the Irish market. Last year, UPC Ireland, a subsidiary of Liberty Global, acquired free-to-air Irish TV broadcaster TV3 from a private equity firm Doughty Hanson. It also purchased the Irish Wi-Fi provider Bitbuzz.Notably, in Jul 2014, Liberty Global acquired a 6.4% stake in ITV plc. from British Sky Broadcasting Group plc.

"mage source: Getty Images. Shares of  (NASDAQ: LBTYA) fell 22.2% in June 2016,  . Share prices started sliding at a modest pace in the second week of the month, due to rumors of a messy acquisition about to happen in Poland. Moreover, a pending merger of Liberty Global's Dutch operations with the cable assets of telecom titan  (NASDAQ: VOD) was labeled ""an act of desperation"" as Vodafone was downgraded.But all of that was just noise on the line by the end of the month. The vote to separate Britain from the European Union slammed Liberty Global shares like a runaway freight train. About three-quarters of June's massive plunge fell under the Brexit banner. The international cable arm of American billionaire John Malone's media empire collects 36% of its annual revenue in the U.K., which also holds the company's headquarters. Hence, British affairs are very relevant to Liberty Global's bottom line.The Brexit vote threatens to undermine the British economy in the long run, with unpredictable effects on local consumer markets. The British Pound immediately fell 12% against the U.S. dollar, and you'll see the very direct effects of that change in Liberty Global's next earnings report. Liberty Global's management is keeping a stiff upper lip, of course. The Vodafone deal, for example, will happen anyway.""The deal with Vodafone is already agreed,"" said Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries in a  shortly after the British vote. ""It is being reviewed by EU regulators and their review should not be impacted by Brexit.""Indeed, Fries doesn't seem worried about the political headwinds at all.""It has no immediate impact on our business and it has not reduced our appetite or interest in Europe,"" Fries continued. ""The U.K. is a relatively large part of our business and in the end, British consumers will still want the same products and services.""Fair enough, I suppose. The political climate change is unlikely to transform British culture and consumer habits overnight. The company must still overcome the currency valuation cliff, since Liberty Global reports its results in U.S. dollars, but the underlying business is not going away.Expect more volatility from this stock as the Brexit shock waves continue to settle.

ccording to a recent report by  , Dutch market regulator, Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) has approached the European Union (EU) Commission for permission to evaluate the merger between Liberty Global Plc  's  Dutch cable company Ziggo and Vodafone Group Plc  's  Dutch operations.In Feb 2016, British telecom giant Vodafone and the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe,Liberty Global decided to merge their Dutch operations to form a 50-50 joint venture (JV). As per the agreement, Vodafone will pay €1 billion (approximately $1.12 billion) in cash to Liberty Global to bring the valuation of each of their local units on par. The companies are expecting to achieve cost and revenue synergies of €3.5 billion (around $3.9 billion) after factoring in integration costs. The deal is expected to close by end-2016, subject to regulatory approval.Notably, last year, the companies had been negotiating over a series of transactions including global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations were abandoned after the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations. At the moment, Vodafone and Liberty Global are combining their Dutch businesses. However, the companies have refused to comment on the possibility of the deal being extended to other markets in the future.The European Union Competition Commission (EC) is expected to announce its decision on the proposed JV between Vodafone and Liberty Globalin the Netherlands on July 19, 2016. However, this deadline is provisional and can be extended if the regulatory authority wants to extensively investigate the potential impact of the venture on the competitiveness in the market. In the event of the deal materializing, the combined Vodafone-Liberty Global entity will pose formidable challenge to key players like Royal KPN NV and T-Mobile Netherlands of Deutsch Telekom in the country.In 2015, U.K.'s market regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) made a similar request related to the proposed merger of  SA's O2  and 3UK but was denied permission. The reason behind the refusal was EU's stance that it is better placed to ensure the consistent application of merger control rules. Thus, the question that looms large is whether EU will make the same decision for Vodafone and Ziggo.Notably, the EU commission expects ACM to announce its decision by early August.Currently Vodafone carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Liberty Global carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Investors interested in the same sector can consider better-ranked stock such as NTT DoCoMo Inc.  with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

he European Union Competition Commission (EC) recently confirmed that  and  have jointly offered some concessions to ensure regulatory clearance for their proposed joint venture (JV) in the Netherlands. Although the type of concessions offered is yet to be disclosed, the telecom operators generally divest infrastructure assets to their competitors to win regulatory approval. The EC is scheduled to take a decision on the deal by Aug. 3, subject to feedback from competitors and other interested parties.In Feb 2016, British telecom giant Vodafone and Liberty Global -- the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe - decided to merge their Dutch operations to form a 50-50 JV.

Liberty Global, through its Ziggo subsidiary, serves approximately 4.1 million pay-TV subscribers in the country. Of the total, nearly 3.1 million customers also use Ziggo's broadband service while 2.5 million customers use its voice service.It is worth mentioning here that Ziggo already has an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Vodafone Netherlands. At present, Ziggo serves around 181,000 mobile customers in the country using Vodafone's wireless network. In the event of the deal materializing, the combined Vodafone-Liberty Global entity will pose a formidable challenge to key players like Royal KPN NV and T-Mobile Netherlands of Deutsch Telekom in the country.Last week, Reuters reported that the Dutch market regulator, Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) had approached the EC for permission to evaluate the Liberty Global - Vodafone JV.

imilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in LBTYA.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 2 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of 7 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 23 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Liberty Global has seen 1 downward estimate revision versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 5 cents a share from 6 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 27.7% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Cable TV industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Cable ONE, Inc.  . The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and may be better selection at this time.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hen saving for retirement or looking for solid long-term investment options, many Americans turn to mutual funds to maximize the return on their savings, as well as to put their capital in the hands of professional money managers. Using the  , we have picked out the 3 top performing mutual funds from the last 3 years based on total return percentage:With a total 3 year return of 25.76%, the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund has been the best performing mutual fund in the last 3 years. Managed by the T. Rowe Price family and manager Joshua Spencer, the fund seeks long-term capital growth through investing at least 80% of its net assets throughout the world in the common stocks of companies that generate a majority of their revenues from the development, advancement, and use of technology. The company holdings range from small companies to blue chip firms with established records.PRGTX has been extremely successful over the last 3 years by allocating its assets mostly in large growth companies (47.12%), small growth companies (12.07%), and high yield bonds (24.22%). Its 3 largest holdings are Alphabet Inc.  with 7.69% of assets, or $208.98 million, Liberty Global PLC  with 7.13% of assets, or $193.78 million, and Tesla Motors Inc.  with 6.30% of assets, or $171.25 million. The total net assets for the fund are just over $2.7 billion.PRGTX is actually currently a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #2 (Buy), and is positioned to continue to be one of the more profitable funds around. With a minimum investment of $2,500 and an expense ratio of .91, this historically high-return-producing fund should be on all long-term investors' minds.Coming in as the second best performing mutual fund over the past 3 years is the Profunds Internet UltraSector Fund. This fund's goal is long-term capital appreciation by seeking daily investment results that correspond to 150% of the performance of the Dow Jones Composite Internet Index. INPIX primarily invests in internet companies or in instruments that provide exposure to these companies.The fund's biggest weightings are in the tech industry at 39.65%, other industries with 29.26%, and the finance industry at 12.39%. Its three largest holdings are Facebook  at 9.28% of assets, Alphabet Inc.  at 8.55%, and Amazon.com Inc.  at 7.67%. The fund's biggest allocations are for large growth companies at 70.30% of assets, and small growth companies with 12.96%.INPIX's total return over the past 3 years comes in at a solid 23.06%, and under the leadership of the Pro Funds family and manager Michael Neches it will continue to push for high returns for its investors. Though currently a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #3 (Hold), this fund has the potential to continue to be one of the top performers for years to come, especially as internet-based companies continue to develop.Finally, with a 3-year total return of 21.05%, is the Fidelity Select Medical Equipment and Systems Portfolio. This fund also seeks long-term capital appreciation, but to do so looks to invest in the common stocks of companies principally engaged in the research, development, manufacture, distribution, supply, or sale of medical equipment.Not surprisingly the fund's biggest weighting is in the health sector, with a weight of 75.05%. In regards to allocation, large growth, small growth, and foreign stock garner most of the fund's assets. FSMEX's 3 biggest holdings are Medtronic PLC  with 24.8% of assets, Boston Scientific Corp.  with 10.99%, and Intuitive Surgical Inc.  at 6.35%.The FSMEX fund has great deal of potential to continue to its streak of success over the past three years, especially as the healthcare sector continues to grow and evolve. FSMEX is also currently a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy), placing it near the top of all mutual funds ranked by Zacks.One should note that these top-performing funds involve themselves in the technology and health industries, which have seen large amounts of growth in recent years, and still hold great potential moving forward. Because of this, all three funds can continue to be some of the better performing mutual funds available and long-term investors may want to consider them for investment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

panish telecom behemoth  is facing the brunt of Brexit, Britain's vote to leave the European Union. According to Bloomberg, the company is considering seriously to postpone the planned initial public offering (IPO) of its Telxius infrastructure unit and the possible IPO of its U.K. wireless unit O2.The likelihood of a delay is the result of market volatility apprehended worldwide in the wake of the Brexit referendum. However, Telefonica denied commenting officially on this issue. Consequently, the stock price of Telefonica plummeted nearly 18% in NYSE, on Friday.Since May 2016, Telefonica was in talks with several banks to conduct an IPO of Telxius. Formed in Feb 2016, the division which was assigned the task of managing the company's infrastructure assets. At present, Telxius manages about 15,000 wireless towers and an international submarine-cable network covering 31,000 kilometers (19,000 miles). More assets are likely to be assigned to Telxius over time.Telefonica was aiming to raise around €4 - €5 billion ($4.5 - $5.6 billion) from the Telxius IPO. The spin-off of an infrastructure unit is not new in the global telecom space. Earlier, America Movil SAB  had spun-off its Telesite infrastructure division while Telecom Italia SpA  also opted for the same.The flotation of the Telxius IPO has become important for Telefonica after the European Union telecom regulator blocked the proposed sale of its O2 unit in the U.K. to 3UK of Hutchison Whampoa. The deal size was around $14.9 billion.Telefonica's debt currently stands at approximately €52.2 billion. The company was planning to reduce its debt burden after divesting its O2 division. However, the plan fell through as the transaction failed to materialize. Telefonica was reportedly planning an IPO for its O2 division. Notably, European cable MSO Liberty Global Plc.  had shown interest in acquiring O2 but it now looks to be impossible after the Brexit verdict.According to some industry watchers, Telefonica may now be forced to sell some of its core assets to raise cash and pay-off debt. Otherwise its debt rating may be badly affected. Telefonica currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (Symbol: EUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $48.49 per unit.With EUSA trading at a recent price near $44.20 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.71% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EUSA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), Palo Alto Networks, Inc (Symbol: PANW), and Liberty Interactive Corp (Symbol: QVCA). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $36.57/share, the average analyst target is 46.09% higher at $53.42/share. Similarly, PANW has 41.35% upside from the recent share price of $131.26 if the average analyst target price of $185.54/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting QVCA to reach a target price of $34.62/share, which is 36.43% above the recent price of $25.38. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, PANW, and QVCA:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

ccording to a recent report by Bloomberg, Spanish telecom giant  is in talks with several banks to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) of its infrastructure division Telxius.Citing an unnamed source, Bloomberg reported that Telefonica is negotiating with CaixaBank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase as global coordinators for IPO flotation. Moreover, Mediobanca, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Santander, Citigroup, and UBS will act as joint book runners.In Feb 2016, Telefonica created the Telxius division which was assigned the task of managing the company's infrastructure assets. At present, Telxius manages about 15,000 wireless towers and an international submarine-cable network covering 31,000 kilometers (19,000 miles) of Telefonica. More assets are likely to be assigned to Telxius over time.Telefonica is aiming to raise around €4 - €5 billion ($4.5 - $5.6 billion) from the Telxius IPO. The spin-off of an infrastructure unit is not new in the global telecom space. Earlier America Movil SAB  had spun off its Telesite infrastructure division and Telecom Italia SpA  has also opted for the same.The flotation of the Telxius IPO has become important for Telefonica after the European Union telecom regulator blocked the proposed sale of its O2 unit in the U.K. to 3UK of Hutchison Whampoa. The deal size was around $14.9 billion.Meanwhile, Telefonica's debt currently stands at approximately €50.2 billion. The company was planning to reduce its debt burden after divesting its O2 division. However, the plan fell through as the transaction failed to materialize. Recently, Liberty Global Plc.  has shown interest in acquiring O2 but nothing concrete has emerged as of now.At this juncture, proceeds from the IPO of Telxius can help Telefonica to reduce some of its outstanding debt. Telefonica currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

he proposed merger between Spanish telecom behemoth  -controlled O2 and U.K. wireless giant Hutchison Whampoa, which is currently operating under the 3 UK brand, has been vetoed by the European Union Competition Commission (EC) on anti-competitive grounds.At present, the U.K. wireless market is dominated by four large players, namely, O2, 3 UK, Vodafone Group Plc.  and EE - recently acquired by BT Group Plc  . Meanwhile, if the deal would have been approved, the number of incumbent players would reduce to three.Currently, O2 serves over 22 million customers. Post merger, the combined entity, with a consolidated subscriber base of more than 30 million, would have formed the largest wireless operator in the U.K. The regulators fear that this would have muted innovation and led to higher prices for consumers.Notably, in Mar 2015, Telefonica had decided to divest its O2 brand to 3 UK. The deal - worth GBP 10.25 billion (approximately $15.25 billion) - has been facing opposition since announcement owing to anti-competitive concerns. Thus, the rejection of the Telefonica-Hutchison merger is not much of a surprise.In Feb 2016, the communications regulator in the U.K. -- Ofcom - attempted to influence the EC against the proposed Telefonica-Hutchison deal in the country and warned of its possible consequences.Last September, Hutchison informed the EC about its proposed takeover of O2. Soon after, in October, Ofcom submitted a request with the EC to refer all or part of the deal for assessment to it. In the same month, the EC launched an in-depth investigation into the proposed deal. In Dec 2015, the EC rejected Ofcom's plea to take over the evaluation of the deal despite its claims of having a better understanding of the domestic market.On Apr 11, 2016, U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed concerns over the proposed merger deal and urged the EC to stall it as it would likely raise prices of wireless services in the nation and may also reduce the quality of services. It is to be noted in this regard that the U.K. is set to have a referendum on Jun 23 on whether or not to remain in the European Union.In order to clear the deal, Hutchison had even decided to grant additional concessions to small-sized wireless operators. 3 UK had proposed to allot 20% of its existing network capacity to Sky - which would be a new entrant in the mobile space - and 10% of the combined network's capacity to Virgin Mobile.However, the EC believes that these concessions would not have been able to resolve the issues that might have cropped up following the merger.After the failed deal with 3 UK, Telefonica is presently on the lookout for potential buyers and is also mulling over an initial public offering or strategic shift into fixed line markets.Only recently, U.K. cable TV behemoth Liberty Global plc  hinted at the possibility of a potential acquisition of O2 in order to expand its mobile operations in Europe and boost its subscriber count and efforts to offer quad-play services. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether Liberty Global pursues the O2 takeover.Meanwhile, over the last couple of years, the U.K. telecom sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidations. Introduction of the latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition in this market. In order to attain economies of scale and remain competitive, several telecom companies are looking for merger options in a bid to offer competent quad-play services of wireless, wireline, Internet and video services.However, a trade-off between achieving scale economies and continuation of competitive prices is of utmost importance. EC's decision to block the Telefonica-Hutchison merger deal and its emphasis on maintaining effective competition in the market is likely to discourage similar deals in the future.Telefonica currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@VXF, LBTYA, ALX, PTLA: ETF Outflow Alert@2016-05-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vxf-lbtya-alx-ptla-etf-outflow-alert-2016-05-10

" .  - a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe and Latin America - recently took over a major Caribbean cable operator - Cable & Wireless Communications Plc. The deal was valued at approximately $7.4 billion on an enterprise value basis. Cable & Wireless will be integrated into Liberty Global's Latin American and Caribbean group (the ""LiLAC Group"").The deal was formulated in Nov 2015 and the two companies received their shareholders' approval on Apr 2016. The combined entity will become a formidable player in Latin and Central America as a consumer and business-to-business communications service provider.Currently, Cable & Wireless and LiLAC jointly serve 10,049,200 customers including 1,767,400 video, 2,037,600 broadband, 2,003,200 telephony and 4,241,000 mobile subscribers. The combined entity has a footprint in 20 Latin or Central American markets and is expected to generate over $3.6 billion in revenues per annum with an asset base of $10.211 billion.The acquisition of Cable & Wireless will enable Liberty Global to boost its rapidly growing operations in Latin America and the Caribbean region.

Further, the combined operations will help Liberty Global achieve economies of scale.Moreover, it is estimated to deliver low double-digit rebased operating cash flow (OCF) growth over the medium term. Also, together with significant synergy prospects, the combined operations will open up additional consolidation opportunities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

he European Union Competition Commission (EC) has decided to take a decision on the proposed joint venture (JV) between  and  in the Netherlands on Jul 19, 2016. However, this deadline is provisional and can be extended if the regulatory authority wants to extensively investigate the potential impact of this JV on the competitiveness of the Netherlands market.In Feb 2016, British telecom giant Vodafone and Liberty Global - the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe - decided to merge their Dutch operations to form a 50-50 JV. As per the agreement, Vodafone will pay €1 billion (approximately $1.12 billion) in cash to Liberty Global to bring the valuation of each of their local units on par. The two companies are expecting to achieve cost and revenue synergies of €3.5 billion (around $3.9 billion) after factoring in integration costs. The deal is expected to close by end-2016, subject to regulatory approval.Notably, last year, the two companies had been negotiating on a series of transactions including global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations were abandoned after the two companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations. At the moment, Vodafone and Liberty Global are combining their Dutch businesses. Both the companies have declined to comment whether there is a possibility of the deal being extended to other markets in the future.Vodafone has a nationwide 4G LTE network in the Netherlands serving around 5.13 million mobile and about 73,000 fixed broadband subscribers. Meanwhile, Liberty Global, through its Ziggo subsidiary, serves approximately 4.1 million pay-TV subscribers in the country. Of the total, nearly 3.1 million customers also use Ziggo's broadband service while 2.5 million customers use its voice service.It is worth mentioning here that Ziggo already has an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Vodafone Netherlands. At present, Ziggo serves around 181,000 mobile customers in the country using Vodafone's wireless network. In the event of the deal materializing, the combined Vodafone-Liberty Global entity will pose a formidable challenge to key players like Royal KPN NV and T-Mobile Netherlands of Deutsch Telekom in the country.Liberty Global is a leading cable MSO with presence in 12 European countries. Besides its triple-play (video, voice and fixed line broadband) services, the company now also offers mobile services. Apart from Ziggo in the Netherlands, Liberty Global offers wireless service in the UK post its Virgin Media acquisition. The company received the European Union regulatory nod to take over Belgian wireless operator BASE N.V. from Royal KPN N.V.Vodafone, on the other hand, is a global telecom operator offering wireless and wireline services). The company recently diversified its operations in the cable-TV space after the acquisitions of Kabel Deutschland in Germany and ONO in Spain. Therefore a combination of Vodafone and Liberty Global can offer quad-play wireless, wireline, voice and video services.Currently, Vodafone carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $48.73 per unit.With QQEW trading at a recent price near $42.02 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.97% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), Liberty Interactive Corp (Symbol: QVCA), and Baidu, Inc. (Symbol: BIDU). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $39.02/share, the average analyst target is 37.49% higher at $53.65/share. Similarly, QVCA has 32.52% upside from the recent share price of $25.98 if the average analyst target price of $34.43/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BIDU to reach a target price of $218.33/share, which is 18.67% above the recent price of $183.98.

"nvestors in Liberty Global Plc (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 17th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new June 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of 75 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.25 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.04/share today.Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 71%.

If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $37.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $37.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.02% if the stock gets called away at the June 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $37.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $37.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

s per recent reports, U.K. cable TV behemoth  may consider taking over Spanish telecom behemoth Telefonica SA  -controlled O2. However, this deal is contingent on the collapse of O2's GBP 10.25 billion (roughly $15.25 billion) merger deal with U.K. wireless giant Hutchison Whampoa, which is currently operating under the 3UK brand.At present, the U.K. wireless market is dominated by four large players, namely, O2, 3UK, Vodafone Group Plc.  and BT Group Plc.  and if the deal is passed, it would reduce the number to three. Thus, the proposed merger deal between 3UK and O2 is likely to be vetoed by the European Union Competition Commission (EC) on anti-competitive grounds.Liberty Global has been under pressure to step up its mobile operations in various European markets where rivals are actively promoting quad-play bundled services which include video, landline phone, broadband data (Internet) and wireless offerings.Last year, the company was in talks with U.K. telecom giant Vodafone concerning a series of transactions such as global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations came to an end after the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations.Meanwhile, the potential acquisition of O2 would radically expand Liberty Global's mobile operations in Europe and boost its subscriber count and efforts to offer quad-play services.Though Liberty Global - a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- values the flexibility of being a virtual mobile service provider, the company has been implementing changes in its strategy with the intention to take over mobile operations instead of borrowing network services. This is evident from the company's acquisition of Belgian telecom operator BASE N.V. as well. Thus, it won't come as a surprise if Liberty Global pursues the takeover of O2.Meanwhile, we note that Telefonica is on the lookout for potential buyers and is also mulling over an initial public offering or strategic shift into fixed line markets if the deal to merge with 3UK fails.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Apr 4, we issued an updated research report on the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe -  .The company reported disappointing financial results in the fourth quarter of 2015 wherein both the top and the bottom line compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Nonetheless, we believe that the long-term fundamentals of the company are quite intriguing as the company is gradually establishing a strong foothold in the European cable MSO market.Recently, Liberty Global and British telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc.  decided to merge their Dutch operations in order to form a 50-50 joint venture (JV) in the country. Per the deal, Vodafone will pay €1 billion (roughly $1.12 billion) in cash to Liberty Global to match the valuation of each of their local units. Moreover, the companies are hopeful of achieving cost and revenue synergies worth €3.5 billion (around $3.9 billion) after factoring integration costs. The deal is expected to close by end-2016, subject to customary regulatory approval.Meanwhile, Liberty Global received the final nod from the anti-trust regulatory body, European Union (EU) Competition Commission, for the closure of its planned purchase of Belgian telecom operator BASE N.V. The Telenet brand, operated by Liberty Global, is the fourth major carrier in the Belgian wireless market. The merged entity - Telenet and BASE - will now enjoy a 30% market share.Moreover, Liberty Global announced its wide-scale deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 network for customers in Europe, with intentions to expand the service in the U.S. later. Notably, in broadband, the company continues to leverage from speed advantage and aims to provide gigabyte speed with DOCSIS 3.1. Liberty Global has also equipped itself with ARRIS Touchstone TG2492 Gateway to support its high-speed broadband Internet and streaming services.Further, as of Dec 31, 2015, the company had almost 6.1 million WiFi access points in its European footprint and plans to increase its WiFi access points to over 10.0 million in 2016. Thus, by combining its fixed network with a mobile strategy centered on full MVNOs and Wi-Fi, the company aims to deliver fast, seamless and superior connectivity to customers.However, the markets for video, broadband, fixed-line telephony and mobile services are highly competitive and speedily evolving. Consequently, Liberty Global's businesses are expected to keep facing considerable competition in the countries in which they operate.Moreover, the company's recent acquisitions may certainly give rise to integration risks. Further, foreign exchange rate risks and various regulatory concerns, given the company's operations in various countries outside the U.S., remain potent headwinds.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the sector are Dish Network Corp.  and Shaw Communications, Inc.  . Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Liberty Global Plc (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options become available this week, for the May 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new May 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of 85 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $37.35/share today.Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 71%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.43% return on the cash commitment, or 15.28% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, and highlighting in green where the $35.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 95 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $37.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.64% if the stock gets called away at the May 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (Symbol: VXF) where we have detected an approximate $129.7 million dollar inflow -- that's a 3.6% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 45,193,129 to 46,799,716). Among the largest underlying components of VXF, in trading today Liberty Global plc Class A Ord (Symbol: LBTYA) is down about 1.4%, First Cash Financial Services Inc (Symbol: FCFS) is down about 1.9%, and iRobot Corp (Symbol: IRBT) is lower by about 0.2%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of VXF, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, VXF's low point in its 52 week range is $69.63 per share, with $95.03 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $79.83. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vanguard Extended Market ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2016-03-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vanguard-extended-market-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2016-03-15
"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (Symbol: EUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $47.47 per unit.With EUSA trading at a recent price near $41.16 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.34% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EUSA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Symbol: JAZZ), and Liberty Interactive Corp (Symbol: QVCA). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $35.91/share, the average analyst target is 49.05% higher at $53.52/share. Similarly, JAZZ has 44.27% upside from the recent share price of $126.56 if the average analyst target price of $182.58/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting QVCA to reach a target price of $35.43/share, which is 41.15% above the recent price of $25.10. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, JAZZ, and QVCA:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The Implied Analyst 12-Month Target For EUSA@2016-03-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/implied-analyst-12-month-target-eusa-2016-03-10
"illionaire investor Warren Buffett may not be one of your Facebook friends, but you can still know what stocks he's buying. Big-time investors such as Buffett submit a 13F report to the Securities and Exchange Commission every quarter, highlighting what stocks they're buying and selling. Last quarter, Buffett boosted his exposure to  ,  , and  . Let's take a closer look at why the Oracle of Omaha wants to own more of these companies and if they might be worth owning in your portfolio, too. Wells Fargo has been a big holding for Warren Buffett's  for years, and last quarter, Buffett increased his stake in the nation's biggest mortgage lender by 9.4 million shares.Buffett now owns 479.7 million shares in Wells Fargo, and since he's the bank's biggest shareholder, it's pretty clear that he thinks Wells Fargo has plenty of opportunity ahead of it. The economy continues to grow, albeit tepidly, and with the Federal Reserve shifting to rising interest rates, spreads between borrowing and lending rates should widen, providing profit tailwinds.Last quarter, total average loans grew 7% to $912.3 billion, and net income totaled $5.7 billion. Net income for the full year was $23 billion, in line with 2014, and rising short-term rates could help lift results in 2016. The bank cited higher short-term rates as one reason its net interest income jumped $131 million year over year in Q4.Given that the bank enjoys solid loan demand, it boasts arguably best-in-show financials, and its shares yield about 3%, investors might want to join Warren Buffett by making Wells Fargo a core holding in their portfolios, too.SOURCE: DEERE & CO. Buffett also bought more shares in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Company.Berkshire Hathaway added 5.8 million shares of Deere & Co., and it now owns 22.9 million shares in the company overall.The 34% increase in Buffett's stake suggests confidence that worry over global economic growth in Asia and Europe will ease and that rebounding crude  will correlate to a bounce back in grain prices that could support equipment demand.Last quarter, Deere & Co.'s management reported that fiscal first-quarter sales fell 13% year over year, and that it forecast an additional 10% drop in 2016.That's not very bullish, but it appears that Buffett is willing to play the long game and assume that this is about the worst it will get for Deere & Co. If so, it might not be a bad bet. Even with all the headwinds, Deere & Co.'s C-suite still thinks it will deliver earnings of $1.3 billion this year.Following the purchase of 587,011 shares last quarter, Berkshire Hathaway's 12.5 million-share position makes it Liberty Global's third biggest shareholder.Buffett has always been a fan of great management teams, and there may be no better media CEO than Liberty Global's John Malone. Malone has been busy transforming Liberty Global into the European leader in media services, and recent deals that expand it into mobile position it nicely to pitch quad-play (television, telephone, Internet, and mobile) services to subscribers.Earlier this month, Liberty Global reported that it's partnering with  to create a joint venture in the Netherlands to offer quad-play services, and last year, Malone spent $1.3 billion acquiring Belgian mobile operator Base.Because Liberty Global's subscribers provide it with mountainous free cash flow that's growing thanks to new services, Buffett may keep this position for the long haul and if so, then Liberty Global shares may be worth owning.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year! Once you learn how to take advantage of all these loopholes, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

"arren Buffett's uber long-term approach to investing is legendary, and because Buffett remains one of the globe's wealthiest people, investors might want to follow in his footsteps -- especially, given market volatility lately. With that in mind, let's learn more about Buffett's big buys last quarter.It wasn't all that long ago that Buffett dodged a big drop in energy stocks by paring back his exposure to them; but with energy stocks collapsing, and bargains in the discount bin, Buffett is back to buying. Last quarter, the Oracle of Omaha stepped up and acquired 26,533,525 shares of Kinder Morgan, a big enough stake to make it worth $466 million of his  $123 billion portfolio.It appears Buffett's timing was spot on. Shares in Kinder Morgan fell 63%, to $14.79 in 2015, and they've already rallied 16% since the start of the year. That's pretty darn good.Buffett's decision to buy Kinder Morgan could have been made because he felt energy stocks fell too far too fast, and because he believed that production cuts would shore up per-barrel  . The number of active rigs drilling for oil in North America dropped 56% in the past year, and major oil producing countries, including Saudi Arabia, recently announced plans to freeze oil production at January's level, further supporting  .The macro environment, however, may only be one reason why Buffett warmed up to Kinder Morgan. Traditionally, Buffett prefers that corporations spend cash on their businesses, rather than dividends, and that mantra dovetails nicely with Kinder Morgan's decision in December to shift money from dividends to debt repayment.Only time will tell if the spike in oil prices, and Buffett's interest in Kinder Morgan, will be long lasting. In the past, Buffett has been willing to trade around in energy stocks; if investors follow Buffett into this one, they might want to watch it closely.Source: Deere & Co.Also intriguing is Buffett's decision to increase his stake in the agricultural equipment maker Deere & Company.Deere & Co sales are tightly tied to global economic growth, and with questions remaining in China and Europe, and rising interest rates creating uncertainty in the U.S., it would seem there's plenty of reason to be cautious -- especially when the company's management recently reported that fiscal first-quarter sales slumped 13% year over year, and that sales will slip by another 10% this year.Yet, rather than taking a wait-and-see approach to the company, Buffett upped his position in Deere & Co to 22.88 million shares last quarter. Buffett's decision suggests he thinks a recovery in oil could coincide with a recovery in grains, like corn and wheat, that have also fallen significantly in the past year. Of course, no one knows if grain prices can hold their recent lows, climb, and fatten farmer wallets again; but if prices do improve, then Buffett's bet on Deere & Co could prove savvy.Berkshire Hathaway's 12.5-million-share position in Liberty Global plc -- up 5% from last quarter -- makes it Liberty Global's third largest shareholder. Because Buffett has steadily increased his ownership in Europe's biggest cable group during the past year, it seems he has plenty of confidence in Liberty Global's billionaire Chairman John Malone, and Malone's strategy to expand the company into mobile services.Recently, Liberty Global announced it's teaming up with  in the Netherlands in a joint-venture that creates a quad-play services powerhouse, and previously, Liberty Global spent $1.3 billion acquiring Belgian mobile operator Base. Both of those moves give Liberty Global plenty of up-selling opportunities to fuel growth.Historically, Buffett has been a big fan of free cash flow and strong management teams. Because Liberty Global's free cash flow is growing, and Malone is arguably the best operator in the industry, there's little reason to think Buffett will sell soon. That could make this stock worth adding to portfolios, too.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually.

ritish telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc.  and Liberty Global Plc.  - the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe - have decided to merge their Dutch operations in order to form a 50-50 joint venture (JV) in the country.As per the agreement, Vodafone will pay €1 billion (approximately $1.12 billion) in cash to Liberty Global to bring the valuation of each of their local units on par. Moreover, the two companies are expecting to achieve cost and revenue synergies of €3.5 billion (around $3.9 billion) after factoring integration costs. The deal is expected to close by end-2016, subject to customary regulatory approval.Notably, last year, the two companies had been negotiating on a series of transactions including global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations were abandoned after the two companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations. At the moment, Vodafone and Liberty Global are combining their businesses only in the Netherlands. Both the companies have declined to comment whether there is a possibility of the deal being extended to other markets in the future.Vodafone has a nationwide 4G LTE network in the Netherlands serving 5.13 million mobile and 73,000 fixed broadband subscribers. Meanwhile, Liberty Global, through its Ziggo subsidiary, serves 4.1 million pay-TV subscribers in the country. Of the total, 3.1 million customers also use Ziggo's broadband service while 2.5 million customers use its voice service.It is worth mentioning in this regard that Ziggo already has an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Vodafone Netherlands. At present, Ziggo serves around 181,000 mobile customers in the country using Vodafone's wireless network. In the event of the deal materializing, the combined Vodafone-Liberty Global entity will pose a formidable challenge to key players like Royal KPN NV and T-Mobile Netherlands of Deutsch Telekom in the Netherlands.Liberty Global is a leading cable MSO with presence in 12 European countries. Besides its triple-play (video, voice and fixed line broadband) services, the company now also offers mobile services. Apart from Ziggo in the Netherlands, Liberty Global offers wireless service in the UK post its acquisition of Virgin Media. The company recently received the European Union regulatory nod to takeover Belgian wireless operator BASE N.V. from Royal KPN N.V.Vodafone, on the other hand, is a global telecom operator offering wireless and wireline services). The company recently diversified its operations in the cable-TV space after the acquisitions of Kabel Deutschland in Germany and ONO in Spain. In such a scenario, a broad-based merger of Vodafone and Liberty Global will create an integrated telecom behemoth offering quad-play wireless, wireline, voice and video services.Currently, both Vodafone and Liberty Global carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"esterday, European cable MSO (multi service operator)  received the final nod from the anti-trust regulatory body, European Union (EU) Competition Commission, to close its planned purchase of Belgian telecom operator BASE N.V. Notably, in Apr 2015, Liberty Global had entered into an agreement to take over BASE from its current owner Royal KPN N.V. for €1.325 billion (roughly $1.48 billion).In Oct 2015, EU launched an in-depth investigation under EU Merger Regulation to assess whether the proposed deal will harm the competitive landscape of the Belgian wireless market. At present, the Belgian wireless market is served by four wireless operators. Apart from BASE, Proximus and Orange  controlled Mobistar are two other major carriers. The Telenet brand, operated by Liberty Global, is the fourth major carrier in the country.Telenet primarily offers cable TV and high-speed broadband services. However, Telenet also acts as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) offering wireless services using Mobistar's network infrastructure. The primary concern of the EU telecom regulatory authorities was that if Telenet and BASE merge, the total number of wireless service providers will come down to three. The merged entity - Telenet and BASE - and Mobistar will enjoy 30% market share each while Proximus will command a major 40% market share.Therefore, the consolidation of wireless carriers will lead to a much diminished choice of operators and higher prices for customers. Additionally, after the merger, BASE may no longer offer its network to be used by other MNVOs.Liberty Global has decided to give up some BASE assets in order to obtain the regulatory approval. This involves selling BASE's JIM Mobile brand and its 50% stake in another mobile brand, Mobile Viking, to Belgian rival and radio station operator Medialaan. The intention is to help Medialaan become a full-fledged MVNO operating on BASE's network and thereby convince the EU regulator that the deal will not hurt competition. According to the EU Competition Commission, these measures taken by Liberty Global adequately address all regulatory concerns.This type of tactics to ensure regulatory approval is not new to Liberty Global. In Nov 2014, the company had acquired full control of Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO in the Netherlands, where Liberty Global had existing operations under the UPC brand. To complete the takeover, the company vended its premium pay-TV channel ""Film1"". In addition, Liberty Global provided an assurance that it will not prevent online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc.  from accessing its web (Internet) network either contractually or technically for eight years.In a separate development, Bloomberg recently reported that British telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc.  is in talks with Liberty Global for a possible merger of their operations in the Netherlands. Notably, last year, the two companies had also been negotiating on a series of transactions including global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations were abandoned after the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is expected to release its fourth-quarter 2015 earnings numbers on Feb 11, 2016.In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a remarkable 200%. However, the company has delivered negative earnings surprises in three of the prior four quarters, with a huge average miss of 623.34%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.In Nov 2015, Liberty Global armed itself with ARRIS Touchstone TG2492 Gateway from ARRIS International plc  to support its high-speed broadband Internet and streaming services. The flagship Touchstone TG2492 wireless gateway is touted to deliver the best-in-class Wi-Fi performance, faster speeds and improved connectivity for an expanding number of consumer devices. With consumers increasingly using streaming services for watching Internet TV through mobile devices, the ARRIS Touchstone gateway should provide Liberty Global a suitable platform to offer more innovative media and IPTV services in the future.Moreover, Liberty Global is rapidly expanding its global presence. The company recently reached an agreement to buy Caribbean cable operator Cable & Wireless Communications plc. We believe that its overseas diversification measures positions Liberty Global well for organic growth, going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Media is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. Liberty Global has an earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 3 cents. Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Nokia Corporation  , with an earnings ESP of +23.08% and a Zacks Rank #3Infinera Corporation  , with an earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #3Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@VXF, LBTYA, ALX, DRII: ETF Outflow Alert@2016-03-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vxf-lbtya-alx-drii-etf-outflow-alert-2016-03-23
s per a recent  report, U.K. cable TV behemoth  is set to receive a go-ahead from the anti-trust regulatory body, European Union (EU) Competition Commission, to close its planned purchase of Belgian telecom operator BASE N.V.According to sources, the approval by EU is likely to come shortly after Liberty Global's assurance to divest some assets to another player in the market in order to uphold competition in the Belgian wireless market.Notably, in Apr 2015, Liberty Global entered into an agreement to take over BASE from its current owner Royal KPN N.V. for €1.33 billion (roughly $1.4 billion).In October last year, EU had launched an in-depth investigation under the EU Merger Regulation to assess whether the proposed acquisition of BASE by Liberty Global will harm the competitive landscape of the Belgian wireless market.At present, the Belgian wireless market is served by four wireless operators. Excluding BASE, Proximus and Orange  controlled Mobistar are two other major carriers. The Telenet brand, operated by Liberty Global, draws up the fourth major carrier in the country.Telenet mainly offers cable TV and high-speed broadband services. However, Telenet also acts as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) offering wireless services using Mobistar's network infrastructure.The primary concern of the EU telecom regulatory authorities has been that if Telenet and BASE merge, the total number of wireless service providers will come down to three. The merged entity - Telenet and BASE - and Mobistar will hold 30% of the market share each while Proximus will command a major 40% market share.Therefore, the consolidation of wireless carriers will lead to a much diminished choice of operators and higher prices for the customers. Additionally, after the merger, BASE may no longer offer its network to be used by other MNVOs.Liberty Global has decided to give up some BASE assets in order to obtain the regulatory approval. This involves selling BASE's JIM Mobile brand and its 50% stake in another mobile brand, Mobile Viking, to Belgian rival and radio station operator Medialaan.The intention is to help Medialaan become a full fledged MVNO operating on BASE's network and thereby convince EU that the deal will not hurt competition.Liberty Global as been under pressure to step up its mobile operations in various European markets where rivals are profoundly promoting quad-play bundled services which include video, landline phone, broadband data (Internet) and wireless offerings.Last year, the company was in talks with U.K. telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc  concerning a series of transactions such as global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations came to an end after both the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations.Meanwhile, on principle, the EU Competition Commission has been taking a tough stand on any merger proposal especially if the deal has the potential to reduce the competitive power of that given market.However, it might make an exception this time by approving the impending merger ahead of the Mar 17 official deadline. This should certainly usher in good news for Liberty Global and boost the company's competitive position against rivals.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the sector is Time Warner Cable Inc.  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ccording to a recent report by Bloomberg, British telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc  is in talks with Liberty Global Plc  - the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe, for a possible merger of their operations in the Netherlands. Notably, last year, the two companies had also been negotiating on a series of transactions including global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations were abandoned after the two companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations.Vodafone has a nationwide 4G LTE network in the Netherlands serving 5.13 million mobile and 73,000 fixed broadband subscribers. In the first half of fiscal 2015, the company generated approximately $1 billion of revenues in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Liberty Global, through its Ziggo subsidiary, serves 4.1 million pay-TV subscribers in Netherlands. Of the total, 3.1 million customers also use Ziggo's broadband service while 2.5 million customers use its voice service. Ziggo accounts for around $2.8 billion annualized revenues of Liberty Global.It is worth mentioning in this regard that Ziggo already has an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Vodafone Netherlands. At present, Ziggo serves around 181,000 mobile customers in the country using Vodafone's wireless network.

"he telecom industry experienced a good run last week as most of the key stocks traded in the green. On the earnings front, Verizon Communications Inc.  reported strong financial numbers in the fourth quarter of 2015. Both the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the reported quarter, the company added a significant 1.519 million postpaid wireless customers. In addition, Verizon confirmed that it is considering the sale of its data center portfolio, either fully or partially.In contrast, AT&T Inc.  reported weak financial results wherein both the top and the bottom lines lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AT&T's weaker-than-expected earnings were primarily attributable to a disappointing postpaid wireless subscriber addition of 526,000, down a significant 38.4% year over year. Moreover, T-Mobile US Inc.  is constantly mounting pressure on AT&T with respect to wireless spectrum procurement. Recently, the company asked the FCC to reject the purchase of low-band spectrum by AT&T from East Kentucky Network through a secondary market transaction.Meanwhile, U.S. national telecom carrier Sprint Corp.  and largest Canadian telecom operator Rogers Communications Inc.  reported mixed financial numbers. While Sprint reported a narrower-than-expected loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, its revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the reported quarter, Sprint gained 501,000 postpaid wireless subscribers. In addition, Boost Mobile, the prepaid mobile division of the company, recently launched improved unlimited calling plans and other attractive offers.Rogers Communications declared mixed financial results in fourth-quarter 2015, wherein the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top-line surpassed the same. In the reported quarter, the company added a net of 31,000 postpaid wireless subscribers. Management has decided to cut 200 jobs in its Media segment.Apart from earnings releases, the telecom sector witnessed several significant developments last week. Leading U.S. cable MSO (multi-service operator) Comcast Corp.  stated its plans to woo business customers with WiFi Pro - its latest Wi-Fi solution. The solution comprises cloud-based controls, marketing tools and added innovative capabilities to bring fast Wi-Fi speeds over expanded range to small and medium-sized businesses as well as branch locations of large enterprises.Leading satellite TV provider DISH Network Corp.  and broadband lobby group Stop Mega Cable Coalition were found vehemently opposing the pending merger of Charter Communications, Inc.  with Time Warner Cable Inc.  , citing high concentration in the cable-TV industry.As per a recent Reuters report, Europe-based cable MSO Liberty Global plc  is set to receive a go-ahead from the anti-trust regulatory body, European Union (EU) Competition Commission, to close its planned purchase of Belgian telecom operator BASE N.V. Notably, in Apr 2015, Liberty Global had entered into an agreement to take over BASE from its current owner Royal KPN N.V. for €1.33 billion (roughly $1.4 billion).Read the last  .1.

s per a recent  report, Spanish telecom behemoth Telefonica, S.A.  is interested in purchasing AT&T, Inc.'s  Latin American pay-TV assets. According to sources, the assets are valued at roughly $10 billion.Notably, in Jul 2015, AT&T scaled up to the highest position in the U.S. pay-TV market with the acquisition of DIRECTV and its Latin American properties. The Latin American business comprised satellite and cable TV services in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and various other countries.Notably, Telefonica has been making efforts to modify and restructure its asset mix in order to ease its debt burden. In March last year, the company announced its decision to divest its U.K. wireless operations, which run under the O2 brand, to Hutchison Whampoa for GBP 10.25 billion (roughly $15.25 billion). Moreover, recent  reports suggest that Telefonica is looking to divest its network infrastructure assets in Spain.Though it has a strong presence in the Latin American wireless market, the company is still lagging behind AT&T and America Movil S.A.B. de C.V.'s  Claro in terms of its pay-TV offerings. Thus, Telefonica clearly aims to solidify its control over the Latin American pay-TV market with the takeover of AT&T's assets.Meanwhile, the  report quoted an unconfirmed source that suggested that U.K. cable TV behemoth Liberty Global plc.  may vie for AT&T's Latin American assets. Thus, with more parties showing interest in AT&T's assets in particular countries, the company may reportedly opt to sell its possessions in the region via multiple sale processes.Notably, AT&T leads the market and presently has over 19 million pay-TV customers in Latin America, which includes Mexico and Caribbean. However, depreciating currencies in Brazil and other Latin American countries have dealt a heavy blow to the company's profits.Moreover, AT&T intends to make use of DIRECTV's pay-TV assets only in the U.S. and is thus planning to divest the Latin American pay-TV assets. Notably, the carrier primarily intends to divert its focus to the Latin American telecom market.At an industry conference held in Dec 2015, AT&T's CEO Randall Stephenson had stated the company's intent to vend its Latin American pay-TV assets but hasn't declared anything concrete yet.Thus, after its successful foray into the Mexican telecom industry with the acquisition of Gurpo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico, AT&T now aims to expand its presence in the wireless market of Latin American countries. The proceeds from the sale of its Latin American pay-TV assets should therefore aid AT&T's expansion endeavors.Both AT&T and Telefonica presently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

merican cable behemoth  commenced the trial of its Gigabit broadband connection though DOCSIS 3.1 network in Philadelphia. Comcast will continue to test the same through 2017 and set a target to launch the service commercially by the end of the year.In November this year, Liberty Global plc  had announced its wide-scale deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 network for its customers in Europe, with an eye on expansion of the service in the U.S. at a later date.DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable multi service operators (MSOs) to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was specifically designed as the cable TV industry's answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators. The currently available DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest Internet speeds available in the market.However, the DOCSIS 3.1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3.0. While DOCSIS 3.0 theoretically supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 theoretically offers 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 comes with several operational benefits. Moreover, the technology is backward compatible, allowing the present hybrid fiber-coaxial cable lines to allow the stated Internet speeds by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem. This backward compatibility is the major advantage of this specification, which allows cable MSOs like Comcast to serve high-speed Gigabit broadband to its customers, without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs. This helps in increasing margins.As the pay-TV business continues to shrink due to increased cord cutting, the cable MSOs are increasingly shifting their focus to broadband Internet. High-speed, stable broadband improves customer retention and increases revenues from business enterprise services. Comcast's Xfinity broadband, being number one in the U.S in terms of speed, is certainly a benchmark exhibiting these characteristics. It is therefore, a no-brainer that Comcast's DOCSIS 3.1 rollout will fuel future growth. However, the company is poised to face challenges from its peers like CenturyLink Inc.; Google Fiber service from Alphabet Inc.  as well as telecom operators like Verizon Communications Inc.  who have begun trial of 5G network.Comcast currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" data by  . Shares of  fell 12.9% in November,  . There was nothing smooth about this plunge, with plenty of significant news pulling the stock in every direction. At first, November was looking good for Lionsgate investors. Despite missing Wall Street's estimates in a disappointing second-quarter report, shares rose the next day because media mogul John Malone was buying a 7% stake in the company. Through his cable and content operators  and  , Malone grabbed 10 million Lionsgate shares.Then, the company announced a $200 million investment in reality show producer Pilgrim Studios, good for a 50% stake in that company. At the same time, a large bank launched a secondary offering of Lionsgate shares, adding 3.4 million stubs to the free float but contributing nothing to Lionsgate's coffers. This move was part and parcel of John Malone's investment, helping Discovery and Liberty Global secure enough shares at the desired price.Lionsgate investors didn't expect this 2% dilution, nor did they appreciate it. Share prices plunged 7% the next day and 14% by the end of that week. At this point, it's hard to tell whether John Malone's intense interest is good or bad for Lionsgate and its investors. The media maven sent three new representatives into Lionsgate's boardroom as part of his big investment. I say ""new"" because Malone himself grabbed a seat in Lionsgate's boardroom back in February.Nobody knows exactly what Malone is planning to do with Lionsgate, but he currently controls four of the company's 14 board positions. This gives him a real say in where the company goes next. Just a few more slots, and he'd be able to do a quiet takeover that doesn't quite qualify as ""hostile.""Katniss might have a new boss soon. For now, Lionsgate investors seem more nervous than excited about that idea.Cable is dying. And there are three stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models. And when cable falters, you don't want to miss out on these three companies that are positioned to benefit.  for their names.

he European Union Competition Commission (EC), the antitrust regulatory body of the European Union (EU) has rejected the UK competition authority's plea to take over the evaluation of the Telefonica-Hutchison merger deal in the country, despite its claim of understanding the domestic market better.Notably, in Mar 2015, Spanish telecom behemoth  had decided to divest its U.K. wireless operations, which run under the O2 brand, to Hutchison Whampoa, currently operating under the 3 UK brand in the nation. In Sep 2015, Hutchison Whampoa informed the EC regarding its proposed takeover of O2.In Oct 2015, the UK competition authority submitted a request asking the EC to refer all or part of the deal for assessment to it. In the meantime, on Oct 30, the EC opened an in-depth investigation into the proposed merger deal. The regulator has time until Apr 18, 2016 to take a final decision.The total consideration of the merger is GBP 10.25 billion (approximately $15.25 billion). Per the deal, Hutchison will initially pay a total of GBP 9.25 billion (approximately $13.75 billion) with an additional deferred payment of GBP 1 billion (about $1.5 billion). The deal is expected to be completed by Jun 2016, subject to customary regulatory approval. At present, O2 serves over 22 million customers. Post-merger, the combined entity, with a consolidated subscriber base of more than 30 million, will form the largest wireless operator in the U.K.Telefonica has been seeking suitable options for divesting its UK operations for quite some time now. Meanwhile, UK telecom giant BT Group has been planning to re-enter the wireless segment and was eyeing incumbents like O2 and EE as possible takeover targets. Finally, in Dec 2014, BT Group settled for EE, which is jointly controlled by Orange  and Deutsche Telekom AG.Over the last couple of years, the UK telecom sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidation. Introduction of latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition in this market. In order to attain economies of scale to remain competitive, several telecom companies are looking for merger options in a bid to offer quad-play services of wireless, wireline, Internet and video services.The wireless and fixed broadband markets in the UK witnessed a series of consolidations. Vodafone Group Plc.  acquired the fixed-broadband businesses of Cable and Wireless Communications Plc. Moreover, cable MSO (multi service operators) Liberty Global Plc.  took over Virgin Media. Liberty Global has also decided to acquire the Caribbean cable TV operations of Cable and Wireless Communications.Telefonica currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he last week was a favorable one for the telecom industry as most of the key stocks exhibited positive momentum despite the lack of much consequential developments. Among the events that caught the eye was T-Mobile US Inc.'s  introduction of a free-of-cost video streaming service on mobile devices. The 'Binge On' service, as touted by the company, will provide access to 24 streaming servicesto all Simple Choice customers on qualifying plans, at no additional cost.Meanwhile, U.K. cable MSO (multi service operator) Liberty Global plc  has reached an agreement to buy Caribbean cable operator Cable & Wireless Communications plc for approximately $8 billion, including debt. Notably, subject to necessary conditions and approvals, Liberty Global expects the deal to close in the second quarter of 2016.Back at home, Verizon Communications Inc.  recently received a temporary go-ahead from the FCC for the rollout of its Wi-Fi Calling feature. In addition, regional wireline operator Frontier Communications Corp.  announced its 'Price for Life' plan which ensures no further escalation in price for the services provided to its business customers. The plan, which starts from $59.99 per month, is specifically targeted toward customers in the Small and Medium Businesses segment and is available for a limited period.A recent report by Leichtman Research Group revealed that the third quarter of 2015 has turned out to be a mixed one for the U.S. pay-TV industry with sector participants having managed to consolidate their position despite stiff competition from online video streaming service providers. Although the industry continues to witness significant video subscriber losses, the rate of customer churn has narrowed considerably, translating into the best third-quarter performance since 2006 for the top nine cable MSOs in the space.In a separate report, Leichtman Research Group concluded that the cable MSOs in the U.S. have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (Internet) market. At present, cable MSOs commanded nearly 54.3 million subscribers (60.7%) while the remaining 35.2 million customers (39.3%) were serviced by telecom operators.This apart, Mexican telecom regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) recently announced that it will use the combinatorial clock auction (CCA) format for its upcoming AWS spectrum auction scheduled to start in Jan. 2016. The IFT has stated that the application of the CCA format will enable it to divide the frequencies into various slots so that participants can bid for different packages of spectrums as per their needs.Read the last  .1. In a bid to lure customers away from rivals, T-Mobile US has been offering free video streaming and music streaming services on mobile devices. Moreover, as part of various initiatives to boost its mobile features, the company got rid of service contracts and has allowed users to roll over unused data into their next billing cycle.Meanwhile, T-Mobile has made a massive update to its Simple Choice plan by doubling the amount of data available to its Simple Choice customers at all price points, and slashing the price of additional data purchase.

Also, Liberty Global aims to gain from Cable & Wireless' extensive network of undersea cables in the region, which should let Liberty Global benefit from the rapid increase in broadband data consumption. Further, the combined operations will help Liberty Global achieve economies of scale. (Read More:  .)3. The Mexican government has decided to auction 80 MHz of wireless spectrum across various Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) bands. Of the total spectrums to be sold, 30 MHz will be for AWS-1 bands (1710-1725 MHz/2110-2125 MHz) while the remaining 50 MHz will be for AWS-3 bands (1755-1780 MHz/2155-2180 MHz). Notably, AWS spectrums are highly coveted for the deployment of 4G LTE networks. In 2014, the government of Mexico had introduced reforms within its telecommunications sector that led to intensifying competition. (Read More:  .)4. According to a recent report by Leichtman Research, the top 13 pay-TV operators in the U.S. (which control around 95% of the overall market) lost over 190,000 net video subscribers in the third quarter of 2015 compared with a net loss of over 155,000 subscribers in the prior-year quarter. However, the top nine cable MSOs lost about 145,000 subscribers in the reported quarter against a loss of 440,000 subscribers in the year-ago quarter and a massive loss of 600,000 subscribers in the previous quarter. (Read More:  .)5. According to data compiled by Leichtman Research, in the third quarter, 10 major U.S. cable TV operators added a net of 787,629 high-speed Internet subscribers while 7 major telecom operators lost 143,338 net subscribers resulting in a total net subscriber addition of 644,291 for the broadband industry. Through the first nine months of 2015, the cable TV operators have gained around 2.3 million subscribers in contrast to a loss of about 130,000 subscribers on the part of the telecom operators.

Over the last five trading sessions, the share price movement of most major telecom stocks was in the green. DISH Network Corp.  and America Movil SAB  gained 3.07% each during this period. On the other hand, over the last six months, the price performance of key telecom stocks has been predominantly negative  Sprint Corp.  , America Movil and China Mobile Ltd.  depreciated a substantial 17.05%, 15.84% and 10.43% respectively, over the same time frame.We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can likely affect the industry in the coming week. However, certain housing data and the second estimate of the U.S. GDP is set to be released in the coming week which we believe will be closely monitored by investors for a peek into the current U.S. macroeconomic picture.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

n Nov 23, 2015, we issued an updated research report on U.K. cable TV behemoth  .The company reported mixed financial results in the third quarter of 2015, wherein the bottom line steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the top line missed the same.We believe that the long-term fundamentals of the company are quite intriguing as it is gradually establishing a strong foothold in the European cable MSO market.Recently, Liberty Global equipped itself with ARRIS Touchstone TG2492 Gateway to support its high-speed broadband internet and streaming services. The device was jointly developed by Liberty Global, ARRIS Group Inc.  and Compal Electronics of Taiwan. The gateway is expected to provide Liberty Global a platform to offer more innovative media and IPTV services.Moreover, Liberty Global has reached an agreement to buy Caribbean cable operator - Cable & Wireless Communications Plc. - for approximately $8 billion, including debt. Notably, subject to necessary conditions and approvals, Liberty Global expects the deal to close in the second quarter of 2016. We believe the acquisition of Cable & Wireless will allow Liberty Global to offer the much desired quad-play bundled services, thereby broadening its presence in the Caribbean and Latin American region.In Jul 2015, UPC Ireland, a subsidiary of Liberty Global decided to pay €80 million for the acquisition of free-to-air Irish TV broadcaster TV3 from private equity firm Doughty Hanson. Notably, in recent years, Liberty Global has been extensively investing in the Irish market. We believe that the TV3 acquisition will further help the company put a check on subscriber churn in Ireland.Liberty Global has been aggressively rolling out Wi-Fi across its entire footprint. Presently, the company has 6 million Wi-Fi spots across 9 of its European markets, and expects to have about 10 million by early next year. Thus, by combining its fixed network with a mobile strategy centered on full MVNOs and Wi-Fi, the company aims to deliver fast, seamless, and superior connectivity to its customers.However, a failed merger negotiation with Vodafone Group Plc  after both the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations in Sep 2015, is a major setback.Meanwhile, significant foreign exchange rate risks may further result in volatile top-line and EBITDA growth. Moreover, saturated demand in European markets and a highly leveraged balance sheet remain potent headwinds.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the sector is Salem Media Group, Inc.  , with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

.K. cable TV behemoth  has reached an agreement to buy Caribbean cable operator - Cable & Wireless Communications Plc. - for approximately $8 billion, including debt.As per terms of the agreement, Liberty Global will acquire Cable & Wireless for a total equity value of approximately 3.5 billion pounds ($5.3 billion). Liberty Global will pay 78.04 pence per share of Cable & Wireless, which is at a premium of roughly 6% to Cable & Wireless' closing price as of Nov 13, 2015.Further, Cable & Wireless' shareholders would receive a special dividend of 3.00 pence per share, when the transaction closes, taking the total consideration to 81.04 pence a share. Meanwhile, as of Sep 30, 2015, Cable & Wireless had long-term debt of $2.7 billion.Notably, subject to necessary conditions and approvals, Liberty Global expects the deal to close in the second quarter of 2016.Cable & Wireless boasts over six million subscribers and offers quad-play bundled services including video, broadband data (Internet), landline phone and wireless service in the Caribbean, Panama, Monaco and the Seychelles. The company recorded revenues of $1.8 billion in its last fiscal, which ended in March.The acquisition of Cable & Wireless will thus enable Liberty Global to boost its rapidly-growing operations in Latin America and the Caribbean region. Also, Liberty Global aims to gain from Cable & Wireless' extensive network of undersea cables in the region, which should let Liberty Global benefit from the rapid increase in broadband data consumption. Further, the combined operations will help Liberty Global achieve economies of scale.Upon completion, the combined business will serve 10 million video, data, voice and mobile subscribers, with top positions across multiple markets, creating the leading consumer and B2B communications provider in Latin America and the Caribbean.Moreover, the combined business is estimated to deliver low double-digit rebased operating cash flow (OCF) growth over the medium term. Also, together with the significant synergy prospects, the combined operations will build additional consolidation opportunities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.Notably, Liberty Global has been looking to offer quad play bundled services in all the company's territories across Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean for long. In this regard, the company was in talks with U.K. telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc  concerning a series of transactions such as global asset swaps. However, the merger negotiations came to an end after both the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations.We believe the acquisition of Cable & Wireless would thus allow Liberty Global to offer the much desired quad-play bundled services thereby broadening its presence in the Caribbean and Latin American region.Also, the acquisition offers striking organic growth opportunities and the combined business should aid the company in capitalizing on underlying untapped need for broadband, pay TV and mobile products and thereby propel customer take-up.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the sector include Salem Media Group, Inc.  and Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.  .

The Liberty Global Chairman already owned 2.97% of Lions Gate shares outstanding heading into the deal. With his company controlling another 3.4%, he's effectively become a 6% owner of the business. Further accumulation wouldn't be surprising. Lions Gate is a long-term play, so as investors we need to know that Feltheimer and his team are making the kind of bets that can pay off big down the road. The laundry list he gave during the call with analysts sounds impressive enough.""In the quarter, we acquired  based on the best-selling fantasy book series that ranked second only to  . We secured the rights to this coveted multiplatform property because of our emphasis on cross-divisional synergies, enabling us to commit to the simultaneous development of a feature film, television series and video game,"" Feltheimer said.Other plans include adapting the video game franchise  and the board game franchise  . A retelling of the Robin Hood legend is also in the works, as well as a ""multi-picture fantasy epic"" based on Homer's  to be directed by Francis Lawrence of  fame. Of course, there are no sure bets. Fiscal Q2 revenue dropped and losses widened in large part due to poor showings for  and  . Lions Gate plans a $7.2 million writedown related to the latter. Overall, motion picture segment revenue fell 11%. Television production revenue dipped even further, down 20.7% on what the company said was ""timing of episodic deliveries."" Looking ahead, Feltheimer touted a wide array of releases in the second half of the fiscal year. He's right to do so. The list of Lions Gate planned productions includes  , which debuts on Nov. 20 in the U.S., and  , which opens on March 18 of next year. Lions Gate's total backlog of contracted but not yet booked revenue from filmed entertainment came to roughly $1.2 billion at the end of fiscal Q2. In television, Lions Gate is banking on strong returns for upcoming seasons of  and  to boost segment revenue in the second half of the year.In the meantime, investors should keep watch on new deals and unexpected shifts in the pipeline; a sequel to the current run of  movies, for example.

"edia companies seem to be coming under siege in the U.S. as consumers cut the cord and rely more and more on broadband Internet and mobile services. For companies like  , that presents both a threat and an opportunity in its home bases in Europe and Latin America.On Thursday, the company reported third quarter results, and while the revenue growth won't knock your socks off, the company's transition to a new era of media should keep it generating cash flow for many years to come.
  
Source: Company earnings releaseGiven Liberty Global's complex structure, it's important to look at some of the highlights that drove the quarter's numbers.Liberty Global's key European market continues to slowly improve. This won't be a high growth region, but given the entrenched nature of the infrastructure the company offers, it will be a consistent cash generator for years.Surprisingly, Latin America and the Caribbean continue to be strong as well, despite some turbulent economic times. Rebased revenue was up 7%, and operating cash flow grew 10% in the quarter with LiLAC in Chile and Puerto Rico.LiLAC Group is still a small business for Liberty Global, but it's the company's biggest growth opportunity with just 3.5 million subscriptions compared to 53.2 million in Europe. Businesses like mobile are also highly competitive, with a number of regional players in the market, so owning the space may not be as easy as it is in Europe.For the full year, management is expecting mid-single digit growth on a rebased basis for Liberty Global Group and LiLAC Group. The slow growth in Latin America can primarily be explained by a strong dollar, overshadowing subscriber growth. Investors will want to keep an eye on how an unstable economy in the region affects results, however, because macro conditions may play a bigger role than they do in more established economies.In Europe, the strong subscriber additions in broadband should continue with blazing Internet speeds of up to 500 Mbps across Europe. What will be worth watching is the Horizon TV offering, allowing customers to watch TV online. Unlike U.S. offerings, this could replace cable and keep customers in the Liberty Global family. New subscribers of nearly 250,000 shows some solid traction there, and if that continues the future could be bright -- even for the TV side of the business.Cable is dying.

 , a leading cable MSO (multi-service operator) in Europe, is scheduled to release its third-quarter 2015 results on Nov 5, after market close.Last quarter, the company incurred a significant loss. The Zacks Consensus had however estimated earnings, resulting in a mammoth negative surprise of 1,160%. Moreover, the company's bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 662.62%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.The merger negotiations between Liberty Global and Vodafone Group Plc  came to an end recently after both the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations. A merger would certainly have helped Liberty Global achieve economies of scale to remain competitive in certain markets, specifically Western Europe.Meanwhile, stiff competition, high integration risk, mounting programming expenses, foreign exchange rate volatility and saturated demand in European markets are factors that might weigh upon the to-be-reported quarter's performance.However, robust demand for its digital cable-TV services, enhanced broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, rising popularity of Horizon TV services, and continuous expansion of next-generation services are expected to aid Liberty Global's financial performance in the third quarter. Further, we believe that the acquisition of Irish TV broadcaster - TV3 - will help the company to further expand in Ireland and check its declining subscriber count there.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. : Liberty Global's earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at 4 cents. : Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies that you may consider instead as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Townsquare Media, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #2.Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hird-quarter 2015 financial results continued to rule over the telecom sector last week. Several sector participants declared their financial numbers, and the outcome was a mixed bag.Leading Canadian integrated telecom operator BCE Inc.  and small-sized rural telecom operator in the U.S., Windstream Holdings Inc.  reported better-than-expected financial results in the third quarter. Both the companies saw their top and bottom lines outpacing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.On the other hand, U.S. satellite TV giant DISH Network Corp,  , major European cable MSO (multi-service operator) Liberty Global Plc.  and Canadian integrated telecom behemoth TELUS Corp.  posted mixed financial results for the third-quarter 2015. All the three companies surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with respect to earnings but saw disappointment on the revenue front.Outside the U.S., Spanish telecom behemoth Telefonica SA  and its Brazilian subsidiary Telefonica Brasil SA  also reported quarterly results. Telefonica's top and bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Telefonica Brasil fared better, with its bottom line on par with the estimate and revenues exceeding the same.(Read the last  .)1. Windstream's third-quarter 2015 GAAP net loss stood at $7 million or a loss of 8 cents per share compared with net income of $8 million or 8 cents in the year-ago quarter. The company reported adjusted loss per share of 13 cents, considerably narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 41 cents.Pro forma revenues increased 3% year over year to $1,498.6 million in the third quarter, much above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,460 million.

eading cable TV equipment developer  recently introduced two DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems, despite the fact that the next-generation DOCSIS 3.1 standard is yet to be fully certified by the industry consortium - CableLabs.DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs (multi service operator) to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was specifically designed as the cable TV industry's answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators. The currently available DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in terms of the fastest Internet speeds available in the market.The upcoming DOCSIS 3.1 standard is a better formulation of the existing one. While DOCSIS 3.0 theoretically supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 theoretically offers 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 significantly increases network capacity and enhances a cable modem's energy.Arris has introduced two DOCSIS 3.1 modems. The first is Touchstone CM8200, to be used by those cable TV operators who employ Arris' legacy products. The second is SURFboard SB8200, designed for Motorola Surfboard brand users. Notably, in 2013, Arris acquired Motorola Home set-top box business from Alphabet Inc.  . Arris claims these two modems will initially support 5 Gbps downstream and 2 Gbps upstream speed.At the moment, DOCSIS 3.0 is facilitating cable MSOs to explore new markets. The persistent slump in the video market is being compensated by broadband services in the cable telephony and high-speed Internet markets. Escalating demand for video-on-demand has made DOCSIS 3.0 essential for cable MSOs. In addition, demand for online gaming and downloading of various multimedia applications has also increased manifold.Importantly, leading cable MSOs like Comcast Corp.  , Liberty Global Plc.  and Videotron Ltd. are keen on deploying DOCSIS 3.1 network, starting 2016. Full scale deployment is likely to take place in 2017 when Cox Communications is also expected enter the field.Meanwhile, the DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem market is expected to become increasingly competitive in the near future with companies like Cisco Systems Inc.  , Technicolor and Pace Plc. set to enter the market. Several other cable TV equipment manufacturers are also in the fray. In such a competitive scenario, Arris will likely be in a position to derive the maximum benefit as the forerunner of this technology.Arris currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ast week, most of the telecom stocks lost their value. The devaluation was in line with the broader market (S&P 500) movement owing to serious concerns over global economic growth, specifically the continued meltdown in China. However, this did not keep the telecom sector from witnessing consequential activities.Leading national telecom carrier Sprint Corp.'s  decision to not take part in the 600 MHz low-band spectrum auction to be conducted by the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in early 2016, grabbed much attention. We believe, one of the reasons behind Sprint's decision is its weak financial condition. The company has been witnessing losses annually since 2007.Also, last week, leading cable MSO (multi service operator) and media company, Comcast Corp.  , came up with two important announcements. The companyhas launched a beta-trial run of its digital video platform - Watchable. Through this offering, Comcast plans to foray into the highly lucrative digital advertising market.The full version of the service is likely to be made available by the end of fall this year. Moreover, Comcast revealed that its NBC Universal division is set to acquire a 51% stake in Osaka-based Universal Studios Japan, for $1.5 billion.Meanwhile, U.S. telecom behemoth AT&T Inc.  recently declared that it expects to add more than 2 million net subscribers for its wireless operations in the third quarter-2015. Both postpaid and prepaid categories are likely to witness significant customers gain. AT&T also reaffirmed its forecast for full-year adjusted profit and revenue growth despite a $1.1 billion charge that the company might have to incur on account of DIRECTV's Venezuelan assets owing to exchange rate fluctuations in the country.On the other hand, El Economista recently reported that Mexican telecom regulator - IFT -- is considering restricting AT&T from bidding for all of the 80 MHz of wireless spectrum across various Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) bands, scheduled to be auctioned in Jan 2016. Notably, the company has decided to invest $3 billion to expand high-speed mobile Internet network in Mexico.Additionally, a recent report by The Wall Street Journal stated that U.S. telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc.  might soon strike an outright purchase or a leasing deal with DISH Network Corp.  for the latter's spectrum assets. Recently, at a Goldman Sachs investor conference, Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam stated that the company has been in talks with DISH over some kind of arrangement pertaining to the latter's spectrum holdings.Outside the U.S., the merger negotiations between U.K. telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc  and leading European cable MSO Liberty Global plc  came to an end after both the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations. The discussions mainly focused on a series of transactions such as global asset swaps. However, the companies have not been able to determine the value of the resources to be exchanged which would help derive the maximum synergies. (Read the last  .)1. One of the reasons behind Sprint deciding to skip the Incentive Auction could be its weak financial condition. However, in doing so, the company will lack significantly in terms of network quality compared to other established players. The 600 MHz low-band broadcast TV spectrums will be utilized by wireless operators to expand and strengthen their 4G LTE networks. (Read More:  .)2. Comcast's ad-supported Watchable platform offers content from 30 digital content developers. Initially, customers will be able to view Watchable on Comcast's Xfinity X1 set-top boxes and online at Watchable.com as well as on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets through iOS compatible applications. Applications for Android compatibility will also be available soon. (Read More:  .)3. In 2014, the government of Mexico introduced reforms within its telecommunications sector which led to intensifying competition. Earlier this year, AT&T entered the Mexican telecom industry with the acquisition of Grupo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico. With these acquisitions, AT&T currently possesses more spectrums in AWS bands than any other wireless operator in Mexico. (Read More:  )4. Sprint is currently struggling for survival in the U.S. market. The stock price has plummeted a disappointing 21% over the last six months. Further, it is facing cut-throat pricing competition in the domestic telecom industry. This is invariably taking a toll on its financial health. Despite this, it would not be wise to write off Sprint immediately. Management has taken several steps for a turnaround, which can bring its business back on track if implemented properly. (Read More:  )5. Comcast has been focusing on its theme park business of late, pouring in billions of dollars in this field. The company foresees huge opportunities in international markets. Recently, Comcast announced plans of boosting its international operations through mergers and acquisitions. Over the last three to four years, theme parks have spelled success for Comcast. (Read More:  .)The following table shows the price movement of major telecom players over the past week and the last six months.

eading cable multi service operator (MSO) Liberty Global plc  has armed itself with ARRIS Touchstone TG2492 Gateway to support its high-speed broadband internet and streaming services. The device was developed jointly by Liberty Global, ARRIS Group Inc.  and Compal Electronics of Taiwan. The company announced its wide-scale deployment of the gateway device, starting with Telnet customers in Belgium and UPC customers in Romania, followed by an expansion in the American markets later. In Feb 2015, ARRIS had secured a 4K video gateway deal with Liberty Global.The flagship Touchstone TG2492 wireless gateway is touted to deliver best-in-class Wi-Fi performance, faster speeds, and improved connectivity for an expanding number of consumer devices. With consumers increasingly using streaming services for watching Internet TV through mobile devices, the gateway is expected to provide Liberty Global a platform to offer more innovative media and IPTV services in the future.Another key feature of the device is the support it extends for IPv6, Business Services and Wi-Fi Hotspots. This helps extend the reach of network deployment for operators. Since Wi-Fi calling is gaining momentum, these features can be a potential game-changer for Liberty Global and challenge wireless giants like Verizon Communications Inc.  and AT&T Inc.  , who recently received a nod from the FCC to deploy their own Wi-Fi calling services. Moreover, the gateway upgrade will also spur growth in Liberty Global's business services segment and boost its presence in the global push for Internet of Things (IoT) development.Liberty Global is rapidly expanding its global presence. It recently reached an agreement to buy Caribbean cable operator Cable & Wireless Communications plc. Moreover, it is keen to deploy the DOCSIS 3.1 (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) protocol which allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was specifically designed as the cable TV industry's answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators.While the cable-TV business is gradually depleting with subscribers shifting preference to content-based Internet TV service providers like HULU and NetFlix Inc., the high-speed Internet business is gaining ground. With such multiple diversification measures, Liberty Global is well positioned for organic growth going forward.Libety Global presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he anti-trust regulatory body, European Union (EU) Competition Commission recently launched an in-depth investigation under the EU Merger Regulation to assess whether the proposed acquisition of the Belgian telecom operator BASE N.V. by European cable TV behemoth  will harm the competitive landscape of the Belgian wireless market.Notably, in Apr 2015, Liberty Global entered into an agreement to take over BASE from its current owner Royal KPN N.V. for €1.33 billion (approximately $1.4 billion). At present, the Belgian wireless market is served by four wireless operators. Excluding BASE, Belgacom and Orange SA  controlled Mobistar are two other major carriers.The Telenet brand, operated by Liberty Global, draws up the fourth major carrier in the country. Telenet mainly offers cable TV and high-speed broadband services. However, Telenet also acts as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) offering wireless services using Mobistar's network infrastructure. As of Jun 30, 2015, Telenet had 953,700 mobile customers whereas BASE services boasted around 3.2 million customers.The primary concern of the EU telecom regulatory authorities is that if Telenet and BASE merge, the total number of wireless service providers will come down to three. The merged entity - Telenet and BASE - and Mobistar will hold 30% of the market share each while Belgacom will command a major 40% market share.Therefore, the consolidation of wireless carriers will lead to a much diminished choice of operators and higher prices for the customers. Additionally, after the merger, BASE may no longer offer its network to be used by other MNVOs.The EU regulators have until Feb 18, 2016, to take a decision. The antitrust body may either clear the deal or may block it or can even ask Liberty Global for more concessions to complete the merger. Last month, Liberty Global had offered certain concessions (which are still undisclosed) in order to clear the regulatory hurdle. However, it failed to convince the regulatory authority.On principle, the EU Competition Commission has been taking a tough stand on any merger proposal especially if the deal has the potential to reduce the competitive power of that given market.In Nov 2014, Liberty Global acquired full control of Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO in the Netherlands, where Liberty Global had existing operations under the UPC brand.To complete the takeover, the company vended its premium pay-TV channel ""Film1"". Furthermore, Liberty Global has provided an assurance that it will not prevent online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc.  from accessing its web (Internet) network either contractually or technically for eight years.Last month, the EU Competition Commission thwarted an attempt by the Scandinavian telecom operators Telenor ASA and TeliaSonera AB to merge their operations in Denmark. Reuters reported that Hutchison Whampoa's British subsidiary 3 UK is set to face an extensive regulatory investigation over its bid for Telefonica SA's  British unit O2 for which the deal was announced in Mar 2015.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ast week, most of the major developments in the telecom industry revolved around AT&T Inc.  , which is firing on all cylinders. The U.S. telecom behemoth finally received a waiver from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) for its impending WiFi calling service. The launch had so far been delayed as the FCC required the feature to support teletypewriter service (TTY) which assists hearing-impaired users.In addition, AT&T has reached an agreement with mass media service provider Viacom Inc.  for content distribution. Per the new distribution deal, Viacom will continue to provide media content to AT&T's satellite and fiber-based DIRECTV and U-Verse subscribers.Moreover, AT&T's Business Solutions division has decided to introduce an innovative Managed Internet Service on Demand as part of its Network on Demand platform, which will enable its large business customers to easily add or change network services in near real-time.Meanwhile, two affiliates of satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp.  withdrew their claim on around $3.3 billion worth of AWS-3 spectrums, the auction for which was completed in Jan 2015. In August, the FCC had unanimously voted against DISH's claim of a small business discount for its twin affiliates.On the other hand, leading U.S. national telecom carrier Sprint Corp.  cited plans to lower its costs by $2-$2.5 billion by implementing job cuts. The process, if executed, will be the second such plan to be realized in the last 12 months. In Nov 2014, Sprint had announced a $1.5 billion cost-cutting plan which involved axing 6.5% of its existing workforce.Outside the U.S., Canadian diversified telecom operator Rogers Communications Inc.  initiated plans to roll out its Ignite Gigabit Internet service that will offer Internet speed of 1 Gbps to 4 million Toronto residents. The company will deploy this service across its entire cable footprint in Ontario and Atlantic Canada by the end of 2016.Mexico's telecom regulatory authority - Federal Telecommunications Institute - stated that wireless tower operator Telesites, which was recently spun off from America Movil SAB  , will not require institutional approval to begin operations. Telesites will be enlisted on the Mexican stock exchange.Meanwhile, the anti-trust regulatory body, European Union (EU) Competition Commission, recently launched an in-depth investigation under the EU Merger Regulation to assess whether the proposed acquisition of Belgian telecom operator BASE N.V. by European cable TV behemoth Liberty Global Plc.  will harm the competitive landscape of the Belgian wireless market. The EU regulators are expected to reach a decision by Feb 18, 2016.(Read the last  .)1. AT&T intends to incorporate the novel Real Time Text (RTT) technology for the hearing impaired, within its Wi-Fi calling feature instead of the teletypewriter service (TTY). Apart from this, the company is looking to beef up security in its data providing services through partnerships with the likes of IBM. (Read More:  .)2. DISH's affiliates - Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless - gave up 197 spectrum licenses worth $3.3 billion to the FCC as they were denied the discount sought earlier by the company. Moreover, the affiliates had to pay a penalty of $413 million to the FCC for failing to make the payment within the stipulated period. The 197 licenses surrendered will be put up for sale post the FCC's broadcast airwaves auction scheduled for early 2016. (Read More:  .)3. Sprint is looking forward to strong earnings, going ahead that should lend confidence to its stakeholders. Reducing operating costs is one of the primary strategies that the company has undertaken to achieve the same. On this account, Sprint has decided to sit out of the upcoming 600 MHz low-band airwaves auction. While this will allow the company to save cash, it will potentially limit the company's scope for network upgrades and expansion, which may hurt its operations in the long term. (Read More:  .)4. The primary concern of the EU telecom regulatory authorities is that if Telenet, a division of Liberty Global and BASE merge, the total number of wireless service providers will come down to three from four in Belgium. Therefore, the consolidation of wireless carriers will lead to a much diminished choice of operators and higher prices for the customers. Additionally, after the merger, BASE may no longer offer its network to be used by other MNVOs. (Read More:  .)5. Telesites has a portfolio of about 10,800 wireless towers and provides extensive network coverage in Mexico. The Mexican government presently estimates that the country needs around 80,000 radio base-stations, which is more than four-fold its current availability. This indicates massive growth potential for the tower operators. (Read More:  .)The following table shows the price movement of major telecom players over the past week and the last six months.
  
Over the last five trading sessions, all of the major telecom stocks traded in the green. This was in line with the broader market movement as the S&P 500 index was also up nearly 4.00% in the last week. Sprint and America Movil gained a substantial 19.53% and 6.59%, respectively, during the said period.However, over the last six months, the price performances of key telecom stocks have been mostly negative with a notable exception of T-Mobile US, which gained 22.41% over the same period. Meanwhile, America Movil and DISH lost a significant 15.36% and 16.33%, respectively over the past six months.We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week. Therefore, we expect stocks to trade in line with the broader market movement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download  .

he merger negotiations between U.K. telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc  and cable TV behemoth Liberty Global plc  have come to an end after both the companies failed to reach an agreement on valuations.The discussions mainly focused on a series of transactions such as global asset swaps, as stated by Vodafone earlier.However, the companies have not been able to determine the value of the resources to be exchanged which would help derive the maximum synergies. Another major roadblock was the low level of diversification at Vodafone and the threats it faces from competitors in Europe as well as other markets.Nonetheless, sources close to the matter have revealed that the companies might resume merger talks in the future.Interestingly, Vodafone was particularly interested in Liberty Global's Western European operations. Meanwhile, Vodafone had been planning to vend its businesses in the Middle East and Africa.On the other hand, an association with Vodafone would have allowed Liberty Global to offer quad-play bundled services including video, landline phone, broadband data (Internet) and wireless services. Liberty Global offers both basic and digital video services, telephony and high-speed Internet (broadband) offerings whereas Vodafone provides 4G LTE and LTE-Advanced wireless networks and fixed-line broadband.Thus, a merger would certainly have helped the companies achieve economies of scale to remain competitive in certain markets, specifically Western Europe.Meanwhile, over the last couple of years, the U.K. telecom sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidation. Also, introduction of latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition.In Feb 2015, BT Group plc  had entered into a definitive agreement with Orange SA  and Deutsche Telekom AG to acquire a 100% stake in U.K.-based wireless operator EE. Moreover, in Mar 2015, Telefonica SA  divested O2, its wireless carrier in the U.K., to Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.Meanwhile, Vodafone acquired the fixed broadband infrastructure of Cable and Wireless in Jul 2012 to strengthen its network in the U.K. Thus, Vodafone's recent endeavors reflect its interest in fortifying its footprint in Europe to stay abreast and also counter competition in the U.K. telecom sector.Vodafone currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

eading cable MSO (multi service operator) and media and entertainment firm  foresees huge opportunities in the overseas market.The company aims to boost its international operations by focusing on merger and acquisition (M&A) activities. In addition, Comcast is looking to cash in on the growth opportunities in the emerging markets of China, India and Latin America. Notably, strength in international markets helps media firms fend off woes like declining TV ratings and advertising issues.Having acquired the entire stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co., Comcast is leaving no stone unturned to revamp Universal Pictures amid intense competition. In 2014, revenues from the Filmed Entertainment segment of NBC Universal declined 8.2% year over year to $5 billion, reflecting lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Interestingly, this segment has already exceeded the full-year 2014 total revenue figure so far this year. This should naturally ramp up Comcast's top as well as bottom line for the year.Moreover, for the first eight months of 2015, Universal Pictures' worldwide box office collection was roughly $6 billion, outpacing the previous record of $5.53 billion in full-year 2014 achieved by 20th Century Fox. Notably, both  and  grossed more than $1 billion at the international box office.We expect the studio's strong business momentum to continue through the rest of 2015 and garner more international revenues for the company.In a bid to expand its business ties with China, Comcast's NBC Universal division - commonly known as NBCU - has signed a multi-year movie distribution deal with Alibaba Group Holding Limited  .Per the deal, NBC Universal will distribute both new and old titles on Alibaba's new streaming service, Tmall Box Office (TBO). Universal Pictures' recent global hits  ,  and  , which is set for a 3D release in China over the weekend, are all part of the deal. Interestingly,  and  made almost $400 million and $230 million, respectively, at the Chinese box office.Meanwhile, Comcast has been pouring money into its theme park business for future growth. Likewise, NBC Universal is constructing a $3.25 billion park in Beijing, in partnership with a consortium of Chinese companies, which is slated to open in 2019.Moreover, Comcast and Liberty Global Plc.  have formed an alliance to offer the industry's first international WiFi roaming connectivity. The cross-continent WiFi interoperability will provide a free alternative to wireless data roaming facility.Though NBC Universal presently collects roughly 20% of its revenues internationally, the deal with Alibaba should give a boost to the company's plans to expand its businesses overseas. Moreover, the partnership will aid the company to amplify its reach and garner more traction in the market, as well as drive international revenues.Thus, with its latest endeavors, Comcast aims to catch up with rival media moguls like The Walt Disney Company  and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.  .Further, Comcast is interested in attaining additional live sports content and is also looking to invest in new content to target the youth keeping in mind the shift to Internet-based video viewing habits.Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is the largest international cable company with operations in 14 countries providing video, broadband Internet, fixed-line telephone and mobile services to its customers. In the second quarter, investors cheered as Liberty Global and Vodafone entered into formal talks over potential business combinations within their European operations. Although no formal details were released, Wall Street analysts began speculating on the potential for very large cost savings, and shares of both companies appreciated nicely. By the end of the third quarter, however, talks between the two broke down without any deals announced. Such a transaction had not been part of our investment thesis.

ccording to recent Bloomberg reports, the merger negotiations between U.K. telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc  and cable TV behemoth Liberty Global plc  is currently in stalemate. The discussions covered a range of transactions including a series of asset swaps between the companies' global operations.Vodafone had earlier stated that it is seeking an asset swap rather than a merger. However, the companies have not been able to determine the value of resources to be exchanged which would help derive the maximum synergies. Another major concern is the low level of diversification at Vodafone and the threats it faces from competitors in Europe and other markets. A merger between these companies would certainly help the companies achieve economies of scale to remain competitive in certain markets, specifically Western Europe.Meanwhile, an association with Liberty Global will allow Vodafone to expand its operations by offering quad-play bundled services like video, landline phone, broadband data (Internet) and wireless services. Liberty Global offers both basic and digital video services such as telephony and high-speed Internet (broadband).Notably, Vodafone recently reached an agreement with Qualcomm Inc.  to utilize the latter's L band spectrum for the deployment of 4G services.Some analysts contend that it would be Vodafone's loss if the deal fails to materialize as the deal would provide significant diversification benefits to Vodafone.Meanwhile, the deal may be subjected to anti-trust scrutiny. Recently, a merger between Danish telecom operators Telenor and TeliaSonera was blocked by the EU's competition commission, casting a shadow over mobile consolidation strategies in Europe. Certain other European telecom operators like Deutsche Telekom AG are already against the proposed merger of Vodafone with Liberty Global.Over the last couple of years, the U.K. telecom sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidation. Introduction of latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition in this market.In Feb 2015, BT Group plc  entered into a definitive agreement with Orange SA  and Deutsche Telekom AG to acquire a 100% stake in U.K.-based wireless operator EE.

 , a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe, is scheduled to release its second-quarter 2015 results on Aug 4, after market close.Last quarter, the company incurred a loss significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss, resulting in a mammoth negative earnings surprise of 916.67%. Moreover, the company's bottom line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 395.70%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.Robust demand for its digital cable-TV services, enhanced broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, strong cash flow, rising popularity of Horizon TV services and continuous expansion of next-generation services should aid Liberty Global's financial performance in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Liberty Global's consistent expansion in the Irish market lends optimism and should help the company check its declining subscriber count therein.However, stiff competition, saturated demand in European markets, high integration risks and mounting programming expenses are certain factors that may weigh upon the quarter's performance. Moreover, the prevailing foreign exchange rate volatility may further impact earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. : Liberty Global has an earnings ESP of -20.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of earnings stands at 4 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 5 cents. : Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Note that, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies that you may consider instead as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc.  , which has an earnings ESP of +4.35% and a Zacks Rank #1.Sprint Corp.  , which has an earnings ESP of +25.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Walt Disney Company  , which has an earnings ESP of +2.16% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Liberty Global Plc (Symbol: LBTYA) saw new options begin trading this week, for the November 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the LBTYA options chain for the new November 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $47.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $47.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LBTYA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $48.04/share today.Because the $47.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.53% return on the cash commitment, or 28.96% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, and highlighting in green where the $47.50 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of LBTYA stock at the current price level of $48.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.51% if the stock gets called away at the November 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if LBTYA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Liberty Global Plc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing LBTYA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

uropean cable TV behemoth  is on the verge to deploy a £3 billion ($4.75 billion) network infrastructure upgrade project in the U.K. The project will initially start from Manchester, where the company will spend £75 million ($119 million) for connecting 150,000 premises, reaching total coverage to around 450,000 premises in the city.Liberty Global offers basic and digital video services, along with telephony and high-speed Internet (broadband) services. In Jun 2013, the company acquired British cable MSO, Virgin Media. The acquisition places Liberty Global as the largest cable TV MSO (multi-service operator) in the world and a formidable challenger to BT Group Plc.  and British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. in the U.K.Liberty Global currently serves around 12.6 million homes and office premises in the U.K. The network infrastructure upgrade program will enable to the company to expand its coverage to another 4 million homes by 2020. The company uses its cable-based DOCSIS 3.0 technology to offer a maximum data transfer speed of 152 Mbps.Over the last couple of years, the UK telecom sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidation. Introduction of latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition in this market. In order to attain economies of scale in order to remain competitive, several telecom companies are looking for merger options in a bid to offer quad-play services of wireless, wireline, high-speed Internet (data) and video services.In Feb 2015, BT Group entered into a definitive agreement with Orange SA  and Deutsche Telekom AG to acquire a 100% stake in U.K.-based wireless operator EE.

.K. telecom giant  has started offering fixed-line broadband (Internet) service to residential customers on its home ground.Named Vodafone Connect - the new service is being offered in three tiers - Broadband (ADSL up to 17Mbps), Superfast Fibre (FTTC up to 38Mbps), and Ultrafast Fibre (FTTC up to 76Mbps). The service will initially be available to existing customers in select locations only and that too at a cheaper price. Nevertheless, the company intends to offer the service to new customers later in the year as well.Vodafone will utilize the fixed broadband infrastructure of Cable and Wireless, which the company had acquired in Jul 2012, to provide the service. Earlier, the company provided fixed broadband service in the U.K. using BT Group plc's  network. Though the agreement ended in late 2011, Vodafone will require BT Group's Openreach FTTC cabinets to offer its new service.We note that Vodafone specifically intends to minimize its customer churn rate with its Connect service as an increasing number of its subscribers are opting for attractive bundled services offered by its competitors. Moreover, it anticipates covering 60% of its footprint in the UK with fixed broadband network by the end of 2015.Meanwhile, outside the U.K., the company has been enjoying strong fixed Internet operations in Germany since it acquired Kabel Deutschland. Vodafone is also building a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network in Spain in collaboration with Orange  .Moreover, Vodafone is the first wireless carrier in the U.K. to have commercially launched LTE-A (Long-Term Evolution Advanced) service in Oct 2014. Management plans to roll out its LTE-A network across the U.K. within a year. The company aims to offer three times faster data transmission speeds on LTE-A compared with the traditional 4G LTE network.On the flip side, introduction of latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition in the U.K. telecom sector. In order to attain economies of scale to remain competitive, several telecom companies are looking at merger options in a bid to offer quad-play services of wireless, wireline, high-speed Internet (data) and video services.In Feb 2015, BT Group entered into a definitive agreement with Orange and Deutsche Telekom AG to acquire a 100% stake in U.K.-based wireless operator EE. Notably, BT Group already holds significant presence in the U.K. broadband market and this deal should solidify its position further.We believe Vodafone's plans for fixed broadband service introduction in the U.K. is an attempt on it part to maintain its position in the wireless market amid strong rivals like BT Group. The company also plans to commence the sale of Internet-based TV services by the latter half of this year to provide the best of bundled TV, broadband and mobile services to its customers.Meanwhile, according to a recent Bloomberg report, Vodafone and cable TV behemoth Liberty Global plc  are negotiating a possible asset swap deal. Currently, the negotiation is at a preliminary stage and neither side has officially confirmed anything.Nevertheless, Bloomberg reported that the discussion pertains to a range of transactions including a series of asset swaps of the two companies' global operations.

PC Ireland, a subsidiary of  has decided to pay €80 million for the acquisition of free-to-air Irish TV broadcaster TV3 from private equity firm Doughty Hanson. Initially the deal was worth around €73 million. UPC Ireland has agreed to pay €7 million extra if TV3 meets certain unspecified performance targets.Apart from its main TV3 terrestrial channel, TV3 also owns the channel 3e, TV3+1 and the TV3.ie website. After public broadcaster RTÉ's flagship channel RTÉ1, TV3 is Ireland's second most popular channel with an audience share of 12%. Notably, TV3 was acquired by U.K. private equity group, Doughty Hanson, for €265 million, in 2006. However, the equity group has been looking to vend the channel for some time now.In recent years, Liberty Global has been extensively investing in the Irish market. The company already owns UPC Ireland - a leading cable TV, telephone and broadband company. Moreover, last year, it purchased Irish Wi-Fi provider Bitbuzz.

Moreover, UPC (28.8%) is the country's second-largest residential fixed broadband provider after Eircom (35.8%). We believe that the TV3 acquisition will help the company check its declining subscriber count in Ireland. However, the materialization of the deal might take some time required for obtaining regulatory approvals.In a separate development, last month, U.K. telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc.  announced that it is in talk with Liberty Global regarding the exchange of certain telecom assets between the two companies.

Over the same time frame, the company's second-quarter earnings estimate has scaled down to a loss of 5 cents from a profit of 5 cents.Also, Liberty Global posted disappointing financial numbers in the first quarter of 2015 First-quarter net loss per share of 61 cents was significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. Notably, in the quarter, the company had added just 68,000 organic revenue generating units, down a whopping 81.6% year over year.Stiff competition, saturated demand in European markets, high integration risks and mounting programming expenses are major headwinds for the company at present. Liberty Global is also facing considerable foreign exchange rate fluctuations as it operates in 14 countries outside the U.S. Meanwhile, the prevailing foreign exchange rate volatility may further impact earnings in the forthcoming quarters.Liberty Global exited the first quarter of 2015 with nearly $42.8 billion in debts.

 , a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe, is scheduled to release first-quarter 2015 earnings results on May 7, after market close.Last quarter, the company had delivered a huge 616.67% negative earnings surprise. Moreover, the company's bottom line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 212.96%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.We believe Liberty Global should benefit from strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media, enhanced broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, strong cash flow and growing popularity of Horizon TV services.Notably, in Nov 2014, the company acquired full control of Ziggo N.V. - the largest cable MSO in the Netherlands. Furthermore, Liberty Global has assured that it will not prevent online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc.  from accessing its web (Internet) network either contractually or technically for eight years.On the flip side, stiff competition, high integration risk, mounting programming expenses and saturated demand in European markets may hamper profitability at Liberty Global in the first quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. : Liberty Global has an earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at a loss of 6 cents. : Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

The company saw loss in the quarter in contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of net income. The top line also failed to meet the mark.Recently, Charter made two major announcements pertaining to pending deals. The company has reached an agreement to buy Time Warner Cable - the second largest cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S. The value of the deal stands at $78.7 billion, including debt. Taking into account Time Warner Cable's diluted shares outstanding as of Mar 31, the value of the stock portion of the deal has been pegged at $55.76 billion. Moreover, as per the latest quarterly report, Time Warner Cable has long-term debt of $22.64 billion.We remind investors that in Jan 2014, Charter had offered $132.50 per share of Time Warner Cable, including $83 in cash. However, the company had lost to Comcast's higher bid of $158.82 per Time Warner Cable share. Meanwhile, in the month of Apr 2015, Comcast had put an end to its 14-month long negotiation of the $45.2 billion takeover deal concerning Time Warner Cable owing to strong reservations expressed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice.Also, Charter will take over Bright House - the sixth largest U.S. cable operator - for $10.4 billion. The Time Warner Cable and Bright House deals are likely to benefit Charter in terms of geographic expansion and operating cost synergies, which will in turn boost its bottom line and free cash flow. Charter will also be able to offer enhanced services and more streaming video product options.At the end of the quarter under review, Charter had $20,964 million of outstanding debt compared with $21,023 million at the end of 2014.

hares of  gained 3.15% on May 28 to close the day's trading at $39.99. The surge came following the news that IMAX's Chinese unit (IMAX China Holding) has filed an application with the Hong Kong stock exchange to get the shares of the division listed on the unit. Additional details about the proposed initial public offering (IPO) have not been revealed.The move is in line with the company's objective to expand in China where the rapidly growing movie market offers significant commercial potential. China had 239 IMAX screens at the end of the first quarter of 2015 (the comparable figure at the end of 2012 was only 128). IMAX states that 219 more theaters are scheduled to be set up in China by 2021. The company intends to set up a digital re-mastering facility in China to convert Chinese-language movies to the IMAX format. The facility is expected to be fully functional by Dec 31, 2015. IMAX's growth in China has benefited from its associations with Chinese media companies, including Wanda Cinema.The tremendous potential of the movie market in the country is highlighted by China's box-office revenues that surged approximately 36% year over year to $4.77 billion in 2014. Riding on the growth potential, the Chinese division of IMAX generated profits of $22.6 million in 2014, up 29%. IMAX intends to make the Chinese market its largest, going forward. The tremendous potential of the Chinese movie market has prompted several analysts to believe that it will surpass the U.S. movie market by 2019/2020.We believe investors will remain glued to updates on the proposed IPO. Meanwhile, IMAX is expected to gain from blockbuster Hollywood releases, increasing number of theater installations, higher backlogs and a growing presence in China, going forward.IMAX currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

DIRECTV's customers will now be able to access Ultra HD content using a DIRECTV Genie HD DVR and a supporting 2014 Samsung Electronics Ultra HD TV.On the flip side, management expects cost per user to rise in the range of 7% to 9% by 2016, mainly on account of contract renewals. Also, the company's deal with National Football League (NFL), which expired at the end of 2014, will account for the raised cost per user as DIRECTV was paying $1 billion every year to NFL.Also, sluggish growth in the Latin-American region is a major concern for DIRECTV. In the Latin American segment, quarterly ARPU stood at $43.52 as against $48.83 in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, average monthly churn rate in the U.S. for the reported quarter was 2.34% as compared with 2.13% in the prior-year quarter.DIRECTV currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in this sector include Comcast Corporation  , Liberty Global plc  and TELUS Corporation  .

The raised dividend will be paid on Jul 1, 2015 to shareholders of record as of Jun 15, 2015.

.S. stocks remained firmly in the red on Friday after data showed payrolls increased much more than expected in May, underpinning the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this year. Also weighing on sentiment was Greece's decision to delay a payment to the International Monetary Fund while it also rejected a proposal from its creditors.May nonfarm payrolls jumped by 280,000, beating the consensus of 220,000 and coming in near the top end of the consensus range between 190,000 and 289,000. For April, the figure was revised down by 2,000 to 221,000.

eportedly, French billionaire Patrick Drahi's Altice SA is interested in buying leading cable MSO (multi service operator) -  . However, the discussion is still at a nascent stage and may not reach any conclusion. Following the news, the company's shares gained 1.3% yesterday in after hour trading session.Altice is also in talks to purchase U.S cable company Suddenlink Communications. The value of the deal may be anything between $8 billion and $10 billion, including debt. Altice's keenness in taking over U.S cable companies clearly hints at the European company's interest in cross-border expansion.In the previous month, Comcast Corp.  dropped its 14-month old $45.2 billion worth of takeover deal concerning Time Warner Cable owing to strong reservations expressed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice. In this context it is worth noting that Charter Communications, Inc.  had initially expressed its desire to acquire Time Warner Cable and had placed the bid for the same.Elaborating on this, in Jan 2014, Charter Communications had offered $132.50 for each share of Time Warner Cable, including $83 in cash and $49.50 for each Charter Communications stock. The deal is valued at around $37.3 billion. Following the culmination of the deal, Time Warner Cable stockholders will own 45% of the merged entity. However, the company lost to Comcast's higher bid which offered $158.82 per Time Warner Cable share.Charter Communications had earlier intended to place a renewed bid for Time Warner Cable if Comcast fails to clear the regulatory hurdles. After Comcast formally exited the Time Warner Cable deal, the rumor of a Charter Communications-Time Warner Cable merger resurfaced. Nevertheless, several industry researchers have opined that Time Warner Cable may not accept a bid valued anything less than $160 per share.Time Warner Cable currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in this sector is Liberty Global plc  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

.S. cable multi service operator (MSO) Charter Communications Inc.  recently inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with leading video and broadband gear manufacturer, ARRIS Group, Inc.  for the acquisition of ActiveVideo Networks - a provider of cloud-based interfaces and applications.The purchase price of ActiveVideo stands at around $135 million. Per the deal, ARRIS will hold 65% of the joint venture company and will work as the sales channel partner for ActiveVideo's CloudTV platform. The deal is expected to be sealed in the second quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory approvals.Notably, ActiveVideo's CloudTV platform allows delivery of next-generation user interfaces, video-on-demand content and interactive advertising for TV to millions of set-top boxes and connected devices by virtualizing consumer premises equipment (CPE) functions in the cloud.Interestingly, Charter Communications has been using ActiveVideo's platform to power its novel, fully featured, cloud-based Spectrum Guide. The company expects to launch Spectrum Guide on its Worldbox, as well as on other legacy set-top boxes currently deployed within its coverage area.Similarly, ARRIS plans to speed up adoption of ActiveVideo's technology by capitalizing on its service provider relationships, worldwide reach and existing portfolio of CPE customers. Moreover, the deal should also help ARRIS in further extending its long-standing business ties with Charter Communications.ActiveVideo boasts a remarkable customer base which includes leading U.S. cable MSOs - Cablevision Systems Corporation  and Time Warner Cable Inc.  . In addition, it serves Liberty Global plc  - the leading cable MSO in Europe and several other notable companies globally.Thus, we believe the move to buy ActiveVideo is a strategic fit for both Charter Communications and ARRIS. While the former would be in a position to shore up the continual innovation and marketplace implementation of ActiveVideo's solutions, the deal should help ARRIS in strengthening its patent cloud portfolio further.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Warren Buffett has made billions of dollars by simply buying stocks and holding them for the long term.In fact, he’s made more than $70 billion through his buy-and-hold investing style, and ranks as the  according to Forbes.While you may not be able to become a multibillionaire like the Oracle of Omaha, replicating his strategy isn’t hard to do. When he bets, he bets big — more than  is allocated to just four stocks — and he usually wagers correctly.Luckily for us common folk, the acquisitions that Buffett makes through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (, ), are disclosed to the SEC and become public knowledge the quarter after their purchase.Last quarter, Buffett snapped up the following five stocks at a blistering pace. Two stocks were already owned by Berkshire, while three of them were entirely new additions to the portfolio.Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR), the parent company of the fast food chain Burger King and the Canada-based restaurant Tim Horton’s, saw Buffett  of preferred shares as well as common stock valued at $330 million. But the specific terms of the deal are what make Buffett the legend that he is.First of all, his preferred shares pay a 9% dividend annually, a rate that’s essentially impossible to find in investments with a similar risk profile, especially in today’s low interest rate environment. Through his $3 billion investment, Berkshire controls 13% of the voting shares in the company.But what’s far more interesting is the $330 million in QSR common stock Buffett now owns. As part of his agreement with QSR, Berkshire was given warrants to buy 8.4 million shares of common stock for 1 cent per share. With the QSR stock price trading around $32 at the time, Berkshire exercised its warrants for a cost of about $84,000, .While retail investors will never be able to swing these type of sweetheart deals, it could bode well for QSR stock. Back in 2011, Bank of America Corp () turned to Buffett for a . At the time its shares traded for $7.55 a pop, and less than four years later they have more than doubled.Buffett’s Berkshire already owned a few million shares of Precision Castparts Corp. (PCP), but it increased its holdings by 37% last quarter. Buffett likes large, predictable businesses that won’t go out of style any time soon, and PCP certainly fits that mold.The company makes castings, fasteners and other parts that are widely used by industrial and power companies to make end products of their own. The large majority of PCP’s customers , with Boeing Co () and Airbus Group (OTCMKTS:) registering as some of the company’s largest clients in the commercial space.PCP also sells to the military, with 11% of total sales coming from that division last year. PCP stock is down 16% in the last year, so investors have a rare chance to buy the stock at a cheaper price than Buffett himself did with his most recent purchase.Warren Buffett also hiked his investment in cable company Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR) considerably last quarter, upping his stake by 25%.CHTR competes with a handful of large-cap rivals in the area, such as Time Warner Cable Inc (), DirecTV (), Dish Network Corp () and others. (Buffett also owns DirecTV stock and increased that position by 4.5% last quarter.)While Charter isn’t currently profitable, it’s growing. Revenue growth has actually been accelerating for the last three fiscal years, increasing from 2% per annum in 2011 to more than 11% annually in 2014.In a cutthroat industry that’s increasingly consolidating, I wouldn’t be shocked to see a CHTR stock buyout in the next few years. Unless the cord-cutting trend swiftly upends cable as we know it, Charter should be a safe stock pick going forward — Buffett’s favorite.Warren Buffett continues to go long on the media industry. Through Berkshire, Buffett purchased 4.7 million shares of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA) stock in the fourth quarter.On top of initiating a position in FOXA and increasing his take in CHTR and DTV stock, he also boosted his investment in Liberty Global () — a cable provider in Europe, Chile, Puerto Rico and other countries across the globe.Ironically, it’s not news that Buffett is crazy for media companies; Berkshire owns 30 daily print newspapers in 11 states. FOXA owns Fox-branded networks including Fox News and Fox Sports, and also produces TV shows and movies.Although FOXA is expected to see slumping revenues this year, EPS is projected to jump 9.6% in fiscal 2015 and 21% in fiscal 2016. Trading at 8 times earnings and dishing out a 0.8% dividend, the stock looks like a steal at current levels.Last and most certainly not least, Buffett made a major addition to his portfolio, accumulating  in Deere & Company (DE), the business behind the iconic John Deere brand.DE stock is now one of the 15 largest positions in Berkshire’s portfolio and it’s already starting to pay off. Not only does DE stock boast a 2.7% annual dividend that Berkshire will be enjoying for years to come, but Berkshire’s already seen more than $100 million in capital gains since its purchase last quarter.As InvestorPlace feature writer Dan Burrows notes, . With crop prices suffering, farmers have less money to spend on equipment, so Deere hasn’t been doing so hot recently. But agriculture is a notoriously cyclical area, and Buffett loves to buy at the bottom.Plus, the company is managing this pullback better than it has previously:“Deere & Company is forecasting a much better performance in 2015 versus prior downturns in the agricultural market. From 1990 to 1992, Deere & Company’s net income fell about 90%. In the downturn of 1998 to 1999, net income tumbled roughly 77%.But as for this latest round of retrenchment — from 2013 through 2015 — Deere & Company expects net income to fall less than 50%.”So, there you have it.

"n Mar 30, 2015, Zacks  upgraded  by a notch to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Liberty Global reported dismal fourth-quarter 2014 financial results. The company posted loss in the reported quarter while the Zacks Consensus Estimate projected a net gain. The top line also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company is gradually establishing a strong foothold in the European cable multi service operator (MSO) market.We believe that the long-term fundamentals of the company are quite compelling, primarily owing to strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media, enhanced broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, strong cash flow and the growing popularity of Horizon TV services. However, stiff competition, saturated demand in European markets, high integration risks and mounting programming expenses may act as headwinds.In the coming years, we expect Liberty Global to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe and Latin America. Liberty Global continues to offer download speeds in between 100 and 150 Mbps across most of its markets. Moreover, the company plans to enhance download speed by deploying the DOCSIS 3.1 technology. Additionally, in 2014, the board of directors of Liberty Global authorized a $4.5 billion share buy-back program for a period of two years.In Nov 2014, Liberty Global acquired full control of Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO in the Netherlands. In order to complete the takeover, the company sold its premium pay-TV channel - Film1. Furthermore, Liberty Global provided the assurance that it will not prevent online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. from accessing its web (Internet) network either contractually or technically for a period of eight years. Meanwhile, Ziggo competes directly with Royal KPN N.V. and Vodafone Group Plc in the Netherlands.On the flip side, the company is predominantly operating in Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable region. Ongoing debt crisis in several European countries may significantly affect the future prospects of Liberty Global. The company is gradually concentrating on western Europe and some Latin American countries. Liberty Global exited the fourth quarter of 2014 with nearly $44.6 billion of debt. Regular share repurchases coupled with acquisition plans will not only undermine the company's cash flow but also expand its leverage position.Better-ranked stocks in the sector are Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd.  , Vonage Holdings Corporation  and The Walt Disney Company  .

tocks headed south Friday following an above-consensus rise last month in the core-CPI indicator, with the rising inflationary pressures seen as providing the Federal Reserve with the ammunition it needs to soon begin raising interest rates.All three benchmark indices recently were in holding patterns - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 inching lower while the Nasdaq Composite index just above its break-even mark - ahead of Fed Chair Janet Yellen presenting her economic outlook for the country in a 1 p.m. ET speech before the Providence Chamber of Commerce.Stock futures were cautiously higher ahead of this morning's data releases, buoyed by firm overseas markets and expectations for central banks around the world to maintain accommodative monetary policy actions. Mostly upbeat corporate earnings from John Deere (  ) and Hewlett Packard (  ) also contributed to the rising tone before equities surrendered those minimal gains after the CPI dataRising healthcare and housing costs elevated consumer prices during April as the nominal CPI increased an as-expected 0.1%. Excluding fuel and food costs, consumer prices climbed 0.3%, topping expectations for a benign 0.1% increase and marking the largest monthly gain in more than two years. Investors responded by taking stocks slightly lower, believing the higher-than-expected inflation data increses the likelihood for the Fed to raise interest rates in September.European markets finished mixed with EU-zone markets drifting lower with the U.S. despite a beat by the German Ifo business climate index.

 (  ) is gradually establishing a strong foothold in the European cable market. The company reported mixed third-quarter 2014 financial results wherein revenues failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while earnings surpassed the same.In the coming years also, we expect Liberty Global's revenues to continue to benefit from its triple play offering of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more bundled customers in Europe and Latin America. The company also continues to offer download speeds between 100 and 150 Mbps across most of its markets.Moreover, the company plans to enhance download speed further by deploying the DOCSIS 3.1 technology going ahead. Additionally, the board of directors of Liberty Global decided to authorize a $4.5 billion share buy-back program over the next two years.In Sep 2014, after the receipt of regulatory approval, Liberty Global and Discovery Inc. closed the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media for $1 billion. Before this, in May 2014, Liberty Global formed a partnership with Discovery Communications to buy All3Media completely. Earlier, owned by its founders and Permira funds, All3Media comprised 19 production houses across Europe and the U.S.Last month, Liberty Global acquired around 6.4% of ITV plc, the largest commercial TV broadcaster in the U.K., from British Sky Broadcasting Group plc for a total consideration of GBP 481 million (around $824 million). Hence, we believe that such strategic buyouts will not only drive RGUs (revenue generating units) but will also boost the company's subscriber base moving ahead.On the flip side, the pay-TV market of Germany has become highly competitive. Vodafone group plc, a global telecom giant, is on the verge of acquiring Kabel Deutschland, the largest pay-TV operator in Germany. Germany is the fastest growing economy in Europe and its cable TV market is highly lucrative. Thus, any change in government policy may impact Liberty Global's subscriber growth.Liberty Global exited the third quarter of 2014 with nearly $39.5 billion of debt. Regular share repurchases coupled with acquisition plans will not only undermine the company's cash flow but will also expand its leverage position, moving ahead. In addition, Liberty Global's plan to buy back shares worth nearly $3.1 billion in the 2014--2015 period and debts of around $12 billion due to mature by 2019 will severely hurt the company's cash position.Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in this sector include BlackBerry Ltd.

 (  ), a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe, is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter 2014 financial numbers on Feb 12, 2015, after market close.In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 42.86%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.Going forward, we believe Liberty Global's revenues will continue to benefit from its triple-play offering of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more bundled customers in Europe and Latin America. We believe the long-term fundamentals of the company are quite intriguing, thanks to strong demand for its digital cable-TV services and the growing popularity of Horizon TV services.Moreover, the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media and the takeover of around 6.4% stake in ITV plc - the largest commercial TV broadcaster in the U.K., should drive RGUs (revenue generating units) as well as boost the company's subscriber base, moving ahead.However, recessionary pressure in the European region, stiff competition, mounting programming expenses and saturated demand in European markets may act as headwinds for Liberty Global in the future. Also, low per capita income may stall people from spending more on exorbitant high-speed bundled communication and HD-DVR-based digital video services. Moreover, business integration risks persist as Liberty Global has recently acquired several companies, either partially or fully.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. : Liberty Global has an earnings ESP of -75.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 3 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 12 cents. : Liberty Global's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. Nevertheless, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Grupo Televisa, S.A.B. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +13.51% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Cablevision Systems Corporation (  ) has an earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #3.Comcast Corporation (  ) has an earnings ESP of +1.30% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ast week witnessed many significant developments in the telecom industry. On the net neutrality front, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finally proposed new laws which will classify high-speed broadband (Internet) under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.However, the proposed law does not include retail price control on broadband services. Net neutrality does not include rate regulation, tariff regulation and last-mile unbundling.In fact, ISPs (internet Service Provider) will enjoy the upper hand in levying charges on some specialized broadband services.Meanwhile,  (  ) settled antimonopoly charges with Chinese regulatory authority National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The company agreed to pay $975 million in fine and will also offer several royalty concessions for its licensing business in China.In a separate development,  (  ) commercially launched Sling TV, its first Internet TV venture. Further, in an attempt to lure customers from its closest rival DIRECTV, the company has offered a guaranteed savings of $250 per annum to all DIRECTV customers who are willing to switch over to DISH.Additionally,  (  ) plans to open mini-shops in as many as1,750 of RadioShack's stores in order to revamp its telecom businesses.1. The FCC chairman Mr. Tom Wheeler proposed new net neutrality laws which will classify high-speed broadband (Internet) as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act. The reclassification will allow the government to strongly regulate ISPs. Notably, the five-member regulatory body will vote on this proposal on Feb-26.In Nov 2014, President Obama strongly endorsed net neutrality to bring out a radical change in the way the government treats high-speed broadband service. Net neutrality implies an open-Internet atmosphere which will prohibit ISPs, especially the telecom and cable TV operators, from discriminating against contents and applications. (Read More:  .)2. Qualcomm has reached an agreement with Chinese regulatory authority, NDRC, settling the 15 month old antimonopoly charges against the company. As a settlement, Qualcomm will pay a fine of $975 million together with several royalty concessions to Chinese handset developers. Meanwhile, the company's management also raised its financial outlook for fiscal 2015.The Chinese wireless market is currently the major growth area for Qualcomm. Qualcomm generates 74% of its revenues from chipset sale but earns 58% of its profit before tax from high-margin licensing business which generates massive royalties.In fiscal 2014, the company generated nearly 50% of its global revenues ($26.5 billion) in China, with a large chunk of profit coming from higher-margin royalties earned from the company's licensing business. (Read More:  .)3. Recently, DISH commercially launched its Internet TV service called ""Sling TV"". With this, the second largest satellite TV operator in the U.S. forayed into the over-the-top video delivery market. Availability of Internet TV at an exceptionally low price along with the accessibility to some top-rated TV channels such as ESPN of  (  ) may become a game changer for the pay-TV industry while posing significant threat to cable MSOs. Most importantly, the Sling TV service will be available for as low as $20 a month to view sports, lifestyle, family and news networks. (Read More:  .)4. Recently, DISH launched a value-themed campaign targeting its closest rival DIRECTV customers. With the program, DISH assures $250 of savings per annum to all DIRECTV customers for the same programming and services they are presently availing if they choose to switch over to the former's network.Toward this end, DISH has set up a website, dishchallenge.com, where DIRECTV customers can register for the promotion, which runs through Apr 8. DISH believes that this strategy will help it to lure high-valued cost-conscious customers from DIRECTV. Over the last three years, DISH also made several technological advancements related to its video delivery. (Read More:  .)5. Sprint is set to open mini-shops in as many as 1,750 of RadioShack's stores. The expansion is part of Sprint's plan to spur a turnaround and revamp its sinking business by adding more retail locations. Last week, RadioShack filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The beleaguered electronic and mobile products retailer is looking to close the rest of its U.S. stores and is also in discussions to sell its remaining overseas assets.Sprint has jumped at the opportunity. Per the deal, Sprint would effectively manage a small shop within a larger RadioShack store, taking up around one-third of the retail space at every location.

panish telecom behemoth  has decided to divest its U.K. wireless operations, which run under the O2 brand, to Hutchison Whampoa. Notably, Hutchison currently operates under the 3 UK brand in the nation. At present, O2 serves over 22 million customers. Together the joint entity will have a consolidated subscriber base of more than 30 million, which will form the largest wireless operator in the U.K.The total consideration of the deal stands at GBP 10.25 billion (approximately $15.25 billion). Hutchison will initially pay a total of GBP 9.25 billion (around $13.75 billion) with an additional deferred payment of GBP 1 billion (about $1.5 billion). The deal is expected to be completed by Jun 2016, subject to customary regulatory approval. Earlier, Hutchison had reached an agreement with Telefonica to acquire the latter's mobile operations in Ireland.Telefonica has been seeking a suitable way of divesting its UK operations for quite some time now. Meanwhile, UK telecom giant BT Group has been planning to re-enter the wireless segment and was eyeing incumbents like O2 and EE as possible takeover targets. Finally, in Dec 2014, BT settled for EE, which is jointly controlled by Orange  and Deutsch Telekom AG.Over the last couple of years, the UK telecom sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidation. Introduction of latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition in this market. In order to attain economies of scale to remain competitive, several telecom companies are looking for merger options in a bid to offer quad-play services of wireless, wireline, Internet and video services.The wireless and fixed broadband markets in the UK witnessed a series of consolidations. Vodafone Group Plc.  acquired the fixed-broadband businesses of Cable and Wireless. Moreover, cable MSO (multi-service operators) Liberty Global Plc  took over Virgin Media.Small-sized wireless operators such as Talk Talk and Sky are other potential acquisition candidates.

 (  ), the second largest cable multi service operator (MSO) in the U.S., is now bringing its all-digital TWC Maxx services to Kansas City, starting next week. This service will provide subscribers in the city, Time Warner Cable's ultra-fast Internet speeds, advanced TV services and top-class dependability.With the TWX Maxx initiative, Time Warner Cable aims to convert its network to an all-digital mode, doing away with the analog video channels. The TWC Maxx program retrieves bandwidth from analog video channels and uses the capacity to offer its subscribers faster broadband speeds and additional improved services, at no extra cost. Thus, as the conversion advances, subscribers in Kansas City will witness speed levels increasing from 15 Mbps to 50 Mbps, from 50 Mbps to 200 Mbps, and from 100 Mbps to 300 Mbps.Kansas City subscribers will also gain access to Time Warner Cable's next-generation whole-home DVRs. These boxes will allow them to watch and record 6 shows simultaneously, and record up to 150 hours of HD content apart from providing 1 TB of storage. Moreover, Time Warner Cable is also offering an all-digital TV lineup and an extended VOD library to its subscribers.In 2014, the company had duly completed the rollout of its Maxx program in Los Angeles and New York City, consequently gaining higher broadband subscribers in the third quarter. Time Warner Cable thereafter took the TWC Maxx initiative to Austin, TX in the latter half of 2014, and hopes to carry out the transition therein early this year.Notably, TWC Maxx upgrades are also expected to get underway in Dallas and San Antonio in the next few months, with Charlotte, Hawaii, Raleigh and San Diego lined up for the future. Moreover, Time Warner Cable aims to roll out TWC Maxx to all its markets through 2016.In Feb 2014, Comcast Corp. (  ) had reached an agreement with Time Warner Cable to acquire the latter in an all-stock deal valued at around $45.2 billion. Post-completion of the deal, existing Time Warner Cable's investors will hold about 23% of the merged entity. At present, the proposed merger between the two companies is under strict regulatory scrutiny. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2015.Time Warner Cable retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Liberty Global plc (  ) and DigitalGlobe, Inc.

ccording to a recent report of Financial Times, Spanish telecom behemoth  (  ) is currently in talks with Hutchison Whampoa to merge their respective wireless services operations in the U.K. Telefonica operates in UK under O2 brand whereas Hutchison operates as 3 UK.It was also reported that Telefonica intends to completely sell off O2 for a cash consideration of around $12 billion to $13.5 billion. However, neither of the entities has confirmed the news.Telefonica has been seeking a suitable way of divesting its UK operations for quite some time now. Notably, UK telecom giant BT Group Plc. (  ) has been planning to re-enter the wireless segment and was eyeing incumbents like O2 and EE as possible takeover targets.Finally, in Dec 2014, BT settled for EE, which is jointly controlled by Orange (  ) and Deutsch Telekom AG. Meanwhile, Hutchison has reached an agreement with Telefonica to acquire the latter's mobile operations in Ireland.Over the last couple of years, the UK telecom sector has been witnessing a wave of consolidation. Introduction of latest network technologies has significantly intensified competition in this market. In order to attain economies of scale to remain competitive, several telecom companies are looking for merger options to offer quad-play services of wireless, wireline, Internet and video services.Wireless and fixed broadband markets in the UK witnessed maximum consolidation. Vodafone Group Plc. (  ) acquired the fixed-broadband businesses of Cable and Wireless.Moreover, cable MSO (multi-service operators) Liberty Global Plc. (  ) atook over Virgin Media.

"inally, leading satellite TV operator  (  ) and Fox News have managed to seal a multi-year agreement pertaining to carriage fees, putting an end to a week-long dispute between the two companies.Henceforth, DISH's 14 million satellite TV customers will be able to watch two of the most viewed channels in the country - Fox News and Fox Business Network. On Dec 21, 2014, both the channels had been taken off air from DISH's offering after the two parties had failed to reach an agreement ahead of the contract expiry. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.In the recent past, DISH has faced contract renewal issues with several other cable TV content providers. In Nov 2014, the company had experienced a similar setback with CBS Corporation that resulted in a brief shutdown of few local CBS stations.Incidentally, DISH has been persistently losing pay-TV customers. Had the company failed to reach an agreement with Fox News, the company's churn rate would have worsened further in the coming quarters. Last quarter, the company lost 12,000 pay-TV subscribers. Average monthly pay-TV subscriber churn rate in the third quarter stood at 1.67% compared with 1.66% in the prior-year quarter.Of late, DISH Network unveiled its Internet TV service - ""Sling TV"" - at the International Consumer Electronics Show. Technically, Internet TV is similar to cable/satellite TV services. Subscribers opting for Sling TV will have to pay as low as $20 a month to view 12 Nielsen-rated sports, lifestyle and family and news networks.

"n extensive wireless spectrum portfolio, innovative product launches like Internet TV service, higher ARPU and a video streaming deal with Disney are factors that are likely to spur growth for  (  ), going forward.DISH recently unveiled its Internet TV service named ""Sling TV"" at the International Consumer Electronics Show. We believe the growing deployment of super-fast 4G LTE wireless technology and significant adoption of portable mobile devices are primary reasons behind the growing popularity of Internet TV. The company's Internet TV service was earlier scheduled for a mid-2014 launch. However, management now states that the service will go live from the first quarter of 2015.Subscribers opting for Sling TV will have to pay as low as $20 a month to view 12 Nielsen-rated sports, lifestyle and family, and news networks. Notable among these channels are ESPN and Disney Channels of The Walt Disney along with HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel of Scripps Networks Interactive. Customers will also be able to access add-on packages for an additional $5 per month.In June 2014, DISH had achieved a significant milestone by commercially launching the first wireless set-top box in the pay-TV industry. Subscribers using this box can connect to DISH's flagship Hopper Whole-Home HD DVR through a dedicated 802.11ac access point and watch TV shows on any device in and around the home through a wireless Joey device.On the downside, in the third quarter of 2014, substantial promotional activities drove the company's subscriber-related expenses up by 7.9% year over year. The company lost 12,000 pay-TV subscribers in the quarter. Moreover, DISH exited the reported quarter with nearly $11.8 billion of debt. Such high debt levels may impede the company's plan of acquiring a wireless carrier in the near future.Moreover, rising programming costs and increasing churn rate may act as headwinds for the company. Average monthly subscriber churn rate for the pay-TV in the quarter stood at 1.66% compared with 1.67% a year ago. At the end of the third quarter, DISH Network had approximately 14.041 million pay-TV subscribers, down 0.1% year over year.DISH currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in this sector include Liberty Global plc (  ), Intelsat S.A.

anada's largest cable MSO and wireless operator -  (  ) and the country's leading telephone operator -  (  ) have reached an agreement to jointly own Canadian retailer, Glentel Inc. Per the deal, BCE will divest 50% of its ownership stake in Glentel to Rogers, following which both the companies' will have equal possession of Glentel's Canadian retail operations.Glentel, with roughly 500 wireless outlets in Canada, sells a wide variety of wireless products and services from different carriers, including Rogers. This agreement thus makes it convenient for customers to purchase Rogers' products and services across the country.In return, Rogers has agreed to pay BCE 50% of the Glentel transaction value in cash. This should significantly trim BCE's cost to take over Glentel and help the company successfully complete the pending acquisition.Initially, Rogers had sought to block BCE's acquisition of Glentel. As per Rogers, its agreement with Glentel required that the Canadian retailer obtain Rogers' approval before divulging its control to another company. However, under this newly formed venture, Rogers has agreed to withdraw its application and not pose any further challenges to BCE's acquisition plans for Glentel.Notably, on Nov 28, 2014, in an effort to enhance its retail presence in Canada, BCE had agreed to purchase Glentel for $586 million. The deal is expected to be sealed by the end of the first quarter of 2015, subject to consent from shareholders and regulators. We believe BCE's decision to acquire Glentel will help the company ramp up its wireless revenues, increase average revenue per user (ARPU) and curtail churn rate.Vonage Holdings Corporation (  ) and Liberty Global plc (  ) are some of the better-ranked stocks worth considering in this sector over the near term.

"n Jan 3, 2015, Zacks  upgraded  (  ), a leading cable multi-service operator in Europe, by a notch to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Ever since the company announced robust third-quarter 2014 earnings on Nov 6, shares have gained about 9% riding on positive estimate revisions. Liberty Global posted adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents.Notably, the company's strength is evident in multiple areas, and we believe that its revenues will continue to benefit from its triple-play offering of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe and Latin America.Also, upward estimate revisions reflect optimism regarding the stock's prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 moved north by 26.9% to a loss of 19 cents per share from a loss of 26 cents over the last 60 days. Similarly, for 2015, the estimates moved up by 118.5% to 59 cents for the same time period. On a year-over-year basis, earnings are expected to surge about 403.6% in 2015.Going forward, we believe that the long-term business fundamentals of the company are very intriguing, primarily owing to strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media, faster broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, strong cash flow and the growing popularity of Horizon TV services.Black Diamond, Inc.

 's (  ) 14 million satellite-TV customers are now on the receiving end of a spat between the former and Fox. Two of the most viewed channels in the country - Fox News and Fox Business Network - were taken off air from DISH's offering after the two parties failed to reach an agreement ahead of the expiry of their contract on Sunday.DISH Network and New York-based Fox are now caught in a blame game regarding the blackout of the channels. DISH has accused Fox of introducing new channels that were not part of the contract slated for renewal, thus violating contract negotiations. Fox, on its part, maintained that they were willing to renew the contract on similar terms but DISH Network's demands were different. Moreover, Fox charged DISH Network for prematurely shutting down service 10 minutes before the scheduled time of contract expiry.In recent times, DISH has been facing contract renewal issues with several other cable TV content providers. Last month, the company had a similar setback with CBS Corporation (  ) which resulted in a brief shutdown of few local CBS stations.DISH has been persistently losing pay-TV customers. A failure to come to terms with Fox might result in further customer churn and falling average revenue per user in the coming quarter. Last quarter, the company lost 12,000 pay-TV subscribers.

" string of innovative service launches like ""Ethernet@Home"" coupled with higher demand for metro Ethernet services are likely to spur growth for  (  ) in the coming quarters. In addition, investment plans in China to build a theme park in Beijing also bodes well for the company over the long term.Comcast is aggressively targeting the small and medium-sized business (SMB) segment, which remains the core area of telecom operators. Various industry researchers estimate that the SMB segment is expected to offer a $20-$30 billion market opportunity. Comcast's Business Hospitality division provides an integrated package of voice trucking, Ethernet-based Internet and HDTV services. Comcast recently launched an innovative service called Ethernet@Home. This will perform as an Ethernet Everywhere service through which a person will be able to enjoy extended and secured Ethernet connectivity anywhere, from office to residence. Ethernet@Home will provide an attractive 10Mbps of data transmission speed to users. The service will undoubtedly solidify Comcast's footprint in the metro Ethernet market.On the other hand, NBC Universal is investing around $3.3 billion to build a theme park in Beijing. Comcast has partnered with Chinese investors for the purpose. The company foresees huge opportunity in China as the country has 11 out of the top 20 amusement parks in Asia. Notably, nearly 166 million people thronged these parks in 2013. According to AECOM - a global architecture and engineering firm - 59 additional theme parks are in the pipeline for China. Interestingly, AECOM forecasts that China will overtake the U.S. in the theme park business by the year 2020.On the flip side, a major concern for Comcast is its spiraling programming expenses. Quarterly operating costs and expenses totaled $11,087 million in third-quarter 2014, up 2.5% year over year. Management also expects programming expenses to rise 9-10% in 2014, mainly attributable to higher retransmission and long-term renewal fees.Moreover, penetration of digital video customers is almost reaching saturation in the country. In the third quarter of 2014, Comcast lost 81,000 video subscribers. The company ended the quarter with 22.376 million video customers, down 0.7% year over year.Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in this sector include Liberty Global plc (  ), Time Warner Inc.

ontinuous elimination of low-quality customers, aggressive share repurchase plans and the launch of innovatiove services are likely to benefit  (  ), going ahead. On the other hand, competitive threats in the pay-TV industry, rising programming costs, foreign exchange currency risks and weakness in the company's Latin American operations pose near-term concerns for the company.DIRECTV has become the first multi-channel video provider to offer 4K Ultra HD programming directly on subscribers' TV sets. The company has launched the service in partnership with Samsung, a leading brand in UHD TVs. DIRECTV customers will now have access to Ultra HD content using a DIRECTV Genie HD DVR and a supporting 2014 Samsung Electronics Ultra HD TV. Through this service, DIRECTV will offer an array of fresh releases, popular movies and nature documentaries in 4K.On the other hand, for the Latin American region, DIRECTV has adopted a new set of strategies. These include: (1) gradual penetration since the pay-TV market is highly untapped; (2) utilizing favorable macroeconomic and demographic trends with both high-end and low-end cost-effective offerings; and (3) pursuing the next-generation wireless broadband and online on-demand video facilities. DIRECTV has initiated a massive marketing drive to attract customers to its exclusive programming.The Latin American region has been a major concern for DIRECTV. In the reported quarter, DIRECTV lost 119,000 subscribers in this region against an addition of 260,000 in the year-ago period, mainly due to stringent credit measures and lower promotional schemes. In the Latin American segment, quarterly ARPU stood at $48.88 as against $49.42 in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, average monthly churn rate in the U.S. for the reported quarter was 1.73% compared with 1.61% in the prior-year period.DIRECTV currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in this sector include Liberty Global plc (  ), Comcast Corporation (  ) and Time Warner Inc.

n Dec 31, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ). The company posted disappointing third-quarter 2014 financial numbers. The top and the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate; however, both increased on a year-over-year basis.During the third quarter, Time Warner Cable generated significant subscriber growth for its residential high-speed data and voice subscribers. Residential high-speed data subscribers rose by 92,000 to 11.507 million whereas voice subscribers grew 14,000 to 4.989 million. High-speed data revenues reached $1,620 million, up 10.9% year over year. The increase in high speed data revenues was driven by a surge in average revenue per user (ARPU).Moreover, the Business Services segment emerged as a major growth driver at Time Warner Cable. In the reported quarter, Business services revenues grossed $724 million, up 28.5% year over year. The company intends to double its revenues in this segment within the next 4 to 5 years.On the downside, rising programming costs pose a major threat to Time Warner Cable. Programming costs accounted for more than 36% of the company's total expenses in the third quarter. Average monthly video programming costs per video subscriber rose 11% year over year to $38.96. Over the last four years, programming costs per customer has grown 32%, primarily due to a rise in contractual rates with TV channels (content developers), especially sports channels.To add to the woes, Time Warner Cable is persistently losing video customers despite implementing several strategies. Meanwhile, large telecom players like AT&T and Verizon Wireless continue to gain video subscribers, offering stiff competition to the cable company.Time Warner Cable currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in this sector include Liberty Global plc (  ), DigitalGlobe, Inc.

The service is likely to be introduced in late 2015.Vodafone stated that it has more than 400 MNC customers in the U.S. and an additional over 500 MNC clients who are based outside the U.S. but have strong operations in that country. The new wireless service will strengthen Vodafone's existing offerings of U.S. and international fixed-mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) services.Vodafone's subscribers in the U.K. and other parts of the globe will get better roaming facility in the U.S. using its MVNO service. Recently, the company added 17 countries to its 4G LTE roaming facilities. At present, Vodafone offers LTE roaming services in 40 countries across the world. This vast mobile network will significantly help the company's roaming customers who travel a lot during holiday seasons.In Feb 2014, Vodafone divested its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications Inc.

ne stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is  (  ). This is because this security in the Cable TV industry space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Cable TV industry space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 70 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, Liberty Global is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term.In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from 16 cents per share to 21 cents per share, while current year loss estimates have narrowed down from 23 cents per share to 16 cents per share. This has helped LBTYA to earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), further underscoring the company's solid position.So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Liberty Global. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

eading satellite TV operator - DISH Network Corp. (  ) - has reached an agreement with Netflix, Inc. (  ) to integrate the latter's app into its set-top box. This will allow DISH's customers to watch Netflix movies and TV shows directly on their television sets. However, financial details of the deal were not disclosed.Incidentally, the Netflix app will be available only on DISH's second-generation Hopper digital video recorders. In June, DISH Network achieved a significant milestone by commercially launching the first wireless set-top box in the pay-TV industry. Through this, subscribers can connect to DISH's flagship Hopper Whole-Home HD DVR through a dedicated 802.11ac access point and watch TV shows on any device in and around the home using a wireless Joey device. A WiFi enabled set-top box is a significant innovation in the pay-TV industry as it eliminates the need for either coaxial or ethernet wiring within a customer's home premises.We believe the addition of the Netflix app to DISH's Hopper Whole-Home HD DVR set-top box will open up newer avenues for entertainment. This, in turn, will help DISH check its subscriber churn rate in the coming quarter. Average monthly pay-TV subscriber churn rate in the third quarter of 2014 stood at 1.67% compared with 1.66% in the prior-year period. At the end of the quarter, DISH had approximately 14.041 million pay-TV subscribers, down 0.1% year over year. Meanwhile, the company lost 12,000 pay-TV subscribers in the third quarter.We believe an extensive wireless spectrum portfolio, innovative product launches, higher ARPU, the renewal of a multi-year contract with Scripps Networks Interactive and a video streaming deal with Disney are likely to spur growth for the company, going forward.DISH currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in this sector are Comcast Corporation (  ) and Liberty Global plc (  ). Both these stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

"ast week, the telecom industry hit by a purple patch with all major telecom stocks losing value. This resulted from the disappointing financial outlook provided by telecom behemoths  (  ) and  (  ).Cutthroat pricing competition is compelling large telecom operators to indulge in higher promotional activities. While  (  ) is offering same data plan as Verizon and AT&T at 50% discount,  (  ) introduced a pocket-friendly LTE family data plan.Meanwhile, outside the U.S.,  (  ) has invalidated rumors of acquiring  (  ). Management further stated that the company is not considering any acquisitions in the U.K. at present. In a separate development, French telecom operator  (  ) is awaiting a decision from BT Group Plc on whether the latter wants to bid for EE in the U.K. by Christmas.Additionally, on the cable TV front,  (  ) recently introduced an innovative Ethernet Everywhere service called ""Ethernet@Home"" and  (  ) wrapped up its digital migration project.1. Telecom stocks took a beating yesterday after leading wireless carriers, AT&T and Verizon hinted at expectations of lower profits in the ensuing fourth quarter owing to intense competition. Yesterday, AT&T's chief financial officer expressed fears of facing considerably wider fourth-quarter churn rate than the year-ago quarter. However, the company expects to add customers in spite of this.AT&T also expects higher promotional expenses to hurt wireless service margins in the quarter. On Dec 8, 2014, Verizon announced expectations of lower earnings in the final quarter of 2014, owing to higher promotional expenses and price cuts. These strategies are likely to impact the company's wireless segment EBITDA and EBITDA service margin as well. (Read More:  .)2. T-Mobile US has announced the launch of a new family plan which offers unlimited talk-time, voice messages, text messages and 4G LTE data. While the other national carriers are still marketing their complex shared data plans, with this new scheme, T-Mobile aims to enhance value and benefits for customers while also simplifying it.The new Simple Choice plan begins at a nominal $100 per month for two people and is available from Dec 10, 2014 for a limited period. However, customers can carry on with the plan beyond the offer period. (Read More:  .)3.  (  ) has updated its financial outlook for 2014. The company raises its outlook as a result of its recent acquisition of AT&T's wireline operations in Connecticut.On Oct 24, 2014, Frontier Communications completed its $2 billion acquisition of AT&T's wireline operations in Connecticut and its related statewide fiber network and U-verse operations. The company will now offer broadband, voice, video and other products to residential and business customers in Connecticut. (Read More:  .)4. French telecom giant Orange expects to complete its operational restructuring process in Europe this year itself. The company is presently awaiting a decision from BT Group on whether it wants to bid for EE in the U.K. Notably, EE is jointly held by Orange and Deutsche Telekom of Germany.In the meantime, Orange is also positive about its proposed acquisition of Jazztel Plc., which offers broadband services along with fixed-line and mobile phones services to enterprise and consumer markets in Spain. (Read More:  .)5. Early this week, the rumour of Vodafone mulling over the acquisition of Liberty Global was making rounds of the U.K. telecom circle. However, the week comes to an end with Vodafone invalidating the Liberty Global merger talks. Vodafone is presently striving to fortify its fixed-broadband network. Vodafone expects introduction of fixed broadband service in the U.K. will help the company maintain its position in the wireless market as well. (Read More:  .)The following table shows the price movement of major telecom players over the past week and the last six months.
  
Over the last five trading sessions, the price movement of all major telecom stocks was negative. T-Mobile US lost the highest value of 10.46%. The substantial value loss can be attributed to telecom operator's concern over intense price competition.However, over the last six months, the price performance of key telecom stocks was mixed. China Mobile and DISH witnessed considerable rally in stock prices of 20.08% and 18.79%, respectively, while Sprint collapsed a massive 50.68% and T-Mobile US lost 24.00% of value over the same time frame.The ongoing AWS-3 spectrum auction conducted by the Federal Communications Commission has accumulated nearly $42 billion after the completion of 68 th round of bidding. The auction will continue in the coming week as well. Apart from this, we do not foresee any significant event in the telecom industry in the near future. Therefore, we expect stocks to trade in line with the broader market movement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download  .

 (  ) is trying to increase its revenues by boosting its operations in the North America data center sector through the acquisition of ViaWest Inc.Near-term catalysts include high-speed Internet and telephony subscriber gain, expansion of Shaw Go Wi-Fi networks, and increased number of applications supporting the Shaw Global Go TV Everywhere service.The company reported mixed financial numbers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 with the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line surpassing the same.Shaw Business - a division of Shaw Communications - plans to upgrade its Managed WiFi solution for clients operating in the hospitality industry. With the new Managed WiFi solution slated to be available from Jan 2015, hotels, inns, resorts, casinos and conference centers will be able to access Shaw Business' unmatched WiFi capabilities.Shaw Communications has sealed its previously declared acquisition of ViaWest Inc. for $1.2 billion. The takeover of this Colorado-based data-center provider will help Shaw Communications expand its data services and cloud capabilities business. ViaWest has 27 data centers in eight western U.S. markets which include Dallas, Denver, Las Vegas and Minneapolis. The company has gained significant synergies from its initial set-up of only five data centers in two markets.For fiscal 2015, management expects both total revenue and operating income before amortization to grow 5-7% year over year. Free cash flow is projected at $650 million. In order to boost its overall productive efficiency, Shaw Communications plans to streamline its organization structure into three segments, namely, consumer, business and media.On the downside, Shaw Communications exited the fiscal fourth quarter with nearly $4.3 billion debt as compared with $3.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.

harter Communications, Inc.'s (  ) agreement to take over cable TV customers from Comcast Corporation (  ) should significantly benefit the company over the long term.In Apr 2014, Charter Communications and Comcast had reached a strategic cable TV agreement. Last month, Comcast cut a deal with Time Warner Cable Inc. (  ) to acquire the latter. The merged entity of Comcast and Time Warner Cable will have around 33 million pay-TV subscribers. In order to avoid antitrust restriction, Comcast has decided to divest around 3.9 million Time Warner Cable video subscribers to Charter Communications to maintain its total market share at 30% of the U.S. pay-TV industry. The total deal size stands at approximately $20 billion.We believe this deal will benefit Charter Communications significantly as the company will achieve necessary scale to sustain itself in the intensely competitive U.S. pay-TV market.Unlike most of the cable TV operators, Charter Communications has successfully improved its Internet and telephony subscribers churn rate year over year in the third quarter. Its average revenue per user also increased 2% year over year.On the downside, online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc., Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable TV operators. Online providers offer a cheap source of TV programming unless a customer is eager to view real-time programs like sporting events. This business model is gaining momentum, especially in volatile economic conditions.Charter Communications currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock worth considering in this sector is Liberty Global plc (  ) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

elect leading pay-TV operators, content providers and equipment vendors from around the world have combined forces to form the Streaming Video Alliance (SVA) - a new industry forum.The move reflects the common vision shared by the participants with regard to the future of online video services. The group seeks to formulate industry-wide standards for high-scale Internet video services and improve productive efficiency for all providers involved in the process.The Streaming Video Group will try to establish deeper ecosystem collaboration, encouragement of an open infrastructure and functionality of network and cloud based streaming and caching to foster interoperability for streaming videos. The group also aims to set benchmarks for measuring and optimizing streaming video quality. Such standardizations will help ensure that customers enjoy the best video experience.The SVA's 17 founding members list includes a handful of major pay-TV operators, such as Comcast Corporation (  ) and Charter Communications, Inc. (  ) in the US; Liberty Global plc (  ) and Telecom Italia S.p.A. in Europe; KT Corp. in Asia and Telstra in Australia. The lineup also includes key online content providers such as Major League Baseball Advanced Media, Fox Networks Group, Limelight, Qwilt, Ustream, Wowza, Yahoo and Epix, as well as leading industry players such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (  ), Alcatel-Lucent (  ) and Level 3 Communications, Inc. (  ).It has been reported by some of the founding members of SVA that the industry group may eventually expand its coverage to matters such as encoding and 4K video streaming on the web, following it up with the best practices from providers and vendors. Furthermore, more vendors are expected to join this forum by early next year.Meanwhile, the emergence of the SVA coincides with the issue of net neutrality - an open-Internet atmosphere which will prohibit Internet Service Providers (ISPs), especially telecom and cable TV operators, from discriminating against applications - that has created considerable turmoil in the ISP industry. President Obama has asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reclassify high-speed broadband (Internet) as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of treating it under section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act. All ISPs, along with several cable and telecommunications industry bodies, have vehemently opposed this action.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" (  ), a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe, has recently received the European Union (EU)'s regulatory approval to acquire full control of Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO in the Netherlands. The company expects to close the deal in next month.At present, Liberty Global holds a 28.5% stake in Ziggo. Notably, the company will pay around $13.6 billion to acquire the remaining 71.5% stake including its outstanding debt. The deal will be completed through a stock and cash transaction.Prior to the approval, the deal faced close scrutiny by the EU Competition Commission as the regulator expressed its concern over the impact the merger will have on the Netherlands' cable TV industry and the Flemish-speaking areas of neighboring Belgium.In Jul 2014, Liberty Global offered some concessions to defend its case against the anti-trust regulatory body. As part of the concessions offered, the company has decided to vend its premium pay-TV channel ""Film1"".Furthermore, Liberty Global will not prevent online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (  ) from accessing its web (Internet) network either contractually or technically for eight years. Low-cost online video streaming service providers depend completely on Internet links for their offerings. In addition, Liberty Global has pledged not to discriminate against competitors that buy its content.Liberty Global boasts a strong presence in the Dutch cable TV market as its UPC Broadband Holding BV unit is the second largest cable MSO in the nation. A merger between Liberty Global and Ziggo will create a dominant cable TV operator in the Netherlands with approximately 10.8 million revenue generating units. Ziggo also competes with telecom operators such as Royal KPN N.V. and Vodafone Group Plc. (  ).During the last 6 years, Liberty Global has been striving to extensively penetrate the European pay-TV industry with its bundled video, voice and Internet (data) services. The European markets are still relatively untapped for this unique triple-play offering. At present, Liberty Global is also pursuing a systematic diversification in the content development segment apart from steadily strengthening its foothold in the European pay-TV market.In synergy with the latest policy, Liberty Global acquired TV content producer All3Media for $1 billion, in partnership with Discovery Communications Inc. (  ) in May 2014. In Jul 2014, the company acquired an approximate 6.4% stake of ITV plc, the largest commercial TV broadcaster in the U.K., from British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ), a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe, is scheduled to release its third-quarter 2014 financial numbers on Nov 5, after market close.In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a huge margin of 92.31%. Moreover, the company has delivered negative earnings surprises in three of the prior four quarters, with an average miss of 83.03%. Let's see how things are shaping up ahead of this announcement.Recently, the company received the European Union (EU)'s regulatory approval to acquire full control of Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO in the Netherlands. The merger will thus create a dominant cable TV operator in the Netherlands with approximately 10.8 million revenue generating units.Liberty Global boasts a strong presence in the Dutch cable TV market as its UPC Broadband Holding BV unit is the second largest cable MSO in the nation. We believe the long-term business fundamentals of the company are very intriguing, primarily owing to strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media, faster broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, strong cash flow, and the growing popularity of Horizon TV services.However, recessionary pressure in the European region, saturated European markets, stiff competition, high integration risks, foreign currency exchange rate risks, considerable debt and mounting programming expenses may act as headwinds for Liberty Global, moving ahead. Also, low per capita income may stall people from spending more on exorbitant high-speed bundled communication and HD-DVR-based digital video services.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below. : Liberty Global has an earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at 14 cents. : Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:BlackBerry Ltd. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +83.33% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Lumos Networks Corp. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +15.39% and a Zacks Rank #2.DragonWave Inc.

The year-over-year increase was driven by solid performance in the U.K, Germany and Belgium.Cost of operations was $3,793.5 million, up 1% year over year.

 could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for LBTYA broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 2.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for LBTYA stock.If that wasn't enough, Liberty Global isn't looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 1 estimate has been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for LBTYA.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n Oct 8, we issued an updated research report on  (  ). Liberty Global reported weak second-quarter 2014 financial results, wherein both its top and bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In the coming years, we believe, Liberty Global's revenues will continue to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe and Latin America. Liberty Global currently offers download speeds between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps across most of its markets. The company plans to enhance download speed further by deploying the DOCSIS 3.1 technology in the upcoming quarters.According to recent reports, Liberty Global is on the verge of receiving the European Union's (EU) regulatory approval to acquire full control of Ziggo N.V. - the largest cable multi service operator (MSO) in the Netherlands. In Jan 2014, Liberty Global had reached an agreement to acquire a 100% stake in the company. At present, Liberty Global holds a 28.5% stake in Ziggo. Liberty Global will pay approximately $13.7 billion to acquire the remaining 71.5% stake of Ziggo, including its outstanding debt. The deal will be completed by the end of 2014 through a stock and cash transaction.In Sep 2014, after receiving regulatory approval, Liberty Global and Discovery Inc. (  ) together sealed the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media for $1 billion. In May 2014, Liberty Global partnered with Discovery Communications to buy All3Media entirely.Comcast Corporation (  ) and Liberty Global plc - leading cable MSOs in the U.S. and Europe respectively - have formed an agreement to offer the industry's first international WiFi roaming connectivity to their subscribers. The service will start on a trial basis in late 2014 and will be offered commercially from 2015. Comcast has more than 3 million WiFi hotspots across the U.S. while Liberty Global has installed over 2.5 million WiFi home spots in various European countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland.On the flip side, Liberty Global continues to lose customers for its basic video offerings. In the second quarter of 2014, the company lost 72,000 video customers. Several European broadband service providers are gradually deploying high-speed DSL and Fiber-to-the-Home networks, making the industry extremely competitive. Further, we expect more cash-strapped consumers to downsize existing services, resulting in churn in the company's subscriber base.Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock worth reckoning in the sector is Cablevision Systems Corporation (  ), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Notably, the company will pay around $13.6 billion to acquire the remaining 71.5% stake in Ziggo including its outstanding debt. The deal will be completed through a stock and cash transaction.Meanwhile, the deal has faced close scrutiny by the EU Competition Commission as the regulator expressed its concern over the impact the merger will have on the Netherlands' cable TV industry and on the Flemish-speaking areas of neighboring Belgium.Last month Liberty Global offered some concessions to defend its case against the anti-trust regulatory body. As part of the concessions offered, the company has decided to vend its premium pay-TV channel ""Film1."" Furthermore, the company will not prevent online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc.

he global pay-TV industry is going through a volatile phase. The North American markets continue to witness significant video subscriber losses due to the emergence of cheaper online video streaming services. This incident has resulted in massive cord cutting.On the other hand, increasing competition, cut-throat pricing strategy and offering bundled-services at discounted prices are impeding revenue growth for European pay-TV operators.Over the last six years, the internal dynamics of the pay-TV market have been gradually shifting from cable/satellite TV offerings toward fiber-based video services of large telecom operators. Moreover, the strong presence of low-priced online video streaming service providers is posing a significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, the core business area of the cable/satellite TV operators, seems to be slipping out of their hands.Meanwhile, the global pay-TV industry is currently witnessing massive consolidation. It has become imperative for pay-TV operators to attain scale, higher productivity and effective cost management in order to survive the competition. This might have led to the proposed merger of nation's two largest cable TV operators, namely, Comcast and Time Warner Cable as well as the proposed merger of AT&T with DIRECTV.A major concern for the global pay-TV industry is the prolonged macroeconomic fluctuations resulting in uneven disposable income for households. Pay-TV operators are highly dependent on new households for strengthening their client base. Moreover, penetration of digital video customers is almost reaching saturation in the U.S.At this juncture, we believe investors should dump those stocks which carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank. Taking these factors into account, we present three such Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stocks for investors to avoid: (  ): The second largest satellite TV operator in the U.S. lost 44,000 video subscribers in the second quarter of 2014. Average monthly subscriber churn rate was 1.66% as against 1.42% in the previous quarter. DISH has developed a strong portfolio of wireless airwaves. However, management is undecided about its utilization so far.Meanwhile, in the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings fell by 1 cent and 11 cents for third-quarter 2014 and fiscal 2014, respectively. For the ensuing third-quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 41 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of a whopping 40.07%. The same for fiscal 2014 is pegged at $1.68, indicating a year-over-year decline of 9.95%. (  ): This leading cable MSO (multi-service operator) in Europe lost 72,000 video subscribers in the second quarter of 2014. The company is concentrating on western Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable region.Liberty Global has witnessed a negative average earnings surprise of a significant 83.03% for the last four reported quarters. For fiscal 2014, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined by 25 cents over the last 60 days and currently stands at 2 cents. This indicates a massive 92.86% fall year over year. (  ): The second largest cable MSO in Canada lost 12,075 cable video subscribers and 5,608 satellite TV customers in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Meanwhile, Shaw Communications is facing intense competitive pressure from Telus Corp. (  ). Moreover, considerable debt, rising capital expenditure and deteriorating cash position may act as headwinds for the company going forward.The company has generated a negative average earnings surprise of 4.47% for the last four reported quarters. Although, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 for fiscal 2014 reflects year-over-year growth of 5.12%, it deteriorated by 2 cents over the last 60 days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Jul 10, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  . (  ).Except for one quarter, Liberty Global has delivered negative earnings surprises in three quarters last year, with an average beat of negative 84.96%. The company reported first-quarter 2014 financial results, wherein both its top and bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We believe that the long-term business fundamentals of the company are very intriguing, primarily owing to strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, faster broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, strong cash flow and growing popularity of Horizon TV services. Based on these positives, the company posted narrower video subscriber loss in the reported quarter.In the coming years, we expect Liberty Global's revenues to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband, and telephone offering, as it has signed up more number of bundled customers in Europe and Latin America.Liberty Global also joined RDK Management LLC., a joint venture between U.S. cable giants  (  ) and  (  ). RDK Management sets standards and development procedures for Comcast's Reference Design Kit (RDK) for all-IP and hybrid IP/QAM set-top boxes and gateways. Liberty Global's inclusion in the consortium is likely to extend RDK's reach into several European marketsIn Jun 2013, Liberty Global recently completed the full acquisition of the British cable MSO, Virgin Media. The takeover places Liberty Global as one of the leading cable TV MSO (multi service operator) in the world. Additionally, the board of Liberty Global has decided to authorize a $4.5 billion share buy-back program for the next two years.However, stiff competition, saturated European markets, high integration risks and mounting programming expenses may act as headwinds for Liberty Global while moving ahead. Moreover, Liberty Global's plan to continue with its buyback plan coupled with debt maturity of around $12 billion by 2019 will severely hurt the company's cash position.Liberty Global is currently trading at significantly higher multiples with respect to several valuation metrics compared with the industry average and the S&P 500. We believe that this high level of valuation may restrict above-market gain anytime soon.Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 (  ) is set to release its second-quarter fiscal 2014 results before the opening bell on Aug 5, 2014.In the last quarter, the company delivered a negative 185.71% earnings surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Going forward, we believe Liberty Global's revenues will continue to benefit from a triple-play offering of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more bundled customers in Europe and Latin America.However, recessionary pressure in the European regions coupled with intense competition in the pay-TV market may act as headwinds for the company, going forward. Also, low per capita income may stall people from spending more on exorbitant high-speed bundled communication and HD-DVR-based digital video services. Moreover, business integration risks persist as the company has recently acquired several companies either partially or fully.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. The Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at 13 cents. Hence, the ESP is 0.00%. Liberty Global carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which increases the predictive power of ESP.However, we caution investors against the stock going into the earnings announcement, as an ESP of 0.00% combined with a Zacks Rank #3 lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise.Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Windstream Holdings, Inc. (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Cablevision Systems Corporation (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.Dish Network Corp.

" (  ), a leading cable MSO (multi service operator) in Europe, recently acquired an approximately 6.4% stake of ITV plc from British Sky Broadcasting Group plc. (BSkyB) for a total consideration of GBP481 million (around $824 million).ITV is the largest commercial TV broadcaster in the U.K. with a program line-up which includes top-rated programs like ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Got Talent"". BSkyB is partially controlled by the Fox Network of  (  ).In spite of a modest stake buy in ITV, the transaction signifies a strategic shift of Liberty Global's business model. During the last 6 years, Liberty Global has been striving to extensively penetrate the European pay-TV industry with its bundled video, voice and Internet (data) services. The European markets are still relatively untapped for this unique triple-play offering.However, growing popularity of online video streaming services and the evolving platform of Internet TV have changed the scenario radically. The market dynamics are gradually shifting toward content producers from cable TV operators as TV shows and films can be watched from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Since 2010, ITV has been focusing on investing more on contents and acquiring valuable production assets in order to offer an increased number of TV shows. This strategy has allowed ITV to reduce its dependence on volatile advertising revenues. In the U.K. ITV's closest competitor is Channel 5, a subsidiary of  (  ).Liberty Global is also pursuing a systematic diversification in the content development segment besides steadily strengthening its foothold in the European pay-TV market. In May 2014, Liberty Global acquired TV content producer All3Media for $1 billion, in a partnership with  (  ).Importantly, BSkyB will utilize the proceeds from the ITV stake sell to acquire more pay-TV assets. In this context, the company is in talks to buy its parent Fox Network's Italian and German businesses named Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, respectively.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

esterday, the anti-trust regulatory body, European Union Competition Commission, stated that it is evaluating the proposed merger deal between  (  ) and Ziggo N.V. In Jan 2014, Liberty Global had reached an agreement to acquire a 100% stake in Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in the Netherlands.The EU regulator had earlier rejected Dutch regulatory authority's plea to take over the case despite their claims of understanding the domestic market better. The EU regulatory body also remains concerned over the impact the deal will have on the Flemish-speaking areas of neighboring Belgium.At present, Liberty Global holds a 28.5% stake in Ziggo. Notably, Liberty Global will pay approximately $13.6 billion to acquire the remaining 71.5% stake in Ziggo including its outstanding debt. The deal will be completed through a stock and cash transaction. Per the deal, each Ziggo shareholder will receive €11.00 in cash, 0.2282 Liberty Global Class A ordinary shares and 0.5630 Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares.Liberty Global already boasts a strong presence in the Dutch cable-TV market as its UPC Broadband Holding BV unit is the second largest cable MSO in the nation. A merger between Liberty Global and Ziggo will create a dominant cable TV operator in the Netherlands with approximately 10.8 million revenue generating units. Ziggo also competes with telecom operators such as Royal KPN N.V. and  (  ).Liberty Global is striving to extensively penetrate the European region with its bundled video, voice and Internet (data) services. The European markets are still relatively untapped for this unique triple-play offering.The company has also joined the RDK Management LLC, a joint venture between U.S. cable giants  (  ) and  (  ). In 2013, Liberty Global acquired the license to test RDK standard in its next-generation Horizon IP video gateways.

 (  ) is trying to fortify its leading position in the European cable and TV industry. Recently, the company formed a 50-50 joint venture with  (  ) to acquire U.K.-based TV content producer group AII3 Media. The deal is valued at GBP550 million (approximately $932 million) and is expected to close by the third quarter of 2014, subject to customary regulatory approval.AII3 Media is currently controlled by private equity firm Permira Advisers LLP. The company's popular TV productions include  ,  ,  , to name a few. The company generated 505 million pounds in total revenue in the fiscal year ended Aug 2013. Both Liberty Global and Discovery will invest around GBP90 million in cash and the rest of the amount will be generated through equity and credit facilities raised at All3Media.Unitymedia GmbH, the German subsidiary of Liberty Global, is looking to expand its mobile stores Germany. Currently, the nation's third and fourth largest wireless operators, namely,  (  ) and Royal KPN N.V. are seeking regulatory approval for a merger between their German units. The European regulatory authority will deliver its decision on Jun 26, 2014.The merged entity will have more than 44 million mobile subscribers surpassing  (  ) and Deutsche Telekom AG. However, the regulator may ask the Telefonica-Royal KPN combine to divest some of their wireless customers and stores in order to control monopolistic power. Unitymedia is aiming to acquire these divested wireless subscribers and stores that will put up for sale.Currently, Unitymedia operates 300 mobile stores in west and southwest Germany where it offers triple-play broadband Internet, telephony and pay-TV bundle services. The company also provides mobile phone services to about 240,000 subscribers using Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG's network. Liberty Global currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).In Mar 2014, Bloomberg had reported that Liberty Global intends to establish a pan-European mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) system to provide mobile phone services.MVNO is a company which uses the established network infrastructure of an existing wireless operator to offer its own services. Consequently, the company will become a competitor to major wireless operators, such as Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Royal KPN N.V. and Belgacon.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"AudioCodes (  ) is an Over-the-Top investment in an Over-the-Top ((OTT)) world. However, it is being misinterpreted as a slow grower in the Unified Communications (UC) VoIP market and overlooked as an OTT mobility play. This couldn't be farther from the truth. AudioCodes needs to be recognized for its OTT ambitions and for its OTT opportunities that it has firmly in place. Since Facebook (  ) acquired WhatsApp the OTT world has been turned upside down on the service provider side of the equation. Here again, is why I believe investors, both retail and institutional need to stop and listen to my bullish stance on AudioCodes becoming an OTT solutions pure play in the near future. This opportunity, if played out by AudioCodes will make my $1.50 initiation to $9.12 high look like child's play.Over-the-Top as described by  refers to the delivery of video, audio and other media over the Internet without a multiple system operator (service provider) being involved in the control or distribution of the content.In May 2013, AudioCodes acquired the remaining interest in MailVision, a company that was designed to assist service providers in opening new markets via Wi-Fi and VoIP. Since that acquisition, AudioCodes has placed a heavy foot on spending R&D dollars into the OTT mobility space. In February 2014 at the Mobile World Congress it introduced its first cloud based OTT solution called Mobility Plus Business Edition for the enterprise.This system is parallel to the VMAS solution it already has installed at dozens of carriers in Europe and Latin America for consumers mostly on a trial basis (as we don't hear much from the company on the platform). AudioCodes, on the last conference call, spoke for the first time of its excitement on OTT mobility. This management team is a conservative, close to the vest type of group that in my opinion, wouldn't be talking up mobility unless something has changed dramatically.Here's what's changed dramatically; last month, Comcast (  ) announced that it had placed 1 million hot spots into its wireless Wi-Fi network to date. A milestone that got my attention, as I believe Comcast is or should be working with AudioCodes. Remember, Comcast was a big  and user of AudioCodes acquisition Nuera Communications, so the relationship could still be in place. Comcast didn't stop there; it followed the 1 million hot spots with an astonishing  of reaching 8 million hot spots by year end. This helped me see the full picture on how fast and how serious Comcast was to building out a Wi-Fi wireless network. Solidifying Comcast's commitment to its Wi-Fi network, this week it  that it signed a partnership with two Asian carriers, KDDI and Taiwan Mobile, to allow them to access its Wi-Fi network when in the States to avoid roaming charges. This partnership will allow KDDI and Taiwan Mobile subscribers to install an app on their phone that allows them to place Wi-Fi calls when in the states. The app will be branded for KDDI and Taiwan Mobile, but open up much like a Viber or WhatsApp.There's more. Last month in the Netherlands, UPC and Ziggo simultaneously  mobile Wi-Fi. This is important as Liberty Global Inc. (  ) is the parent company of both companies and is merging the two together. Liberty has been just as vocal as Comcast in the past few months talking about building 4 to 5 million hot spots and its own wireless network. It is also testing a MVNO/Wi-Fi network for its users. It would work like this, from Liberty's CTO  :Lastly, British Telecom (  )  that it's building out its own Wi-Fi wireless network. BT, which has been out of the mobile market for the last 10 years when it spun off its mobile division O2, is looking to make a comeback by converting its customers' 5 million broadband routers into a nationwide wireless Wi-Fi network. BT Broadband customers will be able to automatically access the BT Wi-Fi network when out of their homes and close to a hotspot. BT plans to expand its network overseas utilizing its 7 million Broadband customers overseas.Comcast, Liberty Media and BT are the companies at the forefront of answering customers' needs for Wi-Fi all the time. The growth in Wi-Fi usage is increasing dramatically as more and more people are using Wi-Fi to download movies, log on to the internet and text or Skype. They also want Wi-Fi so that they can talk using OTT applications. Looking at this trend it is becoming increasingly more apparent that all telecoms and cable providers are going to be forced to set up their own Wi-Fi networks or partner in building networks that their customers can use. I believe that this will be a tremendous opportunity for AudioCodes as we see the likes of AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), Sprint (S) and others add Wi-Fi networks.Both consumers and enterprises are very sensitive to roaming charges and the annual figures don't dispute that sensitivity. The consumer is more susceptible to roaming pricing than enterprises, but the right OTT network could influence both parties to attach themselves to a service provider's OTT Wi-Fi mobility app. The consumer and the enterprise will become more active users while saving money from not experiencing roaming charges. Informa Telecoms & Media reports; ""In 2011, 28 billion roaming minutes were delivered a number that is anticipated to almost double to 58 billion by 2015."" In addition, it reports that ""annual global roaming revenues will grow 86 percent from 2010-2015 rising from $42 billion in 2011 to $66.8 billion in 2015, accounting for approximately 6.3 per cent of total mobile service revenues."" These figures undoubtedly bring AudioCodes' voice engine and cloud based OTT mobility offering into play. I believe these data points could be the reason behind the upcoming big Wi-Fi networks rollouts which will be an opportunity for AudioCodes to service millions of subscribers as soon as year end. This business model is a revenue sharing model and it's one that flows straight to the bottom line, making it an extremely attractive asset for Audiocodes. Comcast's partnership mentioned above will allow it to generate new fees from a percentage of KDDI's and Taiwan Mobile's millions of subscribers, bringing added value to having a proper voice network with a superior voice engine.Here's a table on the above analysis:AudioCodes knows codecs (the compression and decompression of a digital data stream, or signal handled by special algorithms we call codecs (COder-DECoder)), it knows voice packets and it is singularly focused on VoIP. That's a lot of engineers and man hours centrally focused on real time OTT mobility. I addressed AudioCodes' ambitions one year ago but it has remained very quiet until this past conference call. On the  when the CEO talked so bullishly about OTT mobility, it lit a fire under me much the same as I believe Facebook's OTT ambitions has lit that same fire under the Service Providers. The game has changed. I believe Facebook, Liberty Media, Comcast, BT and a host of others will all come to AudioCodes at some point in the next 6-9 months as they own the best voice engine and have the best engineers working on next generation solutions in the OTT space.Benefits of AudioCodes' Mobility PlusWhen the institutions come to visit AudioCodes, have one on one meetings and look at the market drivers in voice networks, they'll see that AudioCodes is in a high barrier to entry position and its OTT mobility has high operating leverage and high gross margins that could one day make this company a ten bagger from today's $5.75 per share, in the next 12-24 months. The mobility arm of AudioCodes is the most underestimated and overlooked aspect of AudioCodes' R&D efforts and its product portfolio. At these depressed valuations vs. its direct peer, it's no longer time to sit on your hands, it's time to recognize how important AudioCodes' voice engine is to Wi-Fi mobility and how immensely profitable its business model will be.AudioCodes is trading at the same price level it was in November. It is sitting on $36 million more in cash, gross margins are at 2 year highs and inclined to break 60% next quarter; its quarterly revenues are $2 million higher and mobility is now being spoken of on a quantity level in the quarters to come. So what is the value of AudioCodes here vs. the opportunity? AudioCodes is trading at 1 times 2015 revenues less its net cash. Its chief competitor is trading at 2.2 times revenues less cash. In fairness, analysts see Sonus Networks (SONS) having a bigger SBC portfolio and a larger installed base at service providers and as such is deserving of a richer valuation. I believe buying AudioCodes on this recent selloff is the single best buying opportunity in my 2 years of recommending it, as the once thought about mobility play is here as per Comcast, Liberty Media and BT announcing its aggressive plans to build Wi-Fi networks. In buying the shares you're getting expanding margins, increasing revenues and a strong cash position to handle its core UC growth opportunities but you're also getting the upside of an exponential mobility opportunity.Chart:Looking at a longer term chart on AudioCodes we can see that this recent pullback has created a great buying opportunity and I will be looking for a reversal and a continuation of the W pattern. The next reversal, if it comes on the back of OTT mobility progress, should see the shares break out to new yearly highs and challenge multi-year highs.Conclusion:The shares of AudioCodes have been in a tsunami of their own, but the company is preparing for a Jim  mobile tsunami that I believe is sure to get the attention of the most aggressive growth funds. The shares are selling off not because of bad performance, but because of a poorly handled secondary and a small cap correction. The business is doing extremely well, the R&D efforts are off the charts with a $20 million dollar grant by the Israeli office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) (they're not dumb people) and the company is priced incredibly cheap with the mobility solutions they command for any service provider that wants a mobile OTT application. Once one deal lands, the rest will follow, as Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp has placed AudioCodes in an OTT position in what's looking to be an OTT world. I am long AUDC.

nitymedia GmbH, the German subsidiary of  (  ) is looking to expand its mobile stores in that country. Currently, Germany's third and fourth largest wireless operators, namely,  (  ) and Royal KPN N.V. are seeking regulatory approval for a merger between their German units. The merged entity will have more than 44 million mobile subscribers surpassing  (  ) and Deutsche Telekom AG.However, the European regulatory authority may ask the Telefonica-Royal KPN combine to divest some of their wireless customers and stores in order to eliminate monopolistic power. Unitymedia is targeting these divested wireless subscribers and stores that will put up for sale.Currently, the company operates 300 mobile stores in west and southwest Germany where it offers triple-play broadband Internet, telephony and pay-TV bundle. Unitymedia also provides mobile phone services to about 240,000 subscribers using Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG's network.Last month, Bloomberg reported that Liberty Global intends to establish a pan-European mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) system to provide mobile phone services. MVNO is a company which uses the established network infrastructure of an existing wireless operator to offer its own services. Consequently, the company will become a competitor to major wireless operators, such as Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Royal KPN N.V. and Belgacon.In Jun 2013, Liberty Global acquired a 100% stake in the British cable MSO, Virgin Media, which offers mobile phone services.

iberty Global has pulled back to long-term support, and buyers are stepping in.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker monitoring program detected the purchase of almost 1,700 July 50 calls for $0.20 and $0.25. There was no open interest at the strike before the trade appeared, which indicates that new positions were initiated.Calls lock in the price where a stock can be purchased, letting investors cheaply position for a rally. They can also generate significant leverage if shares move in the right direction. (See our  section.)LBTYA rose 3.25 percent to $41.64 in afternoon trading. The international cable-television stock doubled between the start of 2012 and mid-2013. It pushed to $45 early this year before pulling back to $40. It's now bouncing at that level for a second time as its 200-day moving average catches up with the shares. That could make some investors think long-term momentum remains intact.Buying those July calls prevents the investor from having to chase the stock if a rally unfolds, while also limiting the amount of capital he or she must risk versus owning the common.Total option volume was 5 times greater than average in the session, according to Heat Seeker.

"n Apr 16, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  . (  ).Except for the last quarter, Liberty Global has delivered negative earnings surprise in all the three quarters last year, with an average beat of negative 63.53%. The company reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same.In the coming years, we expect Liberty Global's revenues to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband, and telephone offering, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe and Latin America. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2013, Liberty Global had approximately 2 million  (  ) platform-based video subscribers with a quarterly net addition of 200,000 subscribers.In Jun 2013, Liberty Global completed the full acquisition of the British cable MSO, Virgin Media. The takeover places Liberty Global as the largest cable TV MSO (multi service operator) in the world. In the U.K., the merged entity poses serious competitive threat to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc and  (  ).Notably, Virgin Media decided to offer the video-subscription service of the online video streaming service provider  (  ). With this, web-based services will be integrated into the cable system for the first time in the global pay-TV industry.Additonally, the board of directors of Liberty Global decided to authorize a $4.5 billion share buy-back program over the next two years.The company is predominantly operating in Europe, which is currently the most vulnerable region economically. Ongoing debt crisis in several European countries may significantly affect the future prospects of Liberty Global. The company is gradually shifting focus to western Europe and some Latin American countries.However, recessionary pressure is most severe in these regions. A low per capita income may stall people from spending more on exorbitant high-speed bundled communication services and HD-DVR-based digital video services.Liberty Global is currently trading at significantly higher multiples with respect to several valuation metrics compared with the industry average and the S&P 500. We believe that this high level of valuation may restrict above-market gain anytime soon.Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Updated Research Report on Liberty Global - Analyst Blog@2014-04-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/updated-research-report-on-liberty-global-analyst-blog-2014-04-17

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYA) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Dollar General Corp (Symbol: DG), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Liberty Global plc (Symbol: LBTYA), the market cap is now $17.88B, versus Dollar General Corp (Symbol: DG) at $17.87B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA vs. DG:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, LBTYA and DG collectively make up 1.83% of the iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (  ) which is up by about 1% on the day Tuesday.At the closing bell, LBTYA is up about 1.3%, while DG is up about 0.5% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Liberty Global Larger Than S&P 500 Component Dollar General@2014-02-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/liberty-global-larger-sp-500-component-dollar-general-2014-02-04
 (  ), a leading cable TV operator in Europe and Latin America, is all set to fortify its foothold in the core North European markets. Yesterday, the company declared that it has reached an agreement to acquire a 100% stake in Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in the Netherlands.At present, Liberty Global holds a 28.5% stake in Ziggo. The deal is expected to close by the second half of 2014, subject to regulatory approval.Liberty Global will pay approximately $13.7 billion to acquire the remaining 71.5% stake of Ziggo including its outstanding debt. The deal will be completed through a stock and cash transaction.Per the deal, each Ziggo shareholder will receive €11.00 in cash, 0.2282 Liberty Global Class A ordinary shares and 0.5630 Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares. Based on Liberty Global's Class A share price of $83.27 and Class C share price of $78.80 as of Jan 24, 2014, the Offer translates into a price of approximately €34.53 per Ziggo ordinary share.Liberty Global already has a strong presence in the Dutch cable-TV market as its UPC Broadband Holding BV unit is the second largest cable MSO in the country.A merger between Liberty Global and Ziggo will create a dominant cable TV operator in the Netherlands with approximately 10.8 million revenue generating units. Ziggo also competes with telecom operators such as Royal KPN N.V. and  (  ).Liberty Global is trying to extensively penetrate the European region with its bundled video, voice and Internet (data) services.

Liberty Global's Latin American operations include VTR Internet and wireless businesses in Chile and its 60% share in Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico.In Jun 2013, Liberty Global acquired a 100% stake in the British cable MSO, Virgin Media.

"Shutterstock photo""Breaking Bad"" fans suffering from withdrawal since the hit television series ended in September may be able to get their fix again soon.Cable channel operatorAMC Networks (  ), which brought you this crime drama of a terminally ill chemistry teacher turned meth dealer on its namesake AMC network, debuts the spinoff ""Better Call Saul"" in November. From AMC and Sony Pictures, it tells the back story of crooked lawyer Saul Goodman before he became the attorney for dealer Walter White, the main character on ""Breaking Bad.""Known too for ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Mad Men,"" AMC Networks owns and operates several cable TV channels, including nationally distributed programming networks AMC, WE tv, IFC and the Sundance Channel. New shows, returning series and international strategies are forecast to help spur viewer interest and company growth long after the final episode of ""Breaking Bad,"" which aired in September to a series-record audience of 10.3 million.Stay tuned for more scripted programming in 2014 from the flagship AMC network.""A popular phrase in the media business is 'content is king,'"" said Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris. ""That will be the case for AMC Networks in 2104. It will be a big year in terms of them introducing new shows and expanding existing shows.""The 2014 lineup on the AMC network includes the debut of a Revolutionary War piece called ""Turn,"" and ""Halt & Catch Fire,"" which captures the rise of the PC era in the early 1980s. Both are produced by AMC Studios and will be distributed internationally through Entertainment One (eOne) Television.AMC Networks is also expanding original programming on We tv, the Sundance Channel and IFC, says Morris.This is important, he notes, because those three channels ""aren't fully distributed"" to the roughly 100 million pay-TV (cable, satellite and telco) subscribers in the U.S., while the AMC network is distributed to just about all of them.""By bolstering these three channels with more original programs, one of the company's objectives is to create that must-have stature for the networks, and in doing so increase the number of subscribers,"" he said. ""That's very high-margin revenue because there's little direct costs associated with it.""New scripted programming this year on AMC as well as program expansion at its other channels should help AMC Networks keep up the strong momentum it's been seeing of late, analysts say. Earnings have risen by at least 42% year-over-year the past three quarters and sales have increased by at least 16%. In the third quarter, they climbed 57% to 80 cents a share. Revenue shot up 19% to $395.3 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year 2014 earnings rising 69% to $3.19 a share.""The flagship AMC network generates the lion's share of the economics of the company, and it has been very successful with shows like 'The Walking Dead' -- the highest rated nonsports program on cable, 'Mad Men' and 'Breaking Bad,'"" said Morris.""These are the three most prominent programs on AMC, each of which has seen not only strong ratings, but strong ratings growth since their debuts,"" he added. ""With that ratings growth has come growth in ad revenue and direct content revenue, including sales of 'Walking Dead' toNetflix (  ).""In Q3 the AMC network led the 36% ad revenue growth seen across the company's National Networks segment, which includes AMC, IFC, We tv and Sundance, said CEO Josh Sapan on the quarter's conference call with analysts.AMC Networks enhances its growth potential further this year as it sets its sights on expanding overseas. The company agreed to buy Chellomedia, the international content division ofLiberty Global (  ), for $1.04 billion, it announced in October. The deal is set to close in the first quarter.The acquisition provides AMC Networks an array of TV channels distributed to more than 390 million households in 138 countries, the company said.""As AMC Networks has expanded internationally, we have had a great desire to do something we consider fundamentally strategic, which is to take our content and put it on channels we own,"" said Sapan in announcing the deal. ""This acquisition allows us to secure a large, global platform on which to distribute our increasingly successful original programming through a collection of strong, well-established and well-managed assets worldwide.""What does Chellomedia bring?""It jumpstarts international revenue, which is less than 10% right now,"" said Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Young. ""Fifty percent of Chello is general entertainment. So the content fits nicely with the portfolio."" It provides diversification and lets AMC Networks replicate its success abroad, she adds.In a report, Young also noted: ""Chello has a significant presence in Europe and Latin America, the latter where AMCX recently sealed a deal withDirecTV (  ) to launch Sundance. This will build on AMCX's international footprint, including Canada, Sundance in Europe and Asia as well as WE tv in Asia.""AMC Networks is also expanding overseas on its own. In September, it launched Sundance Channel for the first time in Latin America in partnership with DirecTV, the largest pay-TV distributor in the region.AMC Networks should have plenty of growth drivers in the U.S. too. Morris expects 36 hours of owned original content on AMC this year, in addition to new originals on We tv and the Sundance Channel.He cites the point that AMC Networks ""owns"" the new ""Turn"" and the ""Halt & Catch Fire"" series.""A successful owned program can be more attractive for the company because they participate fully in all of the revenue streams, such as selling the program to Netflix,"" he said.Historically, adds Morris, the company has licensed rather than owned most of its scripted programs, including some of its most popular shows such as ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Mad Men."" When program content is licensed to the company, a studio produces and owns it, he notes. With licensed programs, AMC ""participates in the ancillary revenue streams, but not to the extent"" that it does when it owns the program content, he adds.In addition to new shows, the AMC network will have a full lineup of returning series this year, including season five of ""The Walking Dead"" starting Feb. 9; the first half of the final season of ""Mad Men"" with a 90-minute premiere on April 13; and the season four premiere of the Western ""Hell on Wheels,"" to debut this summer.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@AMC Networks Tunes For TV Growth After 'Breaking Bad'@2014-01-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-networks-tunes-tv-growth-after-breaking-bad-2014-01-27

" (  ) is set to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2013 results after the opening bell on Feb 13, 2014.In the last quarter, the company delivered a negative 80.43% earnings surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Liberty Global's revenues will continue to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband and telephone, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe and Latin America. Liberty Global recently launched a hybrid IP video gateway called ""Horizon TV"" in five countries.The new web-based hybrid modem includes an open software developer platform and application store. Such value-added services will continue to drive subscriber growth for the company.On the flip side, Liberty Global's continuous acquisitions may lead to integration risks and a highly leveraged balance sheet. The company predominantly operates in Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable. Ongoing debt crisis in several European countries may significantly affect the future prospect of Liberty Global.Several European broadband service providers are gradually deploying high-speed DSL and Fiber-to-the-Home networks, making the industry extremely competitive. In addition, we expect more cash-strapped consumers to downsize existing services, resulting in subscriber loss.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Liberty Global is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are poised at 38 cents. Hence, the ESP is 0.00%.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold): Liberty Global's Zacks Rank #3 decreases the predictive power of ESP.We caution investors against the stock going into the earnings announcement, as a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.00% combined with a Zacks Rank #3 lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise for Liberty Global.Here are some other companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.

n Jan 16, we maintained our Neutral recommendation on  (  ). In the recently concluded third quarter fiscal 2013, the company missed both the top and bottom line of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Rogers was the first company in Canada to launch LTE (Long Term Evolution) network. Initially, the company deployed LTE network in 90 cities of Canada, covering over 60% of Rogers' footprint. The company also offered a variety of LTE-enabled smartphones. Further, Rogers is the first Canadian carrier to offer LTE roaming service to its subscribers traveling to Hong Kong, Switzerland and South Korea.Rogers is also the first Canadian carrier to strike a Connected Car M2M deal with Sprint to deliver navigation, entertainment, climate control, security and emergency services to its subscribers using the Sprint Velocity solution in their vehicles.Rogers also happens to be the first Canadian carrier to initiate the suretap Wallet app in collaboration with MasterCard Canada. The service is available on few NFC-based smartphones and provides secure mobile payment service. Recently, the company entered into a 12-year broadcast and multimedia agreement with National Hockey League (NHL) for national rights to NHL games on all platforms and languages.Softness in the advertising market due to the lack of investment in TV content may hurt profitability in the near future. The increased competition in the cable TV business after BCE Inc. entered the Canadian market could also add to the woes. Moreover, the Canadian regulatory authority's decision to grant licenses to four new operators in order to improve national wireless service, subsequently increasing competition in the Canadian wireless market, may further act as a headwind for Rogers.Furthermore, the company has a highly leveraged balance sheet with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.70. Hence, we believe that increased dividend payment coupled with an aggressive stock buy-back plan and deployment of 4G LTE across its footprints may further exert pressure on Rogers' cash flow, thereby widening its current debt-to-capitalization ratio.Rogers Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Other stocks to consider in the cable and media industry include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

 (  ), a leading cable TV operator in Europe and Latin America, is all set to fortify its foothold in the core North European markets. Recently, Bloomberg reported that the company is close to reaching an agreement to acquire full control of Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Netherlands. In Oct 2012, Liberty Global's first attempt to acquire Ziggo entirely was promptly rejected by the latter as the financial term was inadequate.At present, Liberty Global holds a 28.5% stake in Ziggo. The financial terms on which the two entities are currently negotiating for the remaining 71.5% stake of Ziggo are yet to be disclosed. However, several industry researchers have estimated that the company may need to pay $6.8 - $7 billion more.Liberty Global already has a strong presence in the Dutch cable-TV market through its UPC Broadband Holding BV unit, which is the second largest cable MSO in that country.Liberty Global is trying to extensively penetrate the European region with its bundled video, voice and Internet (data) services. The European markets are still relatively untapped for this unique triple-play offering. The company currently holds a 58.4% stake in the Belgian cable TV operator Telenet Group Holding NV.A merger between Liberty Global and Ziggo will create a cable TV giant in Netherlands with approximately 10.8 million revenue generating units. Ziggo also competes with telecom operators such as Royal KPN N.V. and  (  ).In Jun 2013, Liberty Global acquired a 100% stake in the British cable MSO, Virgin Media.

Liberty Global reported weak second-quarter 2014 financial results, wherein both its top and bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company is gradually establishing a strong foothold in the European cable MSO market. We believe the long-term business fundamentals of the company are very intriguing, primarily owing to strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, the acquisition of TV content producer All3Media, faster broadband and triple-play bundled offerings, strong cash flow and the growing popularity of Horizon TV services. However, stiff competition, saturated European markets, high integration risks and mounting programing expenses may act as headwinds for Liberty Global while moving ahead. Also, the stock is fairly valued at current levels. Hence, we reaffirm our long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.Denver, CO-based Liberty Global plc. (LBTYA) is the largest triple-play cable operator in the international market, providing video, voice, and Internet access in 14 countries, primarily in the European countries and Chile.

Its other subsidiary, UPC Holding, provides video, voice and broadband Internet services in 10 European countries and Chile.

e expect  (  ) - the second-largest cable MSO in the U.S. - to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2013 results before the market opens on Oct 31, 2013.Our proven model shows that Time Warner Cable is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.22%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Time Warner Cable currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that the stocks with Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Time Warner Cable's Zacks Rank #3 and +1.22% Earnings ESP makes us confident of a positive earnings beat.Continuous deployment of the DOCSIS 3.0 technology across its footprints coupled with rate hikes and launch of popular sports channels in the U.S. will drive Time Warner Cable's top-line growth, while moving ahead. Moreover, deals with different sports majors and different device launches will further act as tailwinds for the company.On the downside, customers are opting for cheaper video streaming service providers like Netflix, Hulu.Com and YouTube, causing a persistent loss of video subscribers. This remains the primary cause of concern for Time Warner Cable.Other companies you may consider on the basis of our model which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter are as follows: (  ) with Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). (  ) with Earnings ESP of +26.09% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Comcast currently covers more than 75% of its broadband footprint with IPv6 and is expected to achieve full compatibility by early 2014.At present, Comcast primarily uses wireless gateway modems of Arris Enterprises, namely, the TG852G and TG862G series products for IPv6 deployment. It was crucial for Comcast to deliver uninterrupted IP-based services as the existing IPv4 address space is quickly approaching exhaustion.IPv6 Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), Prefix Delegation and Prefix Stability are some of the major features of the IPv6 protocol stack supported by Arris' C4 CMTS platform.Comcast is expecting to enhance IPv6 traffic flow to a large extent in 2014. Currently it reaches approximately 4 million broadband subscribers.The company is also working with Cisco Systems to offer IPv6 using the vendor's uBR10000 cable modem termination system (CMTS).

 (  ) reportedly acquired 76.48% stakes in Germany's largest cable network company, Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, for €7.7 billion ($10.21 billion).We believe the multi-billion dollar acquisition would fortify Vodafone's presence in the European telecommunication market. In addition, it will strengthen its position against players with equal potential such as  (  ) and Deutsche Telekom AG in Europe's largest telecommunication market.It is evident that the prospective acquisition would oust major players in the German wireline industry. Vodafone would then be an undisputed leader in wireline business with the biggest loaf of cable TV and broadband business in Deutsch land.West Europe is experiencing growing demand for pay-TV services together with triple-play bundled services that combine basic cable TV and Internet. Telephone carriers like Vodafone are exploring markets, where they can increase share with bundled video, broadband and telephone that warrants higher margin and lower churn rates.However, beyond this, Vodafone foresees significant cost synergies (approximately 300-500 million Euros) as it will not have to pay rentals for copper lines to Deutsche Telekom. Vodafone currently requires these copper lines to provide DSL services to its 3.3 million customers in Germany.Further, Vodafone's efforts to bring its customers within one network infrastructure (DSL to LTE) through the deal would result in additional savings by curtailing expenses on network build outs.However, we believe that the implementation of network conversion remains a long-term process and involves structural changes. Hence, in the near future, we expect the Kabel Deutschland deal, which comes with an existing set of network backhauls, to provide a good platform for offloading data traffic and resolving spectrum issues for Vodafone.Vodafone, which operates in the European market with the likes of  (  ) and  (  ) currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@VOD Gets Large Kabel Deutschland Stake - Analyst Blog@2013-09-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vod-gets-large-kabel-deutschland-stake-analyst-blog-2013-09-17
 (  ) has finally confirmed that it is in talks with  (  ) for selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. Both the companies have been mulling over this deal over a long time and news surfaced early this year about Verizon planning a possible buyout.Reportedly, Verizon is contemplating a $100 billion buyout offer to Vodafone. However, given the current market value of Verizon Wireless, market sources project Vodafone may push the deal up to $130 billion in exchange of its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. According to , Verizon is also in talks with several banks for financing up to $60 billion of the deal with Vodafone. The company is expected to confirm its decision about the transaction early next month.This is not the first time that talks of a possible takeover of Verizon Wireless have emerged. Back in 2006, Verizon had proposed the same acquisition to no avail. Reportedly, Vodafone had claimed about $160 billion to settle the deal.Verizon Wireless remains a lucrative source of dividend payments for Vodafone. The proposed deal would perhaps mean an exit from one of its legacy markets, North America, and deeper focus on its growing business in emerging markets. However, we believe that with Vodofone facing troubles with its European operations and emerging markets like India and Africa at their nascent stages of development, the call to do away with its position in the U.S. could prove critical for the company.On the other hand, Vodafone is also moving ahead with its multi-billion dollar acquisition of Germany's largest cable network provider Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, which we believe requires considerable financing. To accomplish this, the Verizon stake sale could be a lucrative option for Vodafone, as it will enable Vodafone to complete the transaction without entering debts.For Verizon, the total buyout of its wireless business would mean saving a substantial amount of the payment that slips to Vodafone's pocket. However, will the deal be all that rosy for Verizon?The highlight is on Verizon's ability to carry a transaction that could be worth over a $100 billion, according to market estimates. Given the current balance sheet position of Verizon, it seems nearly impossible to gulp the whole of the deal in one go. Perhaps, buying out a certain percentage of Vodafone's share in parts may work for Verizon. As a result, the company has been reportedly looking forward to a 50:50 cash and stock offer to Vodafone.Whether the company buys the entire stake at once or in parts remains to be seen. We also have to wait for the impact that this buyout would have on the shareholders of Verizon.However, looking at the current balance sheet position of Verizon, the company will have to bank upon debt funds to carry out the transaction. This remains evident by reports of Verizon being in talks with several banks for financing its deal. In such an event, this would directly reflect on investor returns, resulting in lower payout from the current level.Therefore, it does not look very appealing for investors, whose gains from the buyout in terms of dividend that is currently being remitted to Vodafone remain unclear. Further, questions arise on whether this amount will compensate for the cost of debt borne by the company, or if it will have a neutral impact on investors of Verizon as the company may look for possible solutions to maintain its status quo in terms of dividend payouts.All these doubts and queries can only be cleared when there is a concrete decision about the buyout plan. We can only expect the decision, which is likely in the coming days, to bring some good news for the already beleaguered market.Vodafone Group, which operates with other European telecom players like  (  ) and  .

 (  ) has reportedly filed for approval to the European Commission for its Kabel Deutschland buyout. In June, Vodafone offered €7.5 billion to acquire Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Germany's largest cable network company.We believe the multi-billion dollar acquisition would fortify Vodafone's presence in the European telecommunication market. In addition, it will also strengthen its position against players with equal potential such as  (  ) and Deutsche Telekom AG in Europe's largest telecommunication market.Kabel Deutschland covers over 8 million German households. It offers wireline services like HD and analog TV, Pay TV and broadband Internet with speeds of up to 100 Mbps and fixed-line voice services through cable as well as wireless services through industry collaborations.It is evident that the prospective acquisition would oust major players in the German wireline industry. Vodafone would then be an undisputed leader in wireline business with the biggest share of cable TV and broadband business in Deutschland.West Europe is experiencing a growing demand for pay-TV services together with triple-play bundled services that combine the basic cable TV and Internet.

Hence, in the near future, we expect the likely Kabel Deutschland deal, which comes with an existing set of network backhauls, to provide a good platform for offloading data traffic and resolve spectrum issues for Vodafone.However, the biggest challenge for the company will be to win antitrust approval. Historically, this issue has impeded the successful completion of many deals such as the  (  ) and T-mobile acquisition.

" 's Third Point Offshore Fund is underperforming the market this year, having returned 15% versus the S&P 500's 16.1% return through Aug. 31. For the month of August, the fund fell 0.7%, less than the S&P's 2.9% decline. While other strategies may be lackluster at the moment, the hedge fund manager's stock picking strength is seen in his top five positions, which are all well into positive territory this year. The other strategies remain unknown as Loeb ceased reporting his top five overall positions (including shorts, currency plays and others) back in May.As of June 30, his top long stock picks having a stellar year are Yahoo Inc. (  ), American International Group (  ), Liberty Global PLC (  ) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (  ).Loeb has been highly involved Yahoo since opening the investment in the third quarter of 2011. It seemed in the first quarter of 2013 that he would begin taking profits since the price had recovered and he sold 11,000,400 shares. But in the second quarter, he sold none of his remaining 62 million shares as the price continued to climb.Since reporting his second quarter portfolio, Loeb has sold approximately two-thirds of his stake in Yahoo and retains 20 million shares. The investment as of July had an internal rate of return of approximately 50% since inception.Year to date, Yahoo shares are up almost 47% -- a level not seen since 2008 and its heyday in the preceding years.Loeb and two of his Third Point nominees also left the board of directors of Yahoo in July, as part of his settlement agreement of his proxy contest in 2012.Loeb also listed his accomplishments with the company in his second quarter letter:""Since Third Point initiated its position, over $15 billion of value has been created, growing the company's market cap from $15 billion to $30 billion today, while over $5.2 billion of cash has been returned to shareholders. Since Third Point made ""The Case for Alibaba"" in our original investment presentation, our Fourth Quarter 2011 Investor Letter, and on our valueyahoo.com shareholder advocacy website, consensus Wall Street estimates for Alibaba's value have increased from $20 billion to over $80 billion. In addition, and consistent with our views on Japan, Yahoo Japan's value has also more than doubled during this period.""Yahoo reported a 7% decline in revenue for the second quarter 2013, to $1.14 billion, compared to the previous year, but it was more profitable. GAAP net earnings increased 46% to $331 million.Its cash balance stood at $4.8 billion, compared to $6 billion at year-end 2012. Management repurchased 190 million shares, fulfilling its promise that it would return $3.65 billion from its Alibaba Group sale to shareholders. After the buyback, approximately $1.9 billion remains under its previous authorization.Yahoo has a P/E of 8.7, P/B of 2.2 and P/S of 7.02.Loeb holds 10 million shares of AIG, after reducing 13.5 million since the fourth quarter of 2012. He opened the position in the second quarter of 2012, and has an approximate gain of 52% on his average purchase price.His second largest position, it makes up 10.1% of his stock portfolio.Originally, Loeb bought into AIG at what he believed was a discount:Later, he began to view the company more as a ""post-reorg equity newly emerged, with all of the attendant upside."" Its operational turnaround would push it to intrinsic value, with the Treasury's sale of its 16% stake providing a catalyst.In the second quarter, AIG reported a net income increase to $2.7 billion from $2.3 billion a year previously. Earnings per share also increased to $1.84 from $1.12 a year previously. Each of its property casualty, life and retirement and mortgage insurance businesses reported improvements. Management decided on a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and authorized a $1 billion repurchase program.As Loeb's top stock that he has been adding to, he increased the position by 275%, or 2.2 million shares, at an average cost of $74. He owned 3 million shares at quarter's end.Loeb was incited to purchase Liberty Global, Europe's largest cable operator, in the first quarter when its price declined following the announcement of its acquisition of Virgin Media. Loeb named ""multiple catalysts and favorable geographic tailwinds"" as spurring his initial interest in the company. In April he said:He also foresaw the company generating $6 per share of free cash flow in fiscal 2014, including its buyback plan. In 2012 the company produced $3.88 per share in free cash flow, and in the trailing 12 months ended June 30, it was at $3.43 per share.The company also produced consolidated revenue of $3.16 billion, a $637 million year-over-year increase. The biggest drive of the growth was the inclusion of Virgin Media, contributing $401 million since it began attached on June 8 through the end of the period on June 30.A net loss of $12 million was a substantial drop from net earnings of $702 million the previous year, as the 2012 period included a large gain on the disposition of its interest in Austar. Excluding that gain, it would have reported a significant improvement.Loeb has been building up his newer position in Thermo Fisher Scientific since the first quarter of 2013. He owns 2.5 million shares in total. The average gain on the holding is 17%.Year to date, the company's stock has gained almost 43%.Thermo Fisher is a maker of innovative technologies under three brand names: Thermo Scientific, Fisher Scientific and Unity Lab Services. On April 15, it announced it would acquire Life Technologies Corp, to become ""the unrivaled leader in serving research, specialty diagnostics and applied markets,"" according to the statement.""Our customers in research and applied markets will now be able to achieve even higher levels of innovation and productivity by working with the combined company. We're especially excited about the new opportunities we will have to leverage our complementary offerings, fueled by a shared commitment to continuous innovation. For our shareholders, we expect the transaction to generate attractive financial returns, as well as significant and immediate accretion to our adjusted EPS,"" said Marc N. Casper, president and chief executive officer of Thermo Fisher Scientific.The deal is set to close in early 2014.In the second quarter, the company reported a 4% revenue increase to a record $3.24 billion. EPS also reached a record $1.32 after increasing 8% from $1.22 a year previously.During the quarter, the company launched three new-generation mass spectrometry platforms and opened a new China Innovation Center in Shanghai which increased its research and development capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.To see more  stock picks, see his portfolio here.

"ome of his high-profile hedge fund colleagues have experienced mixed results from their activist investments recently, but  has been on a fairly good streak with his biggest bets such as Yahoo (  ) and Herbalife (  ). This week he dove into his next project: art auction house Sotheby's (  ).Reported on Monday, Loeb purchased a 5.78% stake in the company, equaling 3,925,000 shares, according to  . The 13D filing states that he accumulated the shares in a series of purchases and sells taking place from June 26 through Aug. 23. His purchase prices ranged from $37.64 to $45.76.His hedge fund, Third Point, paid $156,716,025 in aggregate for the shares.As the ""purpose of transaction,"" the filing says:Sotheby's is a London-based company auctioning authenticated fine art, decorative art and jewelry. Year to date, Sotheby's shares have climbed almost 37%, trading for $45.96 after a 2.65% decline on Tuesday. The company has a $3.14 billion market cap.In the past five years, Sotheby's has grown revenue per share at a rate of 6.2%, and EBITDA per share at a rate of 33.6%.BID data by In the second quarter, the company's revenues were almost flat over the prior-year quarter, at $304.8 million. The quarterly commission revenue received a $19.8 million boost from an increase in the buyer's premium rate which took effect on March 15. But contracting sellers' margins weighed on results, as pressure from competition to win high-value consignments intensified.In the future, the company is looking to improvements in its digital media offerings and expansion into China and emerging markets to increase its financial results.Quarterly earnings increased 7% from the prior year, to $91.7 million, primarily due to an income tax benefit. Earnings are down 7% for the first half of the year.Last month, Loeb sold down his position in Yahoo by 201%, retaining just 20.6 million shares. He had by the third quarter of 2012 amassed a position of more than 73 million shares, after he began buying copiously in the third quarter of 2011. His activity with the company helped the price surge and has given him about a 100%, or $1 billion profit.Upon selling most of his Yahoo shares, Loeb wrote in his mid-year commentary:He also praised Yahoo's new board members and CEO, Marissa Mayer, who has headed the transformation of the company.Loeb purchased 3.1 million shares - about 8% -- of Herbalife in the fourth quarter of 2012 when it tumbled in reaction to fellow investor Bill Ackman's presentation eviscerating the company. He also offered his own counter-thesis on the company in his fourth quarter letter, refuting Ackman's three claims about the company: that it is an ""illegal pyramid scheme,"" that its customers and distributors had been exploited and harmed and that its products are sold at inflated prices.In his fourth quarter letter, he said:Loeb then closed out his Herbalife position in the first quarter when the price averaged $38.84 - up from the roughly $26 per share December low. If he had held on slightly longer, shares eventually did reach his $55 to $68 intrinsic value range.Herbalife share price:Besides Yahoo, Loeb's top holdings are AIG (  ), Liberty Global Group Inc. (  ) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (  ), up 42%, 19% and 17%, respectively, from his average purchase price.See Daniel Loeb's portfolio here.

e downgrade our recommendation on  (  ) to Underperform primarily based on its current valuation. The company posted mixed financial results for the first quarter of 2013. While the total revenue surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, net income fell below the same.The stock price of Liberty Global has soared more than 55% in the last year and is currently trading at extremely high multiples compared to both the S&P 500 and the industry average with respect to several valuation metrics. We believe that the stock is overvalued at this stage and the multiples must converge toward its peer average.Additionally, the pay-TV market of Germany is expected to become intensely competitive in the near future.  (  ), a global telecom giant, is on the verge of acquiring Kabel Deutschland, the largest pay-TV operator in Germany. Notably, Germany is the major growth region for Liberty Global. Moreover, business integration risk persists as the company has recently acquired several companies either partially or fully.Liberty Global continues to lose customers for its basic video offerings. In the fourth quarter of 2012, it lost a net total of 92,000 video customers. This was mainly due to a huge loss of video subscribers in the Romanian operations. In the reported quarter, the company added 373,000 organic revenue generating units (RGU), down 16.2% year over year.Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). While we prefer to avoid Liberty Global until we see reasonable valuation metrics, other Cable TV stocks worth a look are  (  ) and  (  ).

"At a nearly 40% premium on  (OTCMKTS:KBDHF) share price,  (  ) has agreed to buy Germany's largest cable company for 7.7 billion ($10 billion). Vodafone is the world's second largest mobile operator, behind  (  ), and it is acquiring Kable Deutschland for its TV and fixed-line services, which will give it strategic positioning in the European market. The price of the offer was increased last week after a counteroffer was made by John Malone of  (  ). Though Malone may still make another offer, sources familiar with Kabel Deutschland say this is unlikely to happen.The ""quad-play,"" as it's called -- which is the combination of TV, broadband, mobile, and fixed-line services -- has become ubiquitous in European nations like France and Spain, yet German cable companies have remained, as of yet, relatively fragmented. The Vodafone-Kabel Deutschland deal will allow Vodafone to beat its German competitors, like Unity Media and  (OTCMKTS:DTEGY), to the quad-play punch.This is Vodafone's largest acquisition in six years and its second major purchase of a European fixed-line network within the last year, after acquiring the British  (  ) in July 2012. The Galaxy Tab 3 7.0Officially announced on June 3,  (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) new line of tablets have received their release dates and prices: Available on July 7 from retailers like  (  ) and  (AMZN), the Galaxy Tabs 7.0, 8.0, and 10.1 will cost $199, $299, and $399, respectively. The model numbers refer to the size of the devices in inches; the 8-inch and 10-inch models will run Android 4.2 with more powerful processors while the 7.0 will run Android 4.1.The new Samsung tablets are cheaper than  (AAPL) similar offerings, especially on the smaller-sized end, with the 7-inch iPad mini starting at $329, the 9.5-inch iPad 2 starting at $399, and the iPad with Retina Display starting at $499.With the new tablet line joining its Tab 2 and Note lines, Samsung continues to offer a wide array of devices to meet varying consumer needs, a strategy very unlike Apple's more focused three-device approach. No single Galaxy tablet has been a major selling product, but together, the tablets have performed well. Over the last year, Samsung's tablet share has grown 283% to 17.9% of worldwide shipments.The new Galaxy Tab 3 line will be available for pre-order tomorrow, June 25.Last evening,  the  confirmed rumors that  (FB), for the past year, has been developing a news-reading product, internally referred to as ""Reader."" Though the report mentioned few details, it did state that the current version of Reader is similar to the popular news-reading app Flipboard, which currently has over 50 million users. Reader features posts from users, content providers, publishers, and advertisers to create a personalized news feed that is optimized for mobile devices.The news comes just a week before  (GOOG) is set to discontinue its own Reader app. Facebook -- along with Flipboard and similar apps like Zite, Pulse, and Google Currents -- will likely be vying for the void left on July 1.Facebook, constantly looking to recoup the value it lost after its IPO, has invested heavily in mobile. Reader will fit into that strategy, diversifying and tightening the social network's presence on phones and tablets. On the other hand, Facebook has never been fully regarded as a source of news, and the Reader may prove to be a stretch for the company.In an effort to curtail movie piracy in Asia,  (DIS) and  (SNE) have both begun releasing major theatrical films on-demand while they are still in theaters. Both studios are employing the new policy in South Korea, the world's eighth largest film market. Recent films include Sony's  which went on-demand only three weeks after its April, South Korean release, along with Disney's  and  , which went on-demand four and five weeks after their respective release dates.According to the  executives of the four other major studios have said that they are paying close attention to the efforts of Disney and Sony in South Korea. In the US, it is standard practice for top cinema chains, including  (RGC) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., to refuse to play films that don't have a guaranteed 90-day gap between theatrical release and DVD/streaming release. As Patrick Corcoran, the spokesman of the National Association of Theatre Owners has said, ""A short window or simultaneous release muddies the value proposition being offered to consumers.""Disney has experimented with early on-demand release before: In 2011, the studio released  on-demand in Portugal, six weeks into the theatrical run. Also in 2011,  (TWX).,  (CMCSA), and  (NWSA) all experimented with earlier on-demand availability, through satellite broadcaster  (DTV). However, in those cases, films were released 60 days after their American debut and at the cost of $30 per film, which is a full six times the standard on-demand price after 90 days. The results of the 60-day window experiment were widely considered unsuccessful.Though theaters and studios are worried about potential displacement, some analysts maintain that the move to earlier on-demand does not raise any need for concern. Kim Young-gi, of the Korean Film Council, has said, ""Movie-going is a cultural experience, VOD [video on-demand] is like watching TV. I expect their markets will remain separate.""Either way, Sony and Disney are still playing the movies cautiously in South Korea, while the other big four are waiting anxiously to see how the future of movie-going and viewing will develop.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Tech News: Samsung's New Tablets Cast a Wider and Cheaper Net Than Apple Inc's@2013-06-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-news-samsungs-new-tablets-cast-wider-and-cheaper-net-apple-incs-2013-06-24
.S. media giant,  (  ) has made an offer to acquire Germany's largest cable network company, Kabel Deutschland Holding AG. Liberty Global Inc. has outbid  's (  ) offer of €7.2 billion (approximately $9.6 billion) by making a counter offer of €7.5 billion (approximately $10 billion).However, Vodafone plans to make its offer more attractive after being refused by Kabel Deutschland.At present, the German television broadcast market is dominated by Kabel Deutschland and Liberty Global Inc., which has taken a number of strategic steps to strengthen its position and continue business restructuring. In this regard, the company has already acquired German cable TV aces namely, UnityMedia GmbH and Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH & Co KG.Kabel Deutschland is worth of €8 billion and covers over 8 million German households. It offers wireline services like HD and analog TV, Pay-TV and broadband Internet with speeds up to 100 Mbps and fixed-line voice services through cable as well as wireless services through industry collaborations.Hence, we believe that the acquisition of Kabel Deutschland will further strengthen Liberty Global's market position and deliver strong top-line growth.A few days back, Liberty Global also acquired the British cable MSO, Virgin Media, for a total consideration of $15.8 billion or an enterprise value of nearly $23.3 billion. The acquisition makes Liberty Global the largest cable TV MSO (multi service operator) in the world, surpassing  (  ), the largest cable MSO of the U.S. Together, Liberty Global and Virgin Media will have approximately 25 million subscribers compared with nearly 22 million subscribers of Comcast.In the U.K., the merged entity will become a formidable challenger to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc, which is the largest pay-TV operator in the U.K. and is partially controlled by  (  ).However, we remain concerned about the company's highly leveraged balance sheet. The $29.6 billion debt appearing on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of 2013, may impede the company's future acquisition plans.Currently, Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@LBTYA Eyes Kabel Deutschland - Analyst Blog@2013-06-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lbtya-eyes-kabel-deutschland-analyst-blog-2013-06-18

Scripps Networks estimated a 12-14% increase in programming costs and a 7-9% increase in marketing expenses in 2013. Compared to this, revenues are expected to rise by a mere 7-9%.Meanwhile, the stock price has soared over 31% in the last year and is currently trading at the high-end of its 52-week price range.

irgin Media, a leading cable TV operator in the U.K. and a wholly owned subsidiary of  (  ), has decided to offer the video-subscription service of the online video streaming service provider  (  ). With this, for the first time in the global pay-TV industry, web-based service will be integrated into cable system.Initially, Virgin Media will test run the Netflix service with its 40,000 subscribers who use the company's next-generation set top boxes developed by  (  ). This new converged digital TV platform provides improved graphics, on-demand video content, catch-up TV service, web-based applications including games and personal video recorder.This set-top box integrates the Internet and live TV on one screen through fiber-optic cable. At the end of the second quarter of 2013, Virgin Media had approximately 3.77 million subscribers of which nearly 44% uses TiVo set-top boxes.Virgin Media is already offering an innovative video service called TV Anywhere. This application platform enables the company's subscribers to watch up to 45 live TV channels on several devices including TVs, PCs, smartphones and tablets. This simply means that customers can view live TV shows even outside home using their mobile devices. Furthermore, using this application, subscribers can manage recorded programs and control TiVo-developed set-top boxes from a remote place.Throughout the world, pay-TV operators are facing severe threat of cord cutting by their subscribers. Moreover, nowadays, consumers prefer laptops, tablets and smartphones to TVs to watch videos.As a result online video streaming operators are gaining momentum.

 (  ) will sell its Irish subsidiary - O2 Ireland - to Hutchison Whampoa's 3 Ireland for €780 million ($1 billion). The divesture is part of the company's attempt to reduce its enormous debt burden.Per the agreement, Telefonica will receive an additional deferred payment of €70 million ($90 million) post the fulfilment of the agreed financial targets. However, Hong Kong-based Hutchison has to face regulatory hurdles as acquiring O2 Ireland will create a monopolistic situation within the Irish telecom market.O2 is the second-largest mobile phone operator in Ireland. Nevertheless, in the last couple of years, the company has lost market share to  (  ), Eircom and Hutchison's 3 mobile brand. Telefonica's O2 Ireland has received bids from Eircom Group, Hutchison's 3 and  (  ).The combination of the second and the third-largest telecom carriers in the Irish market will have an estimated market share of 37.5%. Post the acquisition, 3 Ireland will have the size and financial backup to challenge the market leader, Vodafone Ireland.Telefonica continues to struggle in Europe as declining mobile data usage and fierce competition continue to hurt the company's profitability. Additionally, Telefonica has one of the highest debt burdens within the industry with outstanding debt of approximately $68.43 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2013.The transaction is part of Telefonica's policy of disposing its non-core assets to reduce its huge debt burden. Telefonica wants to reduce its debt by approximately $6.4 billion (€5 billion) by the end of 2013.The telecom behemoth has stopped paying dividends and is planning a widespread restructuring to considerably reduce its leverage in an attempt to weather the difficult situation. The company raised $1.93 billion (€1.45 billion) by listing its German unit, Telefonica Deutschland, and has also sold its small stake in  (  ) for $1.47 billion (€1.13 billion).Recently, the Madrid-based company sold a 40% stake in its Central American operations for $500 million (€ 389 million) and is also considering the sale of its Czech Republic operations.

odafone Hutchison Australia, a unit of  (  ) recently announced the commercial launch of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) services in Australia. The company has currently deployed LTE services in key metropolitan cities, namely, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth and Sydney. Given the growing market for hi-speed data services, we believe this new venture would bring financial benefits to the company. In addition, 4G LTE services will also generate significant market traction.Apart from Australia, Vodafone is accelerating its 4G expansion in many other countires like South Africa and other European markets like Germany, Rome and Milan in Italy. The company has over 400,000 LTE customers. Ongoing efforts to upgrade the existing network infrastructure should result in higher network efficiency and increased mobile data capacity. The company is also working on spectrum acquisitions and secured spectrum licensing in the Netherlands, Ireland and India. The company also won the U.K. 4G spectrum auction in the 800MHz and 2.6GHz ranges.Vodafone group, the second largest telecom carrier following  (  ) is continuously gaining share in the majority of its markets on strong adoption of data services and migration to smartphones. The company's future growth hinges on key drivers like increasing mobile data services, growth in enterprise markets through converged fixed and mobile services (Vodafone One Net). Further, new pricing plans such as Vodafone Red, growth in emerging markets, growth in machine-to-machine, near-field communications and mobile financial services, as well as maintaining liquid investment in quality networks would also be accretive.Further, we believe the re-structuring of enterprise business into one unit, Vodafone Group Enterprise and integration of Cable & Wireless Worldwide will enhance its product portfolio and tap opportunities in large and medium-sized businesses. Consistent with the company's plan to expand its Enterprise segment, in Feb 2013, Vodafone inked a multi-year contract with BAE Systems plc, which deals in defense, aerospace and security business to supply mobile communication worldwide. The agreement remains accretive to the company's global enterprise customers while promoting its security products and services.Vodafone operates with the likes of  (  ) and  (  ) and carriers a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vodafone Launches LTE in Australia - Analyst Blog@2013-06-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vodafone-launches-lte-in-australia-analyst-blog-2013-06-14
 (  ), the second-largest wireless carrier in the world, is considering to acquire Italian fixed line operator, Fastweb S.P.A. The move is viewed as an attempt by the company to bolster its landline and internet assets.Fastweb, a unit of Swisscom AG, is Italy's third-largest retail broadband operator and is reported to have 1.9 million customers. This is the third approach by Vodafone to acquire Fastweb, as its earlier offers were rejected by Swisscom.Fastweb sells bundled TV and broadband packages in partnership with Sky Italia Srl. The company has also signed an agreement with  (  ) to develop broadband infrastructure.This is the second approach by Vodafone in quick succession to acquire a European telecom operator after it recently made an initial offering of €7.2 billion (approximately $9.6 billion) for Kabel Deutschland. Kabel Deutschland offers Pay-TV, broadband internet and fixed-line voice services through cable as well as wireless services by collaborating with the other industry players.Vodafone exited the financial year 2013 with cash and cash equivalents of £7.6 billion ($12.05billion) and free cash flow of £5.6 billion ($8.8 billion). However, the company has a high leverage position with an outstanding debt of £29.0 billion ($45.9 billion) at the end of 2013.Pricing pressure and macroeconomic uncertainty has affected Vodafone as the company reported a 16% annualized decline in revenues from Southern Europe. Declining revenues from countries like Italy and Spain majorly affected the results.Inspite of the poor performance, Vodafone is eying a number of acquisitions to strengthen its services across Europe. The company is rumoured to sale its 45% Verizon Wireless stake to the U.S. telecom giant,  (  ) for $100 billion. The proceeds might be used to fund the aforementioned purchases.We believe that the takeover of Fastweb will not only provide Vodafone access to the existing setup of Fastweb but will also fortify its position against rival,  (  ), which is currently competing with Vodafone over European assets.However, it remains to be seen whether the company goes ahead with these acquisitions if its proposed stake sale to Verizon does not materialize.Vodafone currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vodafone Eyes Italian Asset Fastweb - Analyst Blog@2013-06-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vodafone-eyes-italian-asset-fastweb-analyst-blog-2013-06-18
fter a preliminary acquisition offer last week, according to sources,  (  ) has raised its bid to €7.5 billion from €7.2 billion (approximately $9.6 billion) for Kabel Deutschland. This brings the new offer to around 85 euro cents per share from the previous bid of €0.80-€0.82.We believe that Vodafone's new offer is a strategic counter reaction to the proposed plan of  (  ) to acquire Kabel Deutschland. Recently, Liberty Global made a higher offer to Kabel Deutschland, outbidding Vodafone's initial offer.Kabel Deutschland, with a net worth of €8 billion, covers over 8 million German households. It offers wireline services like HD and analog TV, Pay TV and broadband Internet with speeds of up to 100 Mbps and fixed-line voice services through cable as well as wireless services through industry collaborations.It is evident that the prospective acquisition would oust major players in the German wireline industry. Vodafone would then be an undisputed leader in wireline business with the biggest loaf of cable TV and broadband business in Deutscheland.West Europe is experiencing a growing demand for pay-TV services together with triple-play bundled services that combine basic cable TV, and Internet. Telephone carriers like Vodafone are increasingly looking for markets, where they can increase share with bundled video, broadband, and telephone that warrant higher margin and lower churn rates.But, beyond this, Vodafone foresees significant cost synergies (approximately 300-500 million Euros) by not having to pay rentals for copper lines to Deutsche Telekom. Vodafone currently requires these copper lines to provide its 3.3 million customers in Germany with DSL services.Further, Vodafone's efforts to bring its customers within one network infrastructure (DSL to LTE) through the deal would result in additional savings for the company by curtailing spending on network build outs.However, we believe that the implementation of network conversion remains a long-term process and involves structural changes. Hence, in the near future, we expect the likely Kabel Deutschland deal, which comes with an existing set of network backhauls, to provide a good platform for offloading data traffic and resolving spectrum issues for Vodafone.However, the biggest challenge for the company will be to win antitrust approval. Historically, this issue has impeded the successful completion of many deals such as the  (  ) and T-mobile acquisition. Given the size of Vodafone's prospective deal and its impact on the competitive position of players like Liberty Global, there lies a fair chance of regulatory intervention.Vodafone, which operates in the European market with the likes of  (  ) currently carriers a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vodafone Raises Kabel Deutschland Bid - Analyst Blog@2013-06-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vodafone-raises-kabel-deutschland-bid-analyst-blog-2013-06-21

The deal is worth around $15.8 billion or an enterprise value of nearly $23.3 billion.On Jun 7, the company declared that it has finally received shareholders' approval, regulatory approvals including both the U.S. and European and completed other customary closing conditions to acquie Virgin Media.The acquisition makes Liberty Global the largest cable TV MSO (multi service operator) in the world, surpassing  (  ), the largest cable MSO of the U.S. Together, Liberty Global and Virgin Media will have approximately 25 million subscribers compared with nearly 22 million subscribers of Comcast.In the U.K., the merged entity will become a formidable challenger to British Sky Broadcasting Group plc., which is the largest pay-TV operator in the U.K. and is partially controlled by  (  ).Liberty Global is gradually establishing a strong foothold in the European cable TV market. On Apr 2013, Liberty Global acquired a 12.65% ownership of Ziggo, the largest cable MSO in the Netherlands. Ziggo also competes with telecom operators such as, Royal KPN N.V. and  (  ). Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We believe that the long-term business fundamental of the company is very intriguing, primarily due to a strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, faster broadband and triple-play bundled offerings. Acquisition of Virgin Media will enable Liberty Global to explore U.K., which is one of the most lucrative markets in Europe.In the coming years, we believe Liberty Global's revenues will continue to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe.

nding all speculations,  (  ) has finally confirmed its preliminary approach to Germany's largest cable network company, Kabel Deutschland Holding AG. We believe the multi-billion dollar acquisition would fortify Vodafone's presence in the European telecommunication market.In addition, it will also strengthen its position against players with equal potential such as  (  ) and Deutsche Telekom AG in Europe's largest telecommunication market.According to Reuters, Vodafone has a made an initial offering of €7.2 billion (approximately $9.6 billion) to Kabel Deutschland. This represents Vodafone's biggest acquisition proposal since 2007 and the second largest takeover in Europe, following Liberty Global's acquisition of UK-based cable company Virgin Media.Kabel Deutschland, with a net worth of €8 billion, covers over 8 million German households. It offers wireline services like HD and analog TV, Pay TV and broadband Internet with speed of up to 100 Mbps and fixed-line voice services through cable as well as wireless services through industry collaborations.A possible takeover of this company would provide Vodafone access to the existing setup of Kabel Deutschland and solidify its wireline business in the key European market. Kabel Deutschland reported revenues of €1,700 million and adjusted EBITDA of €795 million in its fiscal year ending Mar 31, 2012. This points towards the financial synergies that Vodafone can draw from the deal.Similar to the other international markets, the German television broadcast market is governed by highly competitive market forces. Currently, there are two major companies - Kabel Deutschland and Liberty Global Inc. - that are dominating the current market for cable TVs.These mega companies have been battling each other to foray deeper into the domestic market through mergers and acquisitions. Liberty Global Inc. remains ahead in this race with its purchase Unitymedia (the second largest cable operator of Germany) and Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH & Co KG (the third largest) - in 2010 and 2011, respectively.Given these two mega acquisitions, Liberty Global has become a formidable player in the German cable TV market. The enlarged Liberty Global manages around 7 million subscribers; close second to Kabel Deutschland GmbH.In 2012, Kabel Deutschland proposed to buy regional service provider, Tele Columbus. The buyout was however rejected by German regulators citing competitive issues.We believe the German cable TV market is already duopolistic and the takeover of Kabel Deutschland by Vodafone will lead to a true duopoly. Vodafone's competitive position will likely be benefited by the mammoth European scale of operations that this acquisition offers. Added businesses from Kabel Deutschland would undisputedly increase Vodafone's economies of scale, placing the company up and above Liberty Global.When the whole world is in a wireless frenzy and the providers are desperately seeking LTE expansion plans, it might look like an out of the league strategy for a wireless company to seek expansion in the fixed line business involving significant investments. However, given the lucrative opportunities in the European cable business, the strategy does not surprise.These markets, West Europe in particular, are experiencing growing demand for pay-TV services together with triple-play bundled services that combine basic cable TV, and Internet. Telephone carriers like Vodafone are increasingly looking for markets, where they can increase share with bundled video, broadband, and telephone that warrants higher margin and lower churn rates.It is evident that the prospective acquisition would oust major players in the German wireline industry. Vodafone would then be an undisputed leader in wireline business with the biggest loaf of cable TV and broadband business in Deutscheland.But, beyond this, Vodafone foresees significant cost synergies (approximately 300-500 million Euros) by not having to pay rentals for copper lines to Deutsche Telekom. Vodafone currently requires these copper lines to provide its 3.3 million customers in Germany with DSL services.Further, Vodafone's efforts to bring its customers within one network infrastructure (DSL to LTE) through the deal would result in additional savings for the company by curtailing spending on network build outs.However, we believe that the implementation of network conversion remains a long-term process and involves structural changes. Hence, in the near future, we expect the likely Kabel Deutschland deal, which comes with an existing set of network backhauls, to provide a good platform for offloading data traffic and resolving spectrum issues for Vodafone.The million-dollar question here is whether the Vodafone-Kabel Deutschland deal will eventually materialize.We believe the biggest challenge for the company will be to win antitrust approval. Historically, this very issue has impeded the successful completion of many deals such as the  (  ) and T-mobile acquisition. Given the size of Vodafone's prospective deal and its impact on the competitive position of other players like Liberty Global, there lies a fair chance of regulatory interventions.Vodafone, which operates in the European market with the likes of  (  ), currently carriers a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vodafone Approaches Kabel Deutschland - Analyst Blog@2013-06-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vodafone-approaches-kabel-deutschland-analyst-blog-2013-06-13

It is believed to be a strategic acquisition by the company to widen its presence in Asia.AFC is a 24/7 broadcasting channel and displays substantial amount of Asian and international video content. Scripps Networks will also benefit from AFC's increased number of original programs that are viewed by 8 million subscribers across 11 markets in Singapore.

The cross brand initiative will showcase HGTV's outdoor products on HSN's outdoor living category.Post the acquisition, Scripps Networks will have three lifestyle television brands in the key growth markets of Asia, as Food Network and Travel Channel have already been distributed in Asia.Since 2009, Scripps Networks formed several partnerships and acquisitions to expand its international presence. Notably, the acquisition of a controlling stake in the Travel Channel has lifted Scripps Networks as the  leader in lifestyle programming.

 (  ) and  (  ), the world's largest and second largest telecom carriers, announced that they have agreed to form a consortium to bid for mobile license in Myanmar. The telecom giants are aiming to secure one of the two telecom licenses to rollout a nationwide telecom network in Myanmar (Burma).Investors from all around the world are piling up to grab Myanmar's telecom license as only 10% of the country's 64 million populations has access to mobile communications. Though wireless service in Myanmar was introduced in 2001, high activation cost has kept mobile phones out of reach for most of the people.However, the government of Myanmar wishes to increase the wireless penetration to 80% by 2016, thus wants to increase the number of telecom carriers from 2 to 4. Myanmar provides a new growth opportunity for Vodafone, which has been struggling in the ongoing economic instability in Europe.Myanmar government has received expressions of interest (EOI) from 91 entities, which include bids from SingTel, Qatar Telecom and Telenor. Though tough competition awaits Vodafone and China, if successful the mobile operators will get the license to operate a nationwide network for 15 years.

The largest of the new buys are Starz (  ), Micros Systems Inc. (  ), MSCI Inc. (  ), Cooper Companies (  ) and Dollar General Corp. (  ).Below is a brief overview of the new holdings:Starz Inc. spun off of Liberty Media Corp. on Jan. 11, 2013. Manning & Napier acquired 4,893,340 shares of Starz for $18 per share on average in the first quarter.

It has 55 million subscribers as of Sept. 30, 2012.Starz in the fourth quarter reported a 2% decrease in revenue to $422 million compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to declining Starz Distribution revenue from fewer titles available from the Weinstein Company LLC, as well as not renewing an agreement with Netflix (  ). Subscriptions to Starz increased by 85% to 21.2 million, and subscriptions to Encore increased by 5% to 34.8 million.The company's net income improved to $252.3 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $236.4 million in the year-ago quarter. It had $749.8 million in cash on its balance sheet compared to $1.1 billion at year-end 2011, primarily due to a cash distribution related to the spin-off.

(  ) fell 4.0% in the third quarter due to uncertainty around how iPads could impact sales of point-of-sale (POS) terminals. We believe that MICROS Systems's proprietary hardware offers restaurant customers key advantages, including durability, extended useful life, and best-in-class support. We view iPads as a feasible solution only at the low end of the POS market. MICROS Systems's proprietary software and services are hardware-agnostic, so customers can purchase licenses regardless of the POS terminal being used.

 (  ) - the second largest cable MSO in the U.S. after  (  ) - faced service disruption when more than 88,000 home-phone subscribers failed to make or receive calls.Such service failures mainly occur due to some technical issues and the engineers from Time Warner Cable are already looking into the problem. They are confident about restoring back services shortly.Time Warner Cable reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, total revenue increased 9.9% year over year to $5,485 million. The strong performance was mainly attributed to improved advertising sales, strong high-speed data revenue growth and successful integration of Insight Communications.Time Warner Cable exited fiscal 2012 with nearly five million Residential voice subscribers. The Residential voice service contributed $527 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 with an annualized growth of nearly 6.5%.Therefore, this recent service disruption holds utmost importance for Time Warner Cable as the home-phone business contributes a significant portion to company's top line. So, any loss of voice subscribers may impact TWC's Residential Services Segment in the upcoming quarter.Currently, Time Warner Cable has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other companies belonging to the same sector are  (  ) and  (  ).

e reiterate our long-term Neutral recommendation on  (  ). The company's fourth quarter of 2012 financial results easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates.Liberty Global is gradually establishing a strong foothold in the European cable MSO market.We believe that the long-term business fundamental of the company is very intriguing, primarily due to strong demand for its digital cable-TV services, faster broadband and triple-play bundled offerings.The company is systematically conducting a share buyback program. However, business integration risk persists as Liberty Global has decided to acquire several companies either partially or fully.Moreover, Liberty Global is currently trading at significantly higher multiple with respect to several valuation metrics compared with the industry average and the S&P 500. The stock price has soared nearly 66% over the last year and is currently trading at a 52-week high end.We believe that this high level of valuation may restrict any above market gain any time soon. Liberty Global currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).On Feb 2013, Liberty Global entered into an agreement to acquire 100% stake of  (  ) in a cash and equity deal. Both the companies are expecting the deal to be completed by the second quarter of 2013, subject to customary regulatory approval. If this deal gets approved, then Liberty Global will become a formidable challenger to BSkyB, the largest pay-TV operator of the U.K. and  (  ). BSkyB is partially controlled by  (  ).On Apr 2013, Liberty Global acquired a 12.65% ownership of Ziggo, the largest cable MSO in Netherlands. At the end of 2012, Ziggo had more than 2.2 million digital TV subscribers, almost 1.8 million Internet subscribers and 1.5 million telephone subscribers. A major positive for Liberty Global is that Ziggo currently has a dividend yield of about 7.4%. Liberty Global expects Ziggo to pay about $473.5 million to investors as dividend in 2013.Nevertheless, Liberty Global is predominantly operating in Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable region. Ongoing debt crisis in several European countries may significantly affect the future prospect the company. Management is gradually concentrating on western and northen Europe.

Through a cash and equity deal, Liberty Global will acquire a 100% stake in Virgin Media.

uropean telecommunication giant  (  ) and Polish operator Polkomtel jointly announced that they have entered into a new partnership that will allow Vodafone to improve its services in Eastern Europe.The non-equity partnership agreement will be beneficial for Vodafone's multinational customers as Poland will be added to their existing contracts for international services. This will raise the company's Partner Market agreement in the region to seven countries.Vodafone's Partner Market is a program in which the company enters into a partnership with a local mobile carrier in a country, where the group doesn't have any exposure. Under the program, Vodafone cooperates with its partner to market certain products and services, which are often developed jointly.Polkomtel will benefit from collaborating with a big company like Vodafone and will be able to offer more than its competitors to its business and retail customers. Polkomtel, which operates under the brand 'Plus' in Poland, has a customer base of over 14 million.Notably, Vodafone was a minority shareholder of Polkomtel. However, in an attempt to realize the value of its non-controlled assets, the company sold its entire 24.4% stake in Polkomtel, in 2011.In the recently concluded quarter, Vodafone declared weak financial results where consolidated revenues declined 1.8%, mainly based on lower revenues from European operations.Before the deal, Vodafone had partner agreements with six different nations while they have operations in only four European countries. We believe that this is a strategic move by the company to enhance its presence in Eastern Europe, without any major investments as the company will be offering its services via the local partner's network.Vodafone currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some other stocks in the European telecommunication industry are  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

range, a subsidiary of  (  ), signed an agreement with IHS, a telecom infrastructure operator, to manage and run its 2,000 towers in the African countries of Ivory Coast and Cameroon. None of the companies have divulged financial details of the deal.Per the deal, IHS plans to operate the towers to improve the mobile infrastructure of the two African nations, for the next 15 years. Under IHS's tower-sharing model the available space on 2,000 towers will be marketed to other mobile carriers in Africa, while the Orange subsidiaries will get access to the available space of IHS in both the countries. However, the ownership of the property will remain with the two Orange subsidiaries.Pan African operator IHS, through its tower sharing model, manages around 5,000 towers and allows its partner to enhance network coverage, improve customer experience and derive cost efficiency.To further expand the network coverage, IHS plans to build new hybrid solar and generator power sites, which will reduce diesel consumption up to 70%. Solar-powered sites are extremely beneficial in rural areas due to low data traffic demand and lesser diesel consumption, which in turn reduces tower operating costs.According to Orange, sharing its infrastructure with a tower specialist is favorable for the company as it will be able to handle situations like volatile energy costs or land accessibility, better than its partner.We believe that outsourcing tower infrastructure will not only save Orange's operating cost, but will also help the French giant to gain from the technical know-how of IHS.Currently, France Telecom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy).Other stocks to consider among foreign telecom companies are  (  ),  (CHA ) and  (  ).

The channel provides home enthusiasts with high-quality products and home transformational videos that will allow them to enhance home exterior.HGTV reported a healthy financial report where revenues jumped 5.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. However, declining viewership remains a major concern for HGTV which accounts for a reduced advertising revenue of SNI.With spring round the corner, more number of people is expected to resort to gardening, enhancing the audience base of the channel.

e reiterate our long-term Neutral recommendation on  (  ) as we believe the stock is currently fairly valued. The company posted strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates.DIRECTV continues to enjoy huge net subscriber addition in both the U.S. and Latin America, growing average revenue per user in the U.S. and higher operating margin and operating profit before depreciation and amortization. The company is trying to establish itself as a premier pay-TV operator targeting high-quality subscribers. Management is confident that it will be able to achieve its financial goals for 2013 easily.However, macroeconomic fluctuations, huge programming costs and growing competitive threats may restrict the company's upside potential. Already, the rate of subscriber addition in the U.S. has moderated due to a stricter credit standard and reduced promotional discounts. DIRECTV currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).DIRECTV has improved its subscriber quality - shrinking the proportion of subscribers with low credit ratings - by restructuring dealer incentives (changed the commission and penalty structure), cutting the proportion of third-party dealer sales, and implementing a credit card policy for new subscribers.Both DIRECTV and its closest rival  (  ) are gradually transforming their respective business models from being a low-priced operator to a premium service provider.Meanwhile, DIRECTV is trying hard to acquire Vivendi SA's subsidiary unit Global Village Telecom (GVT) - a Brazilian telecom carrier. GVT offers voice, broadband and pay-TV services in Brazil. At present, DIRECTV is Brazil's No. 2 pay-TV service provider.If successful, the company will generate substantial synergies from the acquisition by offering bundled voice, broadband, and high quality pay-TV services in Brazil. Apart from DIRECTV, other major bidders for GVT are  (  ),  (  ) and a private equity group.Nevertheless, a major near-term headwind for DIRECTV is the recent currency devaluation in Venezuela. The government of Venezuela has devalued its currency Bolivar by 32%. This was Bolivar's fifth devaluation in a decade. Venezuela contributes approximately 3.5% of the total revenue of DIRECTV.The company has already declared that it will incur a one-time pre-tax charge of $160 million in 2013 related to the devaluation of Bolivar. This will negatively impact DIRECTV's Latin American revenue, net earnings and cash flow growth.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@DIRECTV Remains Neutral - Analyst Blog@2013-03-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/directv-remains-neutral-analyst-blog-2013-03-08

In addition to cost savings, the solution also addresses the security concern of the enterprise clients.The cloud-based services business has been growing for quite some time, as it significantly reduces the operational cost of enterprises by providing secure and affordable data management solutions, thereby enhancing business productivity.France Telecom reported weak financial results for the fourth quarter of 2012. The company earned €10.92 billion ($14.16 billion), marking a year-over-year drop of 3.2%. Enterprise segment also has a weak quarter, where revenue slid by 2.7% to €1.79 billion ($2.32 billion).France Telecom is enhancing its service portfolio to tap the recent rise in demand among enterprise customers to use cloud-based service. We believe this will allow France Telecom to offset its falling wireless business and strengthen its enterprise segment revenue.

 (  ), a leading cable operator in Europe and Latin America is set to further consolidate its foothold in the core North European markets. Yesterday, the company announced that it has acquired 12.65% ownership of Ziggo N.V., the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in Netherlands.Liberty Global has acquired 25.3 million common outstanding shares of Ziggo from Barclays Capital Securities Ltd. for a total consideration of Euro 632.5 million (around $809.4 million).Liberty Global already has a strong presence in the Dutch cable-TV market through its UPC Broadband Holding BV unit, which is the second largest cable MSO in that country. Liberty Global is trying to extensively penetrate the European region with its bundled video, voice and Internet (data) services. The European markets are still relatively untapped for this unique triple-play offering.At the end of 2012, Ziggo had more than 2.2 million digital TV subscribers, almost 1.8 million Internet subscribers and 1.5 million telephone subscribers. Ziggo also competes with telecom operators such as, Royal KPN N.V. and  (  ). A major positive for Liberty Global is that Ziggo currently has a dividend yield of about 7.4%. Liberty Global expects Ziggo to pay Euro 370 (approximately $473.5 million) to investors as dividend.From early 2010, Liberty Global is continuing its business restructuring. The company is concentrating primarily on Europe and Latin America and divested operations in other parts of the world.On Feb 5, 2013, Liberty Global came out with a joint press statement with  (  ), that the two companies have entered into an agreement in which Liberty Global will acquire a 100% stake in Virgin Media in a cash and equity deal.

he British  (  ) is reportedly considering a buyout of Spain's smallest mobile operator Yoigo, which is majority owned by Sweden's TeliaSonera. Although there is no an official acknowledgment of this deal, yet the move would confirm that Vodafone is mulling every option to consolidate its operations via M&As.According to media reports Vodafone is preparing to take over Germany's largest cable network company, Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, which will strengthen its wireline business in Europe's largest telecommunication market. A potential deal could also consolidate its competitive position against equal potential players like  (  ) and Deutsche Telekom AG.Vodafone, which is the world's largest revenue generating wireless communications operator, will have to spend around $989 million to $1.32 billion (Euro 750 million to Euro 1.2 billion) to complete the acquisition. If successful Vodafone will hold around 3.5 million customers of Yoigo spread across Spain. However, the company can face counter bids from other big telecom players like  (  ) and Orange of  (  ).Last year TeliaSonera put up the Spanish mobile phone carrier for sale. Several big telecom giants, including Vodafone showed interest in acquiring Yoigo, but it was eventually scrapped after bids fell short of TeliaSonera's target of $1.32 billion (Euro 1 billion).Notably, Spain has been subject to sluggish economic recovery after the country was hit hard by sovereign debt crisis in 2011. The recent report from Spanish telecom regulator CMT shows that the country has lost 2.7 million connections alone. Except Yoigo, all the big three telecom carriers have lost customers. If Vodafone manages to acquire Yoigo, the Spanish telco will have to forgo its 3G license as Vodafone already possesses a 3G license of its own.In the recently concluded quarter Vodafone declared weak financial results with declining revenue of 2% year over year. Europe remained the major concern for the company where it lost 1.5 million customers. Within Europe Spain was one of the worst performing countries reporting a 11.3% decline in service revenue.

Currently, Virgin Media offers entertainment and communication services to the retail and enterprise customers.Currently, higher adaptations of Internet service are restricting users from downloading large multimedia files and videos quickly. Streaming services resolve this issue as they display the images before the completion of the entire download. Internet users find it easier to view movies or live games via streaming, thus affecting the market share of cable MSOs.In an attempt to take advantage of the current boom in the streaming service industry, Virgin Media wants to come up with its own streaming option. Virgin Media wants to add as much content as they can on the streaming platform to popularize the service among its customers. Offering this service will put the company in direct competition with low-cost streaming companies like  (  ),  (  ) and Hulu.Last month, Liberty Global agreed to acquire Virgin Media for a total consideration of around $16 billion. The deal, once completed, will produce cost synergies of $180 million for Liberty Global, apart from helping the company to establish a strong foothold in the BSkyB dominated U.K. cable market.BSkyB has 10.7 million subscribers, compared with Virgin Media's 4.9 million. Successful integration of Virgin Media with Liberty Global will create a dominant force in the highly lucrative U.K. pay-TV market and will allow it to compete better with streaming companies. We believe this is a strategic move by Virgin Media to retain its customers, who are switching to streaming companies to negate their high cable bills.On the downside, however, providing streaming service from its own portfolio could dampen the future prospect of Virgin Media's own cable business. As customers will be able to watch their favorite shows via streaming, they could eventually switch to a lower monthly cable plan, thus impacting the company's topline.Currently, Virgin Media carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Virgin Media to Offer Net Streaming - Analyst Blog@2013-03-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/virgin-media-to-offer-net-streaming-analyst-blog-2013-03-06

 (  ) is reportedly contemplating a buyout of Germany's largest cable network company, Kabel Deutschland Holding AG. Although there is no an official acknowledgment of this deal, it certainly brings Vodafone in the league of M&As taking place in the global telecom space.Vodafone Group is the world's largest revenue generating wireless communications operator and the second largest carrier after China Mobile Limited , based on subscription. The prospective multi-billion dollar acquisition would not only foster its presence in the European telecommunication market, but also consolidate its competitive position against equal potential players like  (  ) and  (  ) in Europe's largest telecommunication market.Kabel Deutschland, with a net worth of €8 billion , covers 8 million German households. It offers wireline services like HD and analog TV, Pay TV and broadband Internet with speed up to 100 Mbps and fixed-line voice services through cable as well as wireless services through industry collaborations.A possible takeover of this company would provide Vodafone an access to the existing setup of Kabel Deutschland and solidify its wireline business in the key European market. According to business reports, in the fiscal year ending Mar 31, 2012, Kabel Deutschland reported revenues of €1,700 million and an adjusted EBITDA of €795 million, which hints the financial synergies Vodafone can draw from the deal.Similar to the other international markets, the German telecom market is governed by highly competitive market forces. Currently, there are three major companies - Kabel Deutschland, Deutsche Telekom and Liberty Global Inc. - which are dominating the fixed line segment.These mega companies have been battling each other to penetrate deeper into the domestic market through mergers and acquisitions. Liberty Global Inc. remains ahead in this race with its purchase of Germany's two leading cable providers - Unitymedia and Kabel BW - in 2010 and 2011, respectively. In 2012, Kabel Deutschland proposed to buy regional service provider, Tele Columbus. The buyout was however rejected by the German regulators citing competitive issues.According to Reuters, while Deutsche Telekom enjoys a hefty position in the broadband market with 40% share, Liberty Global and Kabel Deutschland together enjoy 13% market share and continue to win customers through competitive offerings.When the whole world is going wireless frenzy and seeking LTE expansion plans, it might look like an out of the league strategy for a wireless company to seek expansions in the fixed line business involving significant investments. But, for Vodafone this acquisition marks an important move besides improving its market position.It is evident that the prospective acquisition would oust major players in the German wireline industry. Vodafone would then be an undisputed leader in wireline business with a big loaf of cable TV and broadband business in Deutsche land. But, beyond this, Vodafone foresees significant cost synergies (approximately €300-€500 million ) by not having to pay rentals for copper lines to Deutsche Telekom. Vodafone needs these copper lines to provide its 3.3 million customers in Germany with DSL services.Further, Vodafone efforts to bring its customers within one network infrastructure (DSL to LTE) through the deal would result in additional saving for the company by curtailing spending on network build outs. According to Vodafone's latest interim financial results, the company has already covered about 53% of its subscription under LTE coverage, out of which nearly 283,000 customers are through fixed line substitution.However, we believe implementation of network conversion remains a long term process and involves structural changes. Hence, in the near future we expect the Kabel Deutschland deal, which comes with an existing set of network backhauls, to provide a good platform for offloading data traffic and resolving spectrum issues for Vodafone.We believe there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip before the deal gets realized. The biggest challenge for the company will be to win antitrust approval. Historically, this very issue has stained the successful completion of many deals such as  (  ) and T mobile acquisition. Given the size of Vodafone's prospective deal and its impact on the competitive position of other players, there lies fair chance of regulatory interventions.Vodafone currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vodafone Eyes Kabel Deutschland - Analyst Blog@2013-02-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vodafone-eyes-kabel-deutschland-analyst-blog-2013-02-21
uropean mobile communication giant  (  ) recently tied up with Orange, an affiliate of  (  ), to roll out fiber broadband services in Spain. This partnership is also open for third-party participation.The partners have jointly agreed to invest nearly €1 billion or $1.3 billion for the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network program. With the launch scheduled in Jan 2014, the services are expected to cover 800,000 premises by Mar and reach 3 million homes in Sep 2015. The long-term goal of the operators is to bring 6 million households and workplaces across 50 major cities under its coverage by Sep 2017, representing residential market capture of about 40%.The collaboration permits Orange and the Spanish arm of Vodafone to spread their respective street-level fiber as well as in-building fiber across the nation. Interestingly, each company will have access to each other's broadband lines that will be laid out based on the same technical specifications. This will enable the total infrastructure to function as a single network.This alliance displays the companies' endeavor to render high-speed unified communications services to the Southern Europe region as fiber-optic cable transmits broadband signals faster than conventional Internet connections via telephone lines. Hence, customers will experience better and quicker internet accessibility while watching movies or playing games.Through this initiative, Vodafone is working toward fortifying its foothold in Spain - the fourth-largest economy in Euro zone - where it had been losing customers steadily over the last few years, primarily due to recession and subsequently, less spending power in the hands of the people.However, the broadband scenario of the country looks encouraging with the number of subscribers rising in the past few months. Additionally, the territory promises significant growth potential with respect to fiber deployment with comparatively less coverage versus other European countries.Independently both Orange and Vodafone were finding it difficult to compete with the wide-spread fibre optic network of Spanish behemoth  (  ). But, for the successful implementation of the newly formed agreement, Orange and Vodafone will have to seek help from Telefonica's connections. The companies plan to approach higher telecom regulatory authority in the absence of cooperating actions from Telefonica.This billion dollar venture is expected not only to consolidate the pedestals of Vodafone and Orange in the telecommunication sector of Europe but also sharpen their competitive edge over other players such as  .

edia conglomerate  (  ) continues to dominate the European pay-TV market with constant acquisitions of major cable MSOs across the region. Its latest addition will be UK's leading cable MSO  (  ) for a total consideration of nearly $16 billion or $23.3 billion of enterprise value.Liberty Global is expected to make a payment of $47.02 for every Virgin Media share based on its Feb 4 closing price. The company is expected to receive the payment in both cash and class A and class B shares.Per the agreement, the company will pay each Virgin Media shareholder (totaling 335 million) $17.50 in cash, 0.2582 Liberty Global Series A shares (totaling 86 million) and 0.1928 Liberty Global Series C shares (totaling 65 million).Both Series A and Series C shares of Liberty Global closed at $69.46 and $64.50, respectively on February Feb 4, 2013. The deal is expected to close by the end of the second half of fiscal 2013, subject to shareholders and other regulatory approvals.At the end of its recently concluded quarter, Liberty Global has nearly $4.2 billion in cash and marketable securities and $26.5 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet. However, the company requires $5.9 billion in order to make cash payments to Virgin Media shareholders. So the required amount will be financed through a combination of debt financing and available liquidity of both Liberty Global and Virgin Media.The deal, once materialized, will produce cost synergies of $180 million for Liberty Global apart from helping the company to establish a strong foothold in the BSkyB dominated UK market.BSkyB, which is partially owned by  (  ), has 10.7 million subscribers, compared with Virgin Media's 4.9 million. The successful integration of Virgin Media will create a dominant force in the highly lucrative UK pay-TV market. Moreover, the roll out of Liberty Global's Horizon TV and Virgin Media's popular  's (  ) next-generation TV platform will drive subscriber growth going forward.The UK telecom market is extremely competitive with low barriers to entry. Since its inception, Virgin Media incurred annual losses till 2010. Precipitous losses may create severe problems for the company going forward.The UK government raised the value added tax (VAT) in January 2011. Virgin Media may not be able to pass the full amount of the increased VAT to its customers as it may affect the company's ARPU in the near term.Moreover, weaker cash position of nearly $173 million and huge debt of more than $9 billion (with debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.92) followed with network upgrade program initiated by the company may affect the company's future growth prospects going forward.Hence, the only option left with Virgin Media to counter such bottlenecks is to merge with Liberty Global where both will be in a win-win position.Currently, Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@LBTYA Acquiring Virgin Media - Analyst Blog@2013-02-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lbtya-acquiring-virgin-media-analyst-blog-2013-02-06

" leading cable operator in Europe, Latin America and Australia,  (  ) plans to bid for UK's leading pay-TV service provider  (  ) in the upcoming days as reported by the Financial Times.The UK telecom market is extremely competitive with low barriers to entry. Since its inception, Virgin Media incurred annual losses until till 2010. Precipitous losses may create severe problems for the company going forward. The UK government raised the value added tax (VAT) in January 2011. Virgin Media may not be able to pass the full amount of the increased VAT to its customers as it may affect the company's ARPU in the near term.Liberty Global initiated its business restructuring process back in 2010. The company is currently concentrating primarily in Europe and Latin America while divesting operations in other parts of the world. Germany is one of the major growth areas for Liberty Global, where it has completed two major acquisitions. The company acquired UnityMedia GmbH and Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH & Co KG, the second and the third largest cable TV companies in Germany, respectively.Few days back, Liberty Global also raised its stake in its integrated telecom Belgian subsidiary, Telenet to 58.4% from its existing 50.2% stake.Western Europehas emerged as a lucrative market for the cable operators. These markets are witnessing growing demand for pay-TV services together with triple-play bundled services, which combine basic cable TV, Internet, and telephony. In the coming years, we believe Liberty Global's revenue will continue to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe.Moreover, deployment of high-speed DOCSIS 3.0 network has facilitated the company to narrow the gap between two hugely dominated UK's pay-TV markets Virgin Media and  (  ).Furthermore, Liberty Global has recently launched a hybrid IP video gateway called ""Horizon TV"" in the Netherlands. This innovative IP gateway will combine the cable operator's video services with web-based content through an integrated cable modem. Horizon runs on  's (  ) Atom CE processor.However, we remain concerned about the company's highly leveraged balance sheet. With more than $26 billion debt appearing on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of 2012, may act as a bottle neck for its future acquisition purpose.Currently, Liberty Global has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Liberty Global Eyes Virgin Media - Analyst Blog@2013-02-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/liberty-global-eyes-virgin-media-analyst-blog-2013-02-05

The report also showed a slight slow-down in new order growth.Home prices rose for a 10th consecutive month on a year-over-year basis in December, marking the biggest gain since May 2006, according to CoreLogic. The Data analysis firm's home price index rose 0.4% from the previous month and is up 8.3% compared to December 2011 levels.Earlier this morning, the International Council of Shopping Centers-Goldman Store Sales index showed a surprise 2.4% rise for the week ended Feb. 2 over the prior week, much better than the 1% decline industry experts were expecting. The weekly measure of same-store sales at the major retail chains also reported a 2.6% year-over-year increase in same-store sales, accounting for about 10% of total retail sales around the country.Overseas today, Masaaki Shirakawa, Japan's central bank governor, said he will resign his post three weeks before his five-year term expires on April 8 so his departure will coincide with those of his top deputies on March 19. Shirakawa and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have appeared at odds in recent months, but Shirakawa insisted his decision had nothing to do with Abe's call the central bank more aggressively ease monetary policy to help spur economic growth.Commodities were mostly higher, with crude oil for March delivery was up 47 cents to settle at $96.64 per barrel.

 (  ) is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2013 results on Feb 5, 2013. Last quarter, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Disney continues to deploy capital toward enhancing its portfolio of globally recognized brands and remains focused on generating increased income from affiliate deals and retransmission renewals to drive long-term growth.Disney's Cable Networks, Consumer Products, and Parks and Resorts businesses are performing well, enabling the company to post strong results. Going ahead, Disney remains well positioned to drive growth through its strategic initiatives.However, Disney listed a number of challenges which will negatively impact its financials in the upcoming quarter, including an increase of $170 million in domestic sports right costs, difficult home video comparison, higher tax rate (2% higher than the prior-year quarter) and the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Moreover, the company's capital spending is likely to put pressure on margins in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Disney is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 76 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 77 cents. This comes to a difference of -1.30%. Disney with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), enhances the possibility of an earnings surprise. However, the Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We also caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is experiencing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies from the sector you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"e reiterate our long-term Neutral recommendation on  (  ) although it missed both the top and bottom lines of the Zacks Consensus Estimates.Strong demand for its digital cable TV service, faster broadband, and triple-play bundled offerings coupled with strong foothold in the European cable MSO market and massive share repurchase plan of $1 billion will together continue to act as tailwinds for the company going forward.Liberty Global has recently launched a hybrid IP video gateway called ""Horizon TV"" in the Netherlands, where customers can share TV shows in multiple devices. Horizon TV also features an in-build application store for YouTube, Wikipedia and Facebook. This service will be extended in Switzerland, Germany and Ireland within the next 3-6 months. Such an innovative product launch coupled with the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake of its MGM Latin America venture and the remaining 49% stake of its MGM Central Europe venture will continue to drive profitability while moving ahead.However, soft European economy coupled with business integration risk arising from several acquisitions made may act as headwinds for the company in the future.Moreover, Liberty Global continues to lose customers for its basic video offerings. In the third quarter of 2012, it lost a net total of 90,000 video customers. This was mainly due to huge video subscribers' loss in the Romanian operations. Several European broadband service providers are gradually deploying high-speed DSL and Fiber-to-the-Home networks, making the industry extremely competitive.In addition, we expect more cash-squeezed consumers to downsize the existing services and churn off the subscriber base. Furthermore, the stock of Liberty Global is currently trading at a 52-week high.Liberty Global is predominantly operating in Europe, which at present is economically the most vulnerable region. The company is gradually concentrating in western Europe.However, we also prefer Liberty Global's close rival  (  ) and  (  ) as both these companies are gaining strong foothold in the European market. Both these companies are Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stocks.Currently, BT Group has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term (Hold) rating on the stock while Virgin Media has a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a short-term (Buy) rating on the stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Liberty Global in Neutral Lane - Analyst Blog@2013-01-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/liberty-global-in-neutral-lane-analyst-blog-2013-01-07
he Belgian cable TV operator Telenet Group Holding NV has decided to return 950 million Euros (approximately $1.3 billion) to its investors.

At present, Liberty Global has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Last month, Liberty Global increased its stake in its Belgian subsidiary, Telenet to 58.4% from its existing 50.2% stake. In September 2012, Liberty Global decided to acquire the remaining 50% stake in Telenet for approximately $2.6 billion.Accordingly, in December 2012, the company launched a cash offer for Telenet's shares and securities through its subsidiary Binan Investments B.V.

n an attempt to enhance shareholder return,  (  ), one of the largest triple play cable operators in the international market, has declared the authorization of a share repurchase program worth $1 billion. The company intends to spend the proceeds in different periods of 2013.At the end of the third quarter of 2012, Liberty Global had $4,294.5 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. However, the company had $26,461.5 million of outstanding debt, which translates into higher interest payments, thereby reducing the bottom line and earnings per share. The share repurchase activity will not only fuel the company's earnings per share but will also boost its share price.Under the new $1-billion share buyback plan, the Englewood, Colorado-based company plans to buy back its different class of shares, which includes Series A, Series C or a combination of both type during 2013.The stock repurchase program may be done through open market transaction or through privately-negotiated deals, which may include derivative transactions. Nevertheless, the share buyback timing will depend on market condition.During 2012, Liberty Global repurchased shares worth $925 million, bringing the total amount of share brought to $9 billion since the commencement of the program in 2005. This reflects the company's consistent effort to boost the return to its shareholders.Though the company has declared weak third-quarter 2012 financial results, its losses narrowed considerably compared to prior-year quarter. Moreover, deployment of high-speed DOCSIS 3.0 network has facilitated the company to compete with  (  ) and  (  ), and has also led to an increase in revenue.

n an effort to increase their presence in Brazilian markets, cable Multi Service Operators (MSO) like  (  ),  (  ) and telecom giant  (  ) are all eyeing for Vivendi SA's subsidiary unit Global Village Telecom (GVT) - a Brazilian telecom carrier.These companies along with another private equity firm have already proposed for an initial bid of over €6 billion ($7.76 billion). Vivendi will review all the proposals and will take the final call on early January, next year.We believe that the proceeds from the spin-off of Global Village Telecom's asset will benefit Vivendi to reduce its debt.GVT operates in 136 cities in Brazil and offers fixed telephone, broadband and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIp) service to both business and normal customers. Hence, the acquisition of GVT by these MSO's will not only gain market traction but will also help these companies to counter stiff competition that exist in the emerging Brazilian markets.In the last nine months, GVT's newly launched pay-TV service has gained 312,000 subscribers and also dominates 15.2% of Brazilian pay-TV market share.So, DIRECTV, which is one of the leading satellite TV service providers in Brazil is considering GVT as a threat, which we believe may have led them to bid for the company.Similarly, America Movil is rapidly expanding its pay-TV service across the Latin American countries with the acquisition of Pay-TV firm Net Servicos - the largest multi-service cable company in Latin America. Brazilian market happens to be one of the profitable markets for the company after Mexico.Last year, America Movil acquired StarOne S.A. (a satellite services provider in Brazil). So, further acquisition of GVT's business will not only consolidate its pay-TV business in the Brazilian market but will also help them to gain GVT's 8.178 million fixed line subscribers.We are currently maintaining our long-term Neutral recommendation on DirecTV, Liberty Global and America Movil.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Cable MSO's Eyeing for GVT Assets - Analyst Blog@2012-11-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cable-msos-eyeing-for-gvt-assets-analyst-blog-2012-11-29

" leading cable operator in Europe, Latin America and Australia,  (  ), which currently holds a 50.2% stake in Telenet, announced its intention to bid for KPN's subsidiary BASE, a leading telecom carrier in Belgium.Earlier, Mexican telecom company,  (  ) offered €2.6 billion to buy 28% shares of KPN. Deteriorating profits, persisting economic crisis in the European region has forced KPN to entertain takeover bids.In the recent past, Liberty Global has pursued a few major acquisitions, which resulted in some financial constraints for the company. So the company's plan to join forces with other private equity owners to attain the much-needed financial flexibility.Through its indirect controlling ownership interest in Telenet (50.2%), Liberty Global provides TV, phone and broadband communications services in Belgium. However, the company lacks proper mobile network and has to pay Belgian rival Mobistar to offer mobile services.So, the acquisition of KPN-owned BASE will not only help them to overcome this problem but also enable access to 4.4 million subscribers of BASE.Liberty Global initiated its business restructuring process back in 2010. The company is currently concentrating primarily in Europe and Latin America while divesting operations in other parts of the world. Germany is one of the major growth areas for Liberty Global where it has completed two major acquisitions. Liberty Global acquired UnityMedia GmbH and Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH & Co KG, the second and third largest cable TV companies in Germany, respectively.Western Europehas emerged as a lucrative market for cable operators. These markets are witnessing growing demand for pay-TV services together with triple-play bundled services that combines basic cable TV, Internet, and telephony.

"nvestors of a certain age -- myself included -- will always remember the name Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management. He was one of the pioneers of the hedge-fund industry, and he built a cult-like following after turning $8 million in seed money in 1980 into more than $20 billion by the late 1990s. Robertson eventually retired and turned over the reins to the next generation. Among this group, one protégé stands out: Charles ""Chase"" Payson Coleman III.If you don't know about him, then you should. He's steadily amassed a fortune -- and huge profits for investors -- by gaining early stakes in up-and-coming technology companies. That positioning enabled his firm, Tiger Global, to rack up a 21% annualized gain during the past decade. In fact, his fund was up a hefty 45% in 2011, making it the best-performing  in the country.To be sure, Coleman's ability to buy companies before they go public helps him to generate returns the rest of us can only dream about. Yet, in recent months, he's been much more focused on publicly-traded stocks, building clear and concentrated positions in the technology and consumer space. He's also been an active seller of stocks that he says may be less relevant in this changing  .Tiger Global  its second-quarter  regulatory filing, so let's take a closer look in what Coleman is interested. Coleman has historically held stakes in traditional media companies, but that's no longer the case. In the second quarter, he closed out long-held positions in  ,  , wireless firm  and ticket vendor  . These companies all generate significant  , though Coleman presumably questions their relevance in the changing media landscape.Coleman reinvested those proceeds into new or existing positions that collectively point to a clear theme. These include:• An expanded position in European and South American broadband provider  , which shows that he's not necessarily as dismissive of traditional media as he is of U.S.-based media assets.• A new position in  where he picked up 1.9 million  at an average price of $29.60. The fact that shares now trade for just more than $21 shows a bit of bad timing, but Coleman is a clear believer in this controversial stock's  .• He also added to his position in  , and now holds 1.4 million shares. That works out to be a $900 million stake, which isn't pocket change no matter how big your fund is.• Coleman has been building a position in  . His current stake of 1.48 million shares is worth roughly $200 million. He also has a 2.4 million share stake in Chinese security software firm  . Lastly, he has been building a position in Chinese education firm  .Coleman's recent Facebook purchase wasn't the only case of bad timing. He also added roughly 80,000 shares to an existing 780,000 share stake in  at an average price of $689 a share. Shares went on to plunge in subsequent weeks, though  , they look poised to rebound back above $700 as investors look past the near-term weakness in European travel.And though he made no changes in the second quarter, Coleman still holds a $600 million stake in Russian search engine firm  . (  ) Although it remains stuck in the low $20s, by making this his second-largest holding behind Apple, Coleman is obviously a true believer.Risks to Consider:  It's notable that this top-performing manager is shedding exposure to old-line media companies such as Viacom while making ever-larger bets on newer technology firms, here in the United States as well as in  like China and Russia. Those markets are often considered speculative and risky, but Coleman clearly believes they  the most robust long-term potential.-- David Sterman[Note: Warren Buffett, Goldman Sachs, John Kerry... maybe even YOUR own Congressman already own many of these stocks.

 's (  ) proposed disinvestment of Austar United Communications Ltd. to Foxtel is further delayed. The Australian regulatory authority, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), was all set to deliver its verdict on the proposed merger on November 30, 2011. Surprisingly, the acquirer Foxtel asked for some more time to ACCC so that the company can strengthen its arguments. Earlier, in October 2011, the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) extended the review of the proposed takeover of Austar by Foxtel for another 3 months. The FIRB is waiting for ACCC to take a firm decision on the proposed merger.In July 2011, Liberty Global decided to divest its operations in Australia. Austar, in which Liberty Global holds 54% stake, entered into a definitive agreement with Foxtel, to sell 100% stake for approximately $2 billion. Liberty Global will get around $1.08 billion. Foxtel is jointly held by Australian telecom giant Telstra, News Ltd., a division of  (  ), and Consolidated Media Holdings.All these three shareholders agreed upon the deal.However, several industry sources predicted that the Australian regulatory authority initially showed its reluctance to clear the deal since it may create a monopoly. Foxtel is the largest pay-TV operator in Australia and Austar is also a leading pay-TV operator. However, both Foxtel and Austar argued that the pay-TV operators in Australia are now facing increasing competition from free-to-air TV stations and online entertainment service providers. ACCC is yet to announce a new date for its decision.The proposed disinvestment of Austar indicates that Liberty Global will concentrate solely on Europe and some parts of Latin America. From early 2010, Liberty Global is gradually concentrating on strengthening its foothold in Europe through a series of mergers and acquisitions. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Austar Sale-off Delayed Further - Analyst Blog@2011-11-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/austar-sale-off-delayed-further-analyst-blog-2011-11-29
 (  ), a leading global cable TV and diversified broadband services provider, recently acquired Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH & Co KG, the third largest cable operator in Germany. After taking a long-time to make up its mind, German antitrust authority (Cartel Office) has finally taken a decision in favor of Liberty Global. In March 2011, the company won the auction and purchased Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg for approximately $4.2 billion. Earlier, in January 2010, Liberty Global acquired UnityMedia GmbH, the second largest cable operator of Germany.However, in June 2011, the European Union regulators decided to refer the case to the Cartel Office for properly investigating the possible harmful effects of the deal. Earlier, the German antitrust authority has described the merger of large cable operators to be detrimental to the competition in the national cable TV market. It believes that the merger of large cable operators may keep rivals out of the market for providing free-TV services to the housing associations. The housing associations of Germany negotiates contracts collectively with tenants and these contracts are generally long term (for e.g. 5 years) in nature. Furthermore, the TV channels, who develops contents, may have to pay more to air for their respective programs over the cable networks.In an interesting decision, the Cartel Office announced that it has granted the acquisition proposal due to far reaching consequences. Liberty Global remains committed to allow its competitors to bid for long-term contracts with residential property companies while discarding other contractual rights including the basic encryption of digital free TV channels. The Cartel Office thinks these concessions will offest the negative effects of the consolidation of cable TV market in Germany.Germany is the fastest growing economy in Europe and its cable TV market is highly lucrative. Currently, Liberty Global is a formidable player in this market offering triple play video, voice and Internet services. The enlarged Liberty Global will manage around 7 million subscribers coming second to Kabel Deutschland GmbH, which manages approximately 12 million subscribers. However, with respect to both revenue and profit, Liberty Global may outpace Kabel Deutschland with an annual revenue run rate of about $2.1 billion.Deployment of high-speed DOCSIS 3.0 network has helped Liberty Global to differentiate its offerings in the industry. With DOCSIS 3.0, the company can now offer speed compared with other large European cable operators, such as  (  ) and  (  ). Management has decided to deploy EuroDOCSIS 3.0 in the range of 80%-90% of all UPC broadband divisions in Western, Central, and Eastern Europe. The company is also conducting DOCSIS 3.0 trial runs in Belgium. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Liberty Global Bags Kabel BW - Analyst Blog@2011-12-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/liberty-global-bags-kabel-bw-analyst-blog-2011-12-19
iberty Global has been unstoppable for the last two years, and one investor is looking for more upside.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker tracking system detected a surge of activity in the January 50 calls and the January 55 calls, which priced for $1.80, and $0.70 respectively. Volume was below open interest in the 50s and a transaction was canceled in the 55s so there are a few different potential interpretations, but all of them are bullish.One is that the lower strike was bought and the higher strike was sold. That would have been a bullish call spread, with a net cost of $1.10 and the potential to earn a maximum profit of 355 percent if LBTYA closes at or above $55 on expiration.Another possibility is that a long position in the 50s were sold and 55s were bought, which would have been a call roll. That trade would have resulted in a credit of $1.10.A third explanation is that the investor owns shares in the global broadband company and had sold the 50s as part of a covered call and rolled the position to the higher strike. That would let them collect an addition $5 of upside on the stock in return for paying $1.10 now.LBTYA fell 1.44 percent to $42.99 in early afternoon trading, and is still below that key $50 level where the trades start to make money. It has more than quadrupled since the market bottomed in March 2009, and is approaching its previous all-time high of $45 established in July 2007.Overall option volume in the name is 133 times greater than average so far today. The call trade accounted for all the activity aside from 2 puts, so the sentiment is clearly bullish.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@How one large bull is playing Liberty Global@2011-03-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-one-large-bull-playing-liberty-global-2011-03-07
s Liberty Global going higher or lower? Not much of either, if one big investor is right.optionMONSTER's tracking systems detected the sale of 10,000 October 27.50 puts for $0.70 and a matching number of October 32.50 calls for $0.35, resulting in a total credit of $1.05. There was no open interest in either strike before the transaction priced. LBTYA fell 0.61 percent to $29.53 yesterday. The provider of voice, video, and Internet services in foreign countries is up 12 percent in the last month but is now stalling at the same $30 level where it peaked in April. It was also where the stock was valued in September 2008, immediately before panic swept the financial system.Given the long-term importance of this price area on the chart, traders may expect LBTYA to move sideways for an extended period before continuing higher. Yesterday's option trade, a short strangle, is designed to earn income from the shares doing precisely that.The investor will make the most money if the stock stays between $27.50 and $32.50 through expiration. However, thanks to the premium already earned, they're protected all the way down the $26.45 and up to $33.55. (See our Education section)The trade came one day after the company reported second-quarter results that appeared to be slightly worse than analysts had predicted. The strangle pushed total options volume in LBTYA to 8 times greater than average.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Liberty Global faces range-bound trade@2010-08-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/liberty-global-faces-range-bound-trade-2010-08-06
iberty Global is running, and one trader is loosening up the reins.optionMONSTER's tracking systems detected the purchase of 7,000 October 32.50 calls for $1.05 against existing open interest. At the same time, a new block of 7,000 January 34 calls was sold for $1.20. The trade was probably the work of an investor who owns the shares, and it can profit in two ways. First, the trader gets to keep the $0.15 difference between the two premiums.Secondly, the investor will receive an additional $1.50 on the shares if LBTYA closes at or above $34 on Jan. 21. In return for the additional money, the trader must assume the risk of owning the stock for three months longer.LBTYA rose 3.02 percent to $33.48 on Friday and is up 13 percent in the last month. The provider of Internet service in Europe, Japan, and Chile has been climbing on strong subscriber growth rates as international stocks regain favor among investors.The gains have come despite revenue missing forecasts the last time it reported results on Aug. 3 and its loss coming in wider than expected.Total options volume in LBTYA was 24 times greater than average in Friday's session.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Trade loosens reins on Liberty Global@2010-10-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-loosens-reins-liberty-global-2010-10-18
" (  ), a leading cable operator in Europe, Latin America, and Australia, may finally quit from Australia. The company's proposed disinvestment of Austar United Communications Ltd. to Foxtel get Australian regulatory approval, at last. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) clears the merger after Foxtel agrees to give up its exclusive rights for Nickelodeon and National Geographic Channel.In July 2011, Liberty Global decided to divest its operations in Australia. Austar, in which Liberty Global holds 54% stake, entered into a definitive agreement with Foxtel, to sell 100% stake for approximately $2 billion. Liberty Global will get around $1.08 billion. Foxtel is jointly held by Australian telecom giant Telstra, News Ltd., a division of  (  ), and Consolidated Media Holdings.All these three shareholders agreed upon the deal.The Australian regulatory authority initially showed its reluctance to clear the deal since it may create a monopoly. Foxtel is the largest pay-TV operator in Australia and Austar is also a leading pay-TV operator. However, both Foxtel and Austar argued that the pay-TV operators in Australia are now facing increasing competition from free-to-air TV stations and online entertainment service providers.The disinvestment of Austar indicates that Liberty Global will concentrate solely on Europe and some parts of Latin America. From early 2010, Liberty Global is gradually concentrating on strengthening its foothold in Europe through a series of mergers and acquisitions.In the coming years, we believe Liberty Global's revenue will continue to benefit from a 'triple play' of video, broadband, and telephone, as it signs up more ""bundled"" customers in Europe and Latin America. The triple play customer base increased 38.1% year over year in 2011.The company is also concentrating on its double play product, Internet and telephony, which has the potential to expand. Double play customer base penetration increased 10.3% in 2011. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Liberty Global to Quit Australia - Analyst Blog@2012-04-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/liberty-global-to-quit-australia-analyst-blog-2012-04-11
