Our strategy is to create amazing games and content, powered by services,
delivered to a large, global audience. We believe that the breadth and depth of
our portfolio, live services offerings, and our use of multiple business models
and distribution channels provide us with strategic advantages. These advantages
include the opportunity to engage an increasing number of players across more
distribution channels and geographies, and dependable sources of revenue from
our annualized sports franchises (e.g., FIFA, Madden NFL), our console, PC and
mobile catalog titles (i.e., titles that did not launch in the current fiscal
year), and our live services.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f05%2f20%2f0000712515-20-000019.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
