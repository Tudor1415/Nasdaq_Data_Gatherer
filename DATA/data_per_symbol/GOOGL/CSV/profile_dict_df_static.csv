is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one."" That
unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history --
inspiring us to do things like tackling deep computer science problems, such as
our investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.
Alphabet is a collection of businesses -- the largest of which is Google. We
report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Our Other Bets
include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google
business. We take a long term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with
the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Each of our
businesses are designed to prosper through strong leaders and independence.
Access and technology for everyone
The Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, capable of
propelling new ideas and people forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f04%2f0001652044-20-000008.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
