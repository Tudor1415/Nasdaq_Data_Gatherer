(\"Freshpet\" or the \"Company\") is disrupting the over $30.0\r\nbillion North American pet food industry by driving consumers to reassess\r\nconventional dog and cat food offerings that have remained essentially unchanged\r\nfor decades. We position our brand to benefit from mainstream trends of growing\r\npet humanization and consumer focus on health and wellness. We price our\r\nproducts to be accessible to the average consumer, providing us with broad\r\ndemographic appeal and allowing us to penetrate multiple classes of retail,\r\nincluding grocery (including online), mass, club, pet specialty and natural. We\r\nhave successfully expanded our network of Freshpet Fridges within leading\r\nblue-chip retail chains. The strength of our business model extends to our\r\ncustomers, who we believe find that Freshpet grows their pet category sales,\r\ndrives higher traffic, increases shopper frequency and delivers category leading\r\nmargins.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f25%2f0001564590-20-006185.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Gerardo Perez-Camargo", "title": "Head-Research & Development"}, {"name": "Richard A.
