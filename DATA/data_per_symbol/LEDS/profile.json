After the subsequent addition of a copper alloy\r\nlayer and finally the removal of the sapphire substrate, we further process this\r\nmultiple\u00adlayered material to create individual vertical LED chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f11%2f20%2f0001564590-19-043920.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Christopher Lee", "title": "Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & CAO"}, {"name": "Trung Tri Doan", "title": "Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer"}], "Number_of_employees": ["NO INFO"], "Subsidiaries": ["NO INFO"]}
