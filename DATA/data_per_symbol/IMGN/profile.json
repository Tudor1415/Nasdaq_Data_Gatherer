By generating targeted therapies with enhanced anti-tumor activity and\r\nfavorable tolerability profiles, we aim to disrupt the progression of cancer and\r\noffer patients more good days. We call this our commitment to ``target a better\r\nnow.''\r\n\r\nAn ADC with our proprietary technology comprises an antibody that binds to a\r\ntarget found on tumor cells and is conjugated to one of our potent anti-cancer\r\nagents as a ``payload'' to kill the tumor cell once the ADC has bound to its\r\ntarget. ADCs are an expanding approach to the treatment of cancer, with seven\r\napproved products and the number of agents in development growing significantly\r\nin recent years.\r\n\r\nWe have established a leadership position in ADCs with a portfolio of\r\ndifferentiated product candidates to address both solid tumors and hematological\r\nmalignancies.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f11%2f0001558370-20-002399.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Anna Berkenblit", "title": "Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President"}, {"name": "Mark J.
