Our goal\r\nis to develop molecules that drive significant advances in the control over or\r\ncure of immune-driven disease. To do this, we draw on our strong analytic\r\nheritage to interrogate immune biology to identify and validate high-priority\r\ntargets. We then use our protein design expertise to refine the structure of our\r\nbiological product candidates to optimize their potency and pharmacokinetics,\r\nwhile minimizing potential toxicities.\r\nThere are approximately 45 rare autoimmune disorders driven by autoantibodies,\r\nand we estimate there are one to two million patients in the United States with\r\nthese rare disorders. We are developing therapeutics for autoimmune diseases\r\nwith a focus on these diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f27%2f0001235010-20-000003.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Anthony M.
