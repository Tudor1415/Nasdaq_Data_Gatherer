"Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) has been named as the ''Top Dividend Stock of the Nasdaq 100'', according to , which published its most recent ''DividendRank'' report.   The report noted that among the components of the Nasdaq 100 index, PAYX shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics.  The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Paychex Inc, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.


The report stated, ''Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation.  That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.''

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index tracks the hundred largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq.  The exclusion of financials sets the index apart, as does the inclusion of companies that are not US-based (the Dow Jones Industrial Average for instance only covers companies based in the United States).

The current annualized dividend paid by Paychex Inc is $2.48/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend has an upcoming ex-date of 05/14/2020.  Below is a long-term dividend history chart for PAYX, which the report stressed as being of key importance.  Indeed, studying a company's past  can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Paychex Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $58.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $84.00.  The standard deviation is $7.682.


But the whole reason to look at the average PAYX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with PAYX crossing above that average target price of $70.27/share, investors in PAYX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $70.27 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Paychex Inc:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: MGK), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $160.50 per unit.


With MGK trading at a recent price near $145.63 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.21% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of MGK's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (Symbol: AMTD), NIKE Inc (Symbol: NKE), and Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX). Although AMTD has traded at a recent price of $34.23/share, the average analyst target is 17.60% higher at $40.25/share. Similarly, NKE has 16.45% upside from the recent share price of $86.02 if the average analyst target price of $100.17/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting PAYX to reach a target price of $70.36/share, which is 13.65% above the recent price of $61.91. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of AMTD, NKE, and PAYX:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 5/14/20, AGCO Corp. (Symbol: AGCO), Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX), and Raytheon Technologies Corp (Symbol: RTX) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.  AGCO Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.16 on 6/15/20, Paychex Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.62 on 5/28/20, and Raytheon Technologies Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.475 on 6/18/20.  

As a percentage of AGCO's recent stock price of $50.74, this dividend works out to approximately 0.32%, so look for shares of AGCO Corp. to trade 0.32% lower — all else being equal — when AGCO shares open for trading on 5/14/20.  Similarly, investors should look for PAYX to open 0.94% lower in price and for RTX to open 0.82% lower, all else being equal.





Below are dividend history charts for AGCO, PAYX, and RTX, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.

AGCO Corp. (Symbol: AGCO):
   Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX):Raytheon Technologies Corp (Symbol: RTX):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.26% for AGCO Corp., 3.74% for Paychex Inc, and 3.26% for Raytheon Technologies Corp.  



		

In Tuesday trading, AGCO Corp. shares are currently up about 0.7%, Paychex Inc shares are off about 0.1%, and Raytheon Technologies Corp shares are up about 1.5% on the day.

"(RTTNews) - While reporting financial results for the third quarter on Wednesday, payroll and HR services provider Paychex Inc. (PAYX) slashed its earnings and revenue growth guidance for the full year 2020.For fiscal 2020, the company now projects net income and earnings per share to grow about 7 percent and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to grow about 6 percent on total revenue growth between 8 and 9 percent.Previously, the company expected net income and earnings per share to grow in the range of 9 to 10 percent and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to grow about 0 percent on total revenue growth between 10 and 11 percent.On average, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report earnings of $3.08 per share on revenue growth of 9.5 percent to $4.13 billion for the year. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.The company's outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2020 incorporates known and some estimated impacts related to the COVID-19 virus, including the most recent reductions in the Federal Funds rate.""Results for the third quarter largely predate the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. We are taking actions to maintain the safety of our employees and mitigate the impacts of this disruption on our clients,"" said Martin Mucci, President and CEO.

"Investors in Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 15th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PAYX options chain for the new May 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $55.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PAYX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.11/share today.

Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.17% return on the cash commitment, or 60.83% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of PAYX stock at the current price level of $61.11/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.31% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PAYX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.50 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.04% boost of extra return to the investor, or 52.41% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 76%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 68%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.11) to be 42%.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2020 , Good morning. My name is Melissa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Paychex's Third Quarter . [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2020, you can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days and this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.I will start today's call with an overview of how we are responding to COVID-19, and then review business highlights for the third quarter, and Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, including our current thinking and the potential impacts of COVID-19 and our business, and then we'll open it up for your questions.First and foremost, I want to address the evolving situation we are currently facing with COVID-19. Our number one priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and serving our clients and their employees. Our business continuity plan was implemented, and our teams are working around the clock to ensure that we take the necessary steps to ensure our employee's safety while continuing to support our clients through this unprecedented time.Early on, we instituted travel restrictions and began to reduce the number of employees working in our offices. At this time all employees, unless designated as critical onsite person, now that's less than 5%, are now working from home, and our service metrics and client response time has been excellent. In fact, our average answer performance yesterday was seven seconds. Extremely proud of this team and the work they've done in a very fast period of time.I'm incredibly proud of how the whole leadership team and employees have responded to this situation. Because of their hard work and efforts, we've been able to complete all of these transitions without any service disruptions. We continue to help our clients navigate the significant amount of information and changing regulations from state and federal governments, including the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.Our compliance team also remains in contact with federal, state and local government authorities on a real time basis, to ensure we are aware of and offering support and ideas on any new regulations or support initiatives related to COVID-19 that could impact our clients.So far, we've seen minimal changes in our key metrics. However, with the expanding shutdowns of businesses throughout the nation, we do expect that this will be particularly challenging time for small and mid-sized businesses. This will have impact on our results, and Efrain will provide some color when he discusses our current outlook.The federal government has taken a number of steps to stabilize these issues and is considering more relief actions as we speak. I'm sure you're all aware of the at least Handshake Agreement last night and we're working through those detailed changes as we see how the vote and the presidential approval goes probably today.Small businesses in particular are in need of aid to be able to stay in business and pay their employees. The speed in which relief actions are put in place will impact the severity of the economic impacts resulting from this virus.Last weekend, we were part of a small group that sent a letter to Congress, supporting the Small Business Loan program to help businesses continue to pay their employees, and offered our assistance as a payroll processor to do that in the most effective and timely way. We continue to monitor leading indicators to gauge the changes in the small business environment.We believe we are well prepared to navigate our way through these uncertain times. The significant investments we've made in our technology, and in particular our mobile app, and our expanded product and features in our service model options, allow us to support our clients in any environment. And as you are well aware, we maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position.We will continue to focus on our business objectives and invest in our people and our clients. This is a rapidly evolving situation, but we will keep you informed on the expected impacts as events continue to unfold.Now, I will update you on our business and financial results for the third quarter, which reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 7% for the quarter. Management Solutions revenue grew 6% and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues grew 10%.Through the third quarter, we have continued to see strong execution in operations with record high net promoter scores and client retention. In addition, we have had strong results in our virtual sales divisions, digital marketing efforts and mid-market sales through the selling season.As we have discussed on previous calls this fiscal year, we had a slower start than anticipated on the integration of Oasis. We believe we have addressed these issues and sales. We are now fully staffed and have a new leadership team in place. For service, staffing levels are stabilized and the focus can now -- continues to be on servicing our clients with less need to work on integration of the clients into the platform. The business has strong fundamentals that will drive growth over the long-term. And we remain very positive about the continued strong demand for HR and Insurance support and PEO services, particularly in this difficult environment.As the largest 401(k) record keeper in the U.S., Paychex was prepared to respond to the SECURE Act, which was enacted in December of 2019. This legislation provides incentives for employers to offer retirement savings plans and provisions to improve savings for millions of Americans. With our strong expertise in retirement plans and our award-winning retirement services participant portal, we are well positioned to assist small and mid-sized businesses and their employees as they navigate this new legislation and plan for retirement.We launched Pay-on-Demand in December, which improves the employee experience by offering them flexible access to wages they have already earned before payday, helping them manage their personal cash flow. This is a valuable tool for employers to help attract and retain talent. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique in that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts. We also believe that Pay-on-Demand will see increased usage in this current environment with employers needing a more flexible workforce that will need much more flexible pay options and probably more immediate pay.We were excited to launch the first of our wearable apps as well, which we demonstrated in October at HR Tech Paychex Time for the Apple Watch was launched in January for Flex customers. This allows clients' employees the flexibility and convenience of punching in and out on the Apple Watch. We also launched Paychex Flex Help Center, which provides dozens of training resources and how to tutorials for assistance using Flex technology from within the application itself.Help center allows customers to access help materials that are relevant and easy to consume via their individual preferred learning method whether that is video tutorial, step-by-step instructions or chat. The latest product releases included significant enhancements to existing features, which continue to add value by making things simple for our clients and allowing users flexibility and choice. These enhancements include electronic signature capabilities in our document management tool, improved visibility into labor cost and employee data with live reports and additional integrations with some of the top HR, finance, time and attendance and benefit solutions in our Paychex integrations solution.While the -- while Flex, Paychex Flex does provide a full suite of HR solutions, the open platform allows customers the flexibility they may need to integrate with other tools if they so choose or if they already have them and don't want to switch out of them. Products like learning management services with online training, electronic signature capabilities of document management will support the needs of clients in this time of remote workforces. Our real-time payments offering was introduced -- will be introduced in April. We believe we are one of the first to offer this capability to customers and this will allow employers to pay employees faster, which can help attract talent, can also help quickly resolve any issues with payroll.Our technology roadmap continues to focus on the area of emerging technologies such as wearables, real-time payments, product integration options, data analytics and AI, all of which will play an important role in helping clients in this current environment. We are proud that Paychex's commitment to technology innovation has been recognized by industry experts. Our Flex -- our Paychex Flex Assistant was selected as a Stevie Award Winner for best use of technology in customer service. Flex Assistant answers over 250 questions, covering the breadth and depth of the Paychex payroll and HR suite. What differentiates our technologies that it seamlessly connects to a live specialist in real-time if the user wants more assistance and the entire live transaction is visible to that specialists, so no repetition is needed. Both Paychex and sure payroll also received Stevie Awards for our excellent customer service.As a critical business partner for many of our clients, we pride ourselves on doing business with integrity. It is ingrained in our corporate culture and very evident in the last few weeks as we quickly implemented our business continuity plans for our clients and employees. I'm extremely proud that Paychex is once again been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the 2020 World's Most Ethical Companies, the 12 time we received this recognition.And in summary, as we navigate these unprecedented times, we continue to support our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. We have invested heavily in making our technology solutions and service flexible and mobile and we are more prepared than ever to handle this current environment.I would like to thank our IT, sales, service, compliance, marketing and HR teams who have worked diligently to ensure regular communication to our employees and our clients, and that all employees have the equipment they need to work remotely and stay connected with each other and our clients. Also, thank you to our employees who have maintained diligence and flexibility during these transitions in the way we all work.I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? -- Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events such involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures in our earnings release. In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share. Again refer to the press release.Before I start, I hope that as we speak, you all are safe and in good health. That's the most important thing at times like this. If you have loved ones who are affected by the virus and its impacts, please accept our thoughts and prayers for you and for your family. Being human at this time is the most important thing we can do.So now let's talk finance. I'll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow-up with some greater detail in certain areas. I'll wrap with the review of fiscal 2020 outlook and some high level commentary on fiscal 2021. Yes, some high level commentary on fiscal 2021, stay tuned, based on preliminary looks into next fiscal year. Total revenue, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Oasis contributed about 1% to this growth, expenses increased 5% to the third quarter to $673 million. Increases in compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs contributed the total expense growth, partially driven by the acquisition of Oasis.Op income increased 10% to $470 million. Op margin was 41.1% for the third quarter compared to 40.1% for the third quarter of fiscal year '19. EBITDA increased 8% to $520 million. EBITDA margin was 45.6% compared to 45% for the same period last year, very strong results. Other expense net for the quarter of $6 million includes interest expense related to long-term borrowings.Our effective income tax was 23.6% for the third quarter compared to 23.7% for the same period last year. Net income and adjusted net income for the third quarter both increased 9% to $355 million and $351 million respectively. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share each increased 9% to 98% -- $0.98, sorry, per share and $0.97 per share respectively. We received approximately $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the third quarter, which is included for GAAP, but excluded in our adjusted diluted EPS.Let me provide some additional color in selected areas. Service revenue increased 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $850 million. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 10% to $272 million. So you saw, through the third quarter continued strong performance on Management Solutions. This was primarily driven by increases in our client base across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client, revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization, increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly retirement services, time and attendance in HR outsourcing.PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue growth of 10% was driven by the growth in clients across our PEO businesses, Insurance Solutions revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset as we've been saying all year by the impact of softness in workers' compensation premiums. Interest on interest on funds held for clients decreased 7% for the third quarter, primarily as a result of lower interest rates earned, partially offset by higher average interest investment balances, I should say, and realized gains. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our client base offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances. These results, obviously, do not include the impact of two March rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high quality credit securities. Long term portfolios have an average yield of 2.1%, and average duration of 3.1 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.8% for the third quarter, down from 2% last year.Now, year-to-date. Total revenue increased 12% to $3.1 billion. Service revenue increased 12% with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $2.3 billion, and PEO and Insurance Solutions reflecting growth of 36% to $763 million.Oasis contributed approximately 28% to the growth. Interest on funds held for clients grew 6% to $62 million. Operating income increased 10% to $1.2 billion. Net income and diluted earnings per share, each increased 9% to $877 million and $2.43 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 8% to $863 million and $2.39 per share, respectively.Let me talk about our financial position, which I think is really, really important in a time like this. It remains obviously very, very strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $930 million as of February 29, 2020.Funds held for clients as of February 29, 2020 was $4.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter.Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $84 million as of February 29, 2020 compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. And as interest rates oscillate, that number changes very, very significantly.Total stockholders' equity was $2.8 billion as of February 29, reflecting $667 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months. Our return on equity in the past 12 months was a very robust 42%.Cash flows from operations were $1.1 billion for the first nine months, an increase of 3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income offset by timing fluctuations in working capital.Let me just summarize our financial position, because it's very, as I said, important. We are very solid with -- our cash position is strong. We have $900 million in cash. We have an undrawn revolver. We have the highest cash generation of our peer group. We have the highest dividend and we have confidence that we will weather the storm for both our clients, our employees and our shareholders.Now, I turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. Firstly, I want to provide context. As you know, there are new events unfolding daily and we are constantly incorporating this information. Our guidance reflects our assumptions as of today, based on the information that we have regarding the potential effects on the business. This guidance also reflects the impact of 150 basis points of interest rate cuts that have occurred in March.Our guidance for the full year fiscal 2020, as you saw in the press release now, is that we anticipate Management Solutions to grow approximately 4%, PEO now about 24% for the full year, interest on funds held for clients is anticipated now to decline in the range of 2% to 3%, and total revenue is now anticipated to grow in the range of 8% to 9%.Op income as a percent of total revenue is anticipated to be approximately 36%. EBITDA margin for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%. Other expense, net, is expected to be in the range of $22 million to $24 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%.Net income, diluted earnings-per-share growth are now anticipated to increase approximately 7%, and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to grow approximately 6%.For the fourth quarter, as you can do it when you plug in your models, you can see that the guidance implies we are anticipating that total revenue will decrease modestly, and operating margins will be approximately 32%.We monitor a variety of leading internal business indicators to drive this estimate. Let me just provide some thought on that, and then I'm going to talk about next year.So, we look at leading indicators. And as I'm sitting here, I have a 42-page document from our data and analytics group that tells me a lot of stuff about what's going on in the business, not everything. Can't forecast all of the future, but we see what's happening in real time. We, through the middle of March, we're not seeing significant impacts. Martin mentioned earlier that we were monitoring key metrics, didn't really seeing significant drops. And then, toward the last -- the second half of March, we started to see the impacts on the business roll through.We've incorporated as much of that into the guidance in the fourth quarter. As we can, we think we have a reasonably good handle on what's going on. But you also temper that with experience of both what happened in 9/11, because that was an endogenous shock that was more short-lived, and then you also balance that against the '08, '09 recession. So, all of those ideas are part of the information we're triangulating to get not only the fourth quarter, but to the year that -- the next year, which I'll talk about in a second.It is for many of you, as you know, it's as though we are on the LA Expressway, on our way to the beaches, and you know there is -- the traffic is flowing smoothly, but you know there is a stop ahead. What you don't know is, those of us who've been caught there, whether it's a two-hour stop, a three-hour stop or something longer. And so, we know a stop is coming. We expect that impacts will be felt in April, in May for the remainder of this year. We've estimated them as best we can, but circumstances can change, especially as more states decide to go on full lock down.So, with that analogy and with the caveats that I just -- I'm about to mention, let me talk about next year. We typically give at least a preview of where we expect next year to be, and we won't bail out and say it's too early to say anything. We know some things and we'll tell you what we know.We will give guidance during our fiscal 2020 and the fourth quarter call in June. So, our intent is to provide you with guidance that's more complete then. But let me tell you about our thought process based on everything that we're monitoring. And again, we're early on in the process and subject to change. By the way, shout-out to Accenture. They went first. They said what they could, and obviously circumstances have changed. I am certain that when others report later, circumstances will have changed. They'll be in possession of better information, but this is what we have at this point and we'll share it with you.So, based on the leading indicators that we have, and then based on modeling on the impacts to the business and other business contractions on a very preliminary basis, our thought process is that total revenue is going to be flattish to down low-single digits for fiscal 2021. This scenario, remember, includes the impact of the most recent cuts to interest rates. And so, that will impact total revenue growth next year. We're anticipating at this point that that impact will be somewhere in the range of about $20 million off of where we end this year. That part, we have some understanding up, but obviously if the Fed decides to go negative, we'll have a conversation to that -- about that.Looking very preliminary, we would anticipate that operating margins will be somewhere in the range of about 35%. We would obviously manage the business to that and our tax rate before discrete items will remain consistent with fiscal year '20. I just can't emphasize enough that this is preliminary subject to change. At this point, the scenario that we see unfolding is significant impact in Q1, followed by some improvement in Q2, moderate improvement through Q3 and then more of the recovery in Q4 that is consistent with the shock that we saw when we went through 9/11. We continue to update our information every day literally, and I wanted to give you at least an understanding of how our thought process is going at this point.So with that, I will turn it back to Marty. One thing I would say is we want, we -- I get a lot of questions at the end, why don't you guys just stop taking questions at certain point? We will not do that. We'll answer every single question you've got. The only issue I would ask is that you keep them brief and focused. If someone asked the question before, unless you need clarification on it, please, please don't repeat the question, so everyone can have a chance to to talk before our voices give out.So with that, I'll turn it back to Marty. -- Great. Thank you. Melissa, if you could now open the call to questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. -- A question and for taking a stab at guidance in a really difficult environment. I appreciate that. I wonder if you could go into a little bit more detail in terms of the expense levers and the different levers you have in your business to sort of manage, to protect the bottom line in adverse scenarios. What do you have that you can kind of dial that you have -- that you can crank to kind of get ready to get to? -- Yeah. So you know like most service businesses, 65% of your costs are people costs and 35% are variable. We obviously will go right after as much variable costs as we can and then we'll look at where there are other opportunities. I think that's the order in which we'll do it. -- Yeah. I think with the changes, when you look back to the financial crisis of '08 and '09, we were very quick to react there and yet keep full employment of the people that we had given some of the turnover that we have and so forth. I think we have a pretty flexible ability to keep a focus on the margins, as we always have, as Efrain said. We've always led by far the industry in margins and we certainly keep a close eye on that. -- Okay. And my second one is on the PEO and Insurance segment in the quarter. Can you parse out what growth would have been there without the Oasis stub? And then just more broadly, in the insurance part of your business, can you talk about sort of risk management strategies in the context of the environment we're in and I'll hop back in the queue after that? -- Okay. So I'm going to ask you to repeat the second question to clarify what you're asking. But because I think the way you asked it, I can answer it in a variety of different ways. But if you look at PEO and Insurance -- I'm sorry, the PEO business we would have grown about mid-single-digits, I'd say in the PEO business in the third quarter. The second question I didn't get. I didn't understand. -- It was just basically in terms of the insurance part of the business. Maybe I'll rephrase the question and just sort of ask it as, how do you see that business sort of -- have you seen preliminary signs in that business of any type of deterioration in terms of leading indicators? And how do you go about managing risk in that side of the business throughout a downturn? Maybe I'll leave it to you to answer it as you would. -- Yeah, yeah. Let me just explain why I'm pausing. So PEO and Insurance, I've mentioned this to many of you, is both the brokered insurance business, which is roughly, call it, 18% to 20% of revenues in that category in the PEO business. So that causes sometimes confusion when people look at it. On the brokered business, we bear no risk. So the short answer to your question, which I don't think is what you're asking is that it really doesn't have much of an impact.The softness in the insurance, I keep calling out, is really the softness in the workers' comp insurance portion of the brokered business, not in the PEO. I think what you're asking is, if I understand the question is, how are we monitoring the at-risk portion of the insurance in the PEO? I think that's the issue. -- That's correct. -- Yeah, OK. So the short answer to that is that it's predominantly in the State of Florida, that's one. So number two, we look at medical loss ratios and they have been running very favorable. And the third, which requires a much more understanding of the way we operate the PEO, we don't anticipate that we will make insurance -- make a profit on the insurance portion of the at-risk, particularly health insurance. What that means is that, we are very cautious and very conservative in the amount of reserves that we provide.So the short answer to your question is that we have stress tested that population, which again is primarily in the State of Florida within -- by the way, just if you want to know, the average age of that population of worksite employees is about 38. What would happen if the medical loss ratio increased by 10%, which would be significant. We are still in good shape from a reserve standpoint.So the short answer is, we're constantly monitoring our medical loss ratios in that population. We are -- we adjust reserves as we think appropriate based on the experience we're having. And at this stage, we feel we're in pretty good shape. If you are relying on that portion of the -- of your portfolio to generate profits, you put yourself in a more complicated situation because your reserves may be lower than you need at this point in time. So that's my explanation. -- Yeah. I think the only thing I'd add to that is, any initial view on the PEO side is actually very active on the HR and insurance side. So -- and we've done I think a very good job on the diligence of the underwriting and that's going to certainly continue. And so we haven't seen any uptick in claims. And Efrain said, how well we managed that and are very tight on that to begin with. But we've actually seen a lot of interest on the HR side, obviously with the complexity of the regulations that are coming out. Both the PEO and ASO part of our business, our HR outsourcing, we're the only one with 600 plus HR specialists around the country that are handling these clients, and it is -- the interest has grown very quickly.So the initial piece is, there is going to be a lot of need for the HR support, not only at the beginning of this, in case I have to shut down temporarily etc, but how do I handle the support payments, how do I handle small business loans, how do I -- what do I do with payroll taxes and all of those things. -- That's tremendously helpful. Thanks so much. -- You're welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. -- Great. Thank you so much and thanks for taking a shot of 2021 obviously in a fluid environment. Hey Efrain or Marty, just a couple of thoughts on kind of some metrics. How -- because obviously it feels like just the shock is much more broad. Is there any way to think about if somebody gets furloughed versus laid off, how that impacts kind of the business model? That was my first one. And then just what type of kind of unemployment rates are you assuming in that 2021 if there is any thoughts around that? -- Yeah. Let me start on the first one. I think it is really important. Right now, we're able -- with our new Flex technology, we're able to actually survey clients who are in our app and we've had tremendous response just in the last four days asking them what's the impact to them. And we're seeing that the vast majority of small businesses and mid-sized businesses is the fact that, about 50% -- over 50% have had minimal impact at this point. And then another 40% have basically furloughed. So, our hope and our word tracks from our payroll specialists on the service side, our salespeople are, ""Hey, if you can stay in business and keep somehow either furlough or keep paying your employees, if you can, there is going to be support."" Certainly, looks like there's going to be help coming, whether it'd be the Small Business Loan project. That's why we pushed also to offer our assistance. We have all that information. We know the direct deposit accounts in the bank. We could quickly continue to help our clients pay their employees 6 weeks, 8 weeks, whatever the government wants to do. And then, just take that money from a government loan fund versus the client. And I think that's the quickest way to keep these businesses in business.So, it is really important. And I'm seeing right now, at least leading indicator, is that small businesses are trying to hold it together, maybe lay off or furlough a few people but maintain their business model. So, that kind of depending on how long this is going to go. And if it doesn't go too long, they'll be able to bounce back. Remember, just two weeks ago, we had full employment and it was -- the biggest challenge for small businesses was finding people to fulfill the demand. I don't think that the demand in many places will actually change and I think it will bounce -- I think it'll bounce back fairly quickly. People are going to want to get out. They're going to want to get back to restaurants and new services, may do it a little bit differently and how they stand close to people, but I think they still want to get out a new services, and so these small businesses are trying to hold on to their employees. And that's going to make a big difference in how many clients are lost and how many checks we're cutting. -- Hey, the second question, Kevin, so let me just say broadly, many of our clients. If you look at our, on the payroll side -- I'm sorry, Management Solutions side, and you ask yourself when you look at our revenue, how much of it is based on a PEPM model, what percentage of revenues, versus subscription? In our case, and there's certain -- there's a general rule of thumb is about a 1/3 is PEPM and 2/3 is subscription.We assume that in the next several months, the drop in pays per control will become -- will be severe, will be pretty significant, I should say. I don't know, severe -- I know you're asking the question that everyone is, is unemployment probably go to 20% to 25%? I don't have a good crystal ball and no one else does. But I can tell you that the way we've modeled it, we see some significant contraction coming in the upcoming months. We'll see how long it lasts. We've done the modeling and think we've got at least a reasonable handle on it. So, I would say significant over the next several months. -- Great. Thanks again. Be safe. -- You're welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, guys. Just want to ask about a bridge, maybe going from the 6% or so organic growth level that we're at today, down to the slightly negative growth in the fourth quarter and then for next year. Just thinking about what's in those assumptions, including bankruptcies and other things that drives it to those levels? -- Yes. Our assumption is that there will be client losses in the base. That there will be lowered pays per control. And we've modeled it based on what we've seen in prior recessions. And then we got to figure my bad LA analogy is just simply to figure out what's the duration of the traffic jam until that that resolves. Then the question is, what's sharp rebound? How sharp the rebound is? And we think it ends up coming back toward the end of the year.There's -- Bryan, I can't give you a bridge that said it's 6% this, 3% that, because frankly the modeling is early on that. All I can say is that we've looked at the client base, stressed it, assumed certain impacts, particularly for some of our payroll client base, compared that against what we saw in previous recessions and come up with our best estimate. But we do anticipate that there obviously is going to be an impact to the client base and there's going to be an impact on pays per control. And I would just caveat it with one thing, which Marty said earlier: To the extent that the downturn is severe but more short duration, then our assumption starts to change. And to the extent that the downturn is both severe, short term and the government stimulus, which they're working through now, helps to keep some of those businesses in place. It also helps our projections.I don't have any way yet of being able to figure all of that out. We'll see in the upcoming days what it looks like. That could have -- and I emphasize could have some impact, but it's too early to tell. -- And then of course Efrain already mentioned the interest rate changes is in that as well. That's a known. -- Yes. -- It's more of a known item. -- Yes. I was going to ask. And my follow-up is, how did you account for the stimulus? They're doing a lot for SMBs to try to prop them up and keep them alive. So, is that modeled in as well or do you just model in as if there would be no stimulus? -- I think it was pretty high level, Bryan. We modeled some. I think we're trying to be a little more conservative on who would go out of business and on the checks because of that. But it was pretty -- it's pretty high level. And you didn't know where the stimulus is going to be and how long it's going to take. I think that the thing it's so important that we try to get across, I think the government has taken some great steps very quickly. This one, it could go faster. If you do use someone like the payroll processors, I think could be very quick. Or if you have to go through a loan program, it could take weeks. Those weeks are very important to how this happens, I think, to keep people employed and being paid, and businesses in session.So, I'm very hopeful that they will do something faster and because of the way they've done it already, and that that keeps these businesses running. -- Okay. Thanks for the comments. Stay healthy. -- Okay, thanks. You too.Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. -- Thank you. Appreciate the preliminary 2021 outlook, could you dimension for us your revenue exposure to some of the most affected industries like restaurants, just broadly food service, so we can think through 2021 in terms of the framework that you gave? -- Yes. Let me start, then Efrain can jump in. I think it's definitely -- I'd say, restaurants in general and those groups are probably around 5% or 6% of our base. And so, it's not as big as some might expect. So, I think that's going to be helpful and those are the industries that you're seeing obviously the most impact in some place like New York State and other states that shut down the restaurants completely.It also depends, as Efrain have said a couple of times, how long does that happen? Do we try to start to open those back up in a few weeks with even the partial -- with a 50% rule or something else? How do you -- how long do you keep them in business? But I think it's around that number roughly on a client base. -- Yes. David, so there's been fair amount of talk about how this endogenous shock is affecting the industries. Martin is right that the -- if you look at, essentially hospitality and foodservices, that's about 6% of our client base. So, obviously that's impacted pretty significantly both on the payroll side and on the PEO side, but it's 6%. If you look at everything else, for example, oil and gas is 1% and everything else is distributed in a distribution that looks pretty similar to what the broad economy looks like. So, we don't have significant exposures to one industry or the other on our payroll client base. -- Yes, one of the real positives, as Efrain mentioned about our model and our financial strength is we don't have any direct -- any large percentage in one industry, SIC code or region. And so, that allows us a lot more diversity across the base, the type of businesses and so forth. -- Understood. Just a quick final question. You noted that the business really started to experience impacts in the second half of this month versus the first half. Can you share your -- what you saw in the second half in terms of quantifying the impact on KPIs? -- Yes. So, what we -- it was, we -- so I was looking at -- we were looking at people running payroll and we weren't seeing any impacts. And it looked like clients to us were either staying at current -- with their current processing routine or in some cases they were accelerating their processing, because they were in the process of either downsizing or in some cases closing. But that didn't give us enough data, so we went back into the other data that we had on time and attendance systems, we triangulated time and attendance systems, we triangulated marketing lead sales activity and we saw significant drops starting as we rollout of state closures or state lockdowns accelerated. So that's where we saw the impact.Now, the good thing about that is that we can see what the impact is and we can see the change in the demand environment. The question is how quickly we come up out of that, obviously New York is not going to come out of that quickly. Question is what other -- what happens with other states that have gone into place? -- Yes. The interesting point, one of the interesting things is while we've seen leads drop -- drop off on the front end, but there -- but then there has been other pieces that have picked up. So there definitely down, but they're not, they're not like shut down. They're down double-digits but not as much as you might have even thought. So people are still looking for and maybe because of this looking for payroll support, HR support, insurance, those kind of things. So there are also finding that frankly, this is the time that they better go with an outsourcer and that they would want to go with somebody who is national and has the support and service teams that we have that are segregated across the entire country and that can provide great answer performance and support even with 15,000 people working from home. So I think there is some benefits to the strength of who we are in our experience level at this point in time. -- Thanks so much. Stay healthy. -- And you too.Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate you trying to provide as much guidance as you can here. Just, maybe, following up on some of the conversations that you just mentioned about the down double-digit on a lead [Phonetic] but things aren't completely frozen. As we think about the developing competitive environment as we go through the trough and come out of this. How are you guys thinking about positioning that obviously you've made a lot of investments on the Oasis side to get that fully staffed up in the sales side, but when we think about things like waving fees right now to offset pressure declines, may be receiving or the fact that you may have some pricing competition from the very crowded market. How are you guys thinking about that over the next 12 months? -- Yes. I think it's a lot more about are you positioned to help the clients through this difficult time. That's what they're looking for. Some clients are going to be looking for, hey, can you do something to help me in the short-term on price. But our prices, frankly as a cost to of a small business or mid size business is not that big compared to the other things that they're concerned about. What we are finding is our strength in telesales for example, is making a big difference. So we've been selling telephonically for some time generating leads that are then picked up and handled telephonically with the conversation, the demo and the sale all being done over the phone and even to some degree when you look at your payroll online all by the client and self-service mode, we've retrained and added training to the field sales force and handling those calls remotely. So being able to talk to clients that don't want to meet in person, but to do that over the phone to be able to demo the product and sell and complete the sale, and of course, with some of the features that we have with document management, we've had for some time. Everything can be done electronically, electronic signatures moving the documents back and forth and of course electronically on boarding someone to start them up, frankly and as a matter of a few hours.So I think what we're focusing on is all right all of our marketing and so forth is how we can help you through this. Here's the service model we can give you. Here is the product and feature set that can help you, when you think of how strong our mobile app is. We're seeing increases in mobile app utilization because, now clients -- many clients employees are remote and they are able to use the mobile app. The investments that we've made are really paying off from that standpoint of mobile app learning management on site, they can give training through their employees online. Of course, direct deposit pay on demand can help them with their only part time or they're in short shifts and they need cash, so we're positioning, this is more of the value that we're providing. And then if there's something that comes up specifically we'll talk to the client, but it's not been as much about price as it is, hey, are you the full service provider that can help me through this period of time versus someone else that I have that's not as experienced and not as strong financially. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe a quick sort of two-parter. I know Efrain you mentioned the 42-page report you have sort of running through how to think about this. If we go back to the prior downturn, I believe retention rates drop toward the mid to high 70s. How are you thinking about that relative to the great financial crisis but also someone had asked previously about the exposure to industries and how you're thinking about it versus prior downturns, but if we cross section it and say a restaurant in the Permian Basin that's more than just being exposed to oil and gas. How are you guys thinking about this? -- Yes. So good question Steven, and I would say it will go into more details and analysis of that type. As we're going through the plan process. We are right in the middle of it right now. So we'll do more work in that way. And by the way the analysis we have looks at exactly those kinds of things. But coming back to your question, when we in previous downturns, and I'm going to go back to '08 or '09, we started from a retention place that was lower than -- it was lower than where it is now. If we would have continued on the same track we were on through the third quarter, we would have had record retention, I mean we were aiming toward of really, really significantly -- significant improvement in retention through the third quarter.And if you would have said to me when I started nine years ago that we would hit that number, I would've been surprised, because we were typically in the high 70s. So we start from a good place. So that's the first part. But you have to stress it based on the change that you saw in different environments. And we've taken our best estimated what that will be. So that's where we're at right now. Looking at it versus the modeling of -- or the actual experience of previous recessions, I think we've got a good handle on dimensioning the range and then we can overlay what will happen by industry. But to Marty's point, I think there is a -- there was a -- there is an assumption that we're very exposed to restaurant. So we certainly have a certain amount of those in the base, but it's not all of the clients that we service by a long shot. Now, I will say that -- that's for payroll. It's a little bit different for period [Phonetic]. -- And Steven, I guess I just add, it is sold and determined on what Efrain said about the length of how long this goes and then is the stimulus package going to help them through the first couple of months. And then does it go another two months, three months or so forth, with the financial crisis, it went a longer, certainly I think seven quarters or so. And so if there is something that can hold them on and they can still get business even if it's take out and they can lower a few people but get support on their payroll it could make a huge difference. So we've done some initial modeling. But we really need to see kind of how the next couple of weeks even play out. -- Got it. Thanks and stay healthy. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. -- Hey Efran and Marty. Hey Efran, thanks for at least trying to put together FY '21 guidance and I'm wondering if you could just give some of the assumptions you're making on pays for control or retention, some of the metrics that you usually talk about to get an idea of what the backdrop is for your FY '21 guidance? -- Yes. Kartik, I can't get too specific about that at this point, but I would say that with generally, I'll give you a kind of a framework that we're modeling drops and pays per control consistent with some of the effects that we saw in the previous two contraction. So, we're using that as a guide for what, at least the next three, four or so months, look like. And as I said, I think we're going to have severe impacts absent whatever the buffer that stimulus provides through the -- certainly through the summer, into the early fall. So, that's one.And then in terms of clients, we've used that data as a reference point for how we're trying to think about or create a framework for next year. I think many of you have that data, understand what I'm referring to when I say that. So, we've incorporated that and obviously we need to have a framework as we go into next year. So that's, I would say, at a general level, that's what we're using. -- And then, Efrain, at the beginning, you and Marty talked about the balance sheet. I think the one benefit you have is you have an excellent balance sheet. And I'm wondering your thoughts on share repurchase. Would you -- do you feel comfortable enough that you would want to go back when it's appropriate in the market to buy back shares? Or are you at this point or want to wait and see how things progress for the next couple of quarters before you would want to go in the market and buy back shares? -- Yes. Kartik, so one of the things that's challenging in an environment like this is, in the absence of any other concerns, you would think that now is the time to start getting very constructive on share repurchase. Because we obviously think that the business will bounce back and we're highly confident that that's going to occur.So, that's the one side of the thought process. And I would say, by the way, this also, my thought -- the thought's I'm expressing also apply to the portfolio. But you have to, and I've been through this before, where we had an endogenous shock in my prior life. You have to worry about making sure that there are absolutely no questions about your liquidity, and I mean absolutely. We -- people depend on the dividend in this company. We protect that and don't want anyone to think that there is an issue there. And so, shorter term, until you have a very clear perspective on where you are, you protect the liquidity in the short term, you ensure that capital markets are functioning the way they should, and then you make decisions.So, there are those considerations that we play through. And I would say right now we are ensuring that there are no issues on that, not that would be given our cash flow generation. But it also, Kartik, extends to things like extending the duration of the portfolio in order to get more yield. Right now, we are not assuming that we're going to do that, because at this stage of the equation, we put a premium on liquidity, not that we have any issues with that. I just -- would just reiterate, we have undrawn revolver. We have almost $1 billion worth of cash. And so, there's no issues there. But you got to balance all of those pieces in terms of before you start thinking about getting constructed on share repurchase. There may be a time. We'll talk with the Board at the appropriate time and have that conversation probably. It's not now. -- And then just one last question, Marty. Marty, when you looked at the previous recessions, was there -- when we came out of it, did you see more small businesses wanting to go with an outsource provider either because of what happened or they're looking to save money? So, in another words, as we come out of this, could you see maybe an acceleration in sales because you have businesses that are not using outsourced services wanting to use the service? -- I don't think we saw -- I don't remember seeing that much of it, Kartik, at that point. But there's a couple of things that are very different in this shock that I think can help. One is the government stimulus packages and the regulation changes are very complex. And I think more businesses will say, ""If I'm going to take advantage of that, I'm going to start my business or reignite my business and take advantage of some of the things that are out there. I cannot follow that. I need outside support."" And so, I think that's going to help more businesses say, ""If I have an outsourced before or if I've outsourced to a small provider that can provide that kind of guidance like we can, hey, I'm going to go with -- I'm going to go with somebody.""Second, it's so different from a technology perspective, as everyone knows. Back then it was not all of the mobile apps, imagine where we were 10 years ago, there was no mobile apps, really there was no remote working, very little remote working. All of the things that businesses now -- and by the way, their employees are getting used to and those that you might employ or retain are getting used to, what can you do with the mobile app? Can you provide online training? Can you provide pay-on-demand? Can you provide your 401k balances and loans online? Can you do all these things online, connect with your employees? It's such a different environment. And I think this is going to change the workforce permanently to say, ""Wow, I've seen these things that I can do remotely and through self-service. I want part of that. I don't want to necessarily do old school, somebody writing a check or handing me a check even."" I think all of these things are going to get people used to a whole new world, which are going to drive more people to the technology investments that we've made.So, I think there's two very positive impacts here as we come out of this that could say more new business start-ups and existing businesses that reignite are going to be looking for someone like us. -- Hey, thanks, Marty. I really appreciate it. Thank you both of you. -- All right, Kartik. Take care.Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. -- Hi, guys. Thanks to the other guy for sharing [Phonetic]. Efrain, I appreciate the LA analogy. Thank you for that one. -- All I ask all of you is to remember when I was wrong that I at least tried. I led with my chin. -- Hey, yes. I wanted to ask, just from a business mix standpoint, can you just give us some color on where you are expecting the most and the least pressure? As we think about PEO and Management Solutions, and then the various offerings within Management Solutions that are most and least insulated here? -- Yes. So, one thing I think we should mention, I think it's been, it's part of the, I guess, the backdrop. I mean, just take off from what Marty said, build on what he said. You know, we're a very different business than we were in '08 or '09. At the end of this year, about half of our revenue or less than half of our revenue will be payroll.If you split our business, about 80% of our client base is under 20. Our revenue is split pretty evenly below 20 and above 20, 50:50. So, that's a very different animal than we were in the '08, '09 timeframe. And while we do apply that thought process to how we're looking at the future, there are some differences.I think we could see, we could very well see, to Marty's point, increased demand for anything HR services related. And by the way, if I slice now the Rubik's cube -- you can't slice the Rubik's cube. But if I slice our revenue, about 50% of our revenue is derived from HR related products. So, you could very well see an increase in demand, to Marty's point, given the complexity of what Congress is about to unleash. And let me tell you something, emails fly every single night here about what's in the bill, what's out, what the implications are? There's lots of good things in that bill for businesses, but it requires interpretation.So I would say from an HR standpoint, you could see increased demand, which Marty has been talking about. And then, on where we see more stress is on the smaller businesses, who, if they don't get a lifeline over the next six to eight weeks, are going to be severely impacted and stressed.So, I would say in broad strokes, higher demand for HR and related services. That could include PEO, by the way, because we would include that in, and more impact on smaller client simply because of the depth and the severity of this correction. -- Okay. And then just payroll tax holiday implications. We've got the question, so curious here, how we think about the impact from a potential payroll tax holiday that might be in this final stimulus bill? -- Yes. I don't think -- from a standpoint of interest on client funds that we withdraw and then pay those. It's pretty small, of course, we won't earn much on it anyway, because there is no interest. So I don't think it will be a very big impact at all. -- Yes. So I thought you were talking about what the business impact whether we think that alone would drive some significant improvement. I think you're going to have to go deeper than that to really make an impact for most clients but Marty's right. If that's a question related to interest on funds held for clients, I think the Fed's kind of help us there. If we are backhanded way. So it's not going to impact very much. -- Okay, thanks guys.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. -- Hi, good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the administrative challenges tied to effecting fiscal stimulus. I'm just curious, given how close you are to that market, what thoughts you might have on the most effective way for the federal government to handle that initiative. What would seemingly be a very difficult task given just the sheer number of small businesses in the US and obviously it's important how fast handled. So I'm just interested in your thoughts on the challenges of affecting that change? -- Yes. I think if you look back at like 2008-'09 and of course, not even close to the amount of stimulus that is being done now, things took, I think the average time it took to get a check or money to small businesses was like 50 days, we went back and looked at it. So it was roughly a couple of months that needs to be so much faster now, because of, in particular the shut downs that have occurred in many states of small businesses. They need to pay their rent. They need to pay employer -- employees to keep them with them, which, because you're going to come back I think to a pretty good employment. Two weeks ago I said it's amazing. Their biggest issue was how do I find employees to fill my jobs. And now I want to keep them. So I think, speed is such an essence and -- of such an essence. And I do think that we could -- payroll processors could be such a help because we could immediately continue to pay that payroll that we paid last week or the week before and then just look for those funds from a government program, the SBA whoever.I mean, however, they do it is fine with me as long as they give that backstop and it does look like they're going to do that to give that payroll. But if it's a long SBA loan process that takes paperwork that, etc, etc, that's not going to help us many, many you've seen of already laid off employees across the country, whether they'd be hotels or whatever. And I think they got to move really quick. Administratively one of the great things with our size and our experience is that we have over 200 compliance specialists. Our compliance people have been on the phone with the federal government, Congress, the treasury, the IRS, the SBA, you name it and are working with them not only to answer their questions about what could be done but also trying to help say this could be the fastest way to do something and so forth, and so we're very supportive of the work that the government is doing and we're very much in touch with them. And we think we could turn it around pretty quickly.We have a lot of resources. 1,500 people in IT and we've been talking daily and they understand that depending on what comes out, we're going to -- everything gets turned to that, our first thing is to comply with these regulations and be sure our employees and our clients and their employees are taking care of. -- Great. Thank you. That's encouraging. And then as my follow-up, obviously there's a lot of moving pieces right now. But I just wanted to get your sense for the impact social distancing and working from home may have on your sales force ability to sell new business particularly within PEO where we have enough white space that may be a material slowdown in new business starts is less of a headwind. I'm just curious if you'd expect sales cycle to lengthen to slow considerably. Just on account of let's face to face interaction, all else equal? -- Yes. It's kind of a mixed -- it's a mixed situation. While we said leads were down a little bit. There is still pretty strong lead flow coming in for payroll and HR and because we've had so many years of virtual selling, we have a lot of experience in selling which I mentioned earlier, we have now taken that training that have been used for virtual sales, which by the way is virtual sales is lower cost in pretty productive from a web lead perspective. And so we're now training the field sales force. Hey, here's a way if you have to do it remotely and someone doesn't want to meet, here's how we demo the product, we can use the same tools for the field sales force where they would have demoed something in person. Here's how you can do some things online and here -- and the good news is everything can be done electronically. So you don't have to be in front of a client to have them sign something. Necessarily a lot of the document management can all be done electronically and kind of a DocuSign kind of features and then all of that sent to remote on boarding specialist who can set up the client in a very short period of time.So it certainly is going to -- it has some impact in clients, not wanting to focus on it right now or meet in person. But I do think that we have a vast amount of experience in a very effective virtual sales team that that will continue to grow frankly, and the field sales force is finding ways to get in touch with their clients, get in front of their clients through email, through chat, through calls and they're very receptive to that and appreciative that we're here. It's amazing that many clients or prospects think that because you're home, they're not going to be able to reach you, that is not the case at all. We've never lost any contact with anybody. And as I said, our IT team has done a tremendous job in moving 15,000 people remote and then being able to handle it. -- Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions and stay healthy. -- Thank you. You too.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. -- Thanks so much. And Efrain really appreciated your remarks at the beginning, especially the segue from being human to talking about finance. Just one quick question. You talked about how I guess your business or your customer facing business is different now. I'm just wondering, internally, when we compare your business to the prior shocks or the prior recession. Is there anything different, or is that more of a variable cost structure than you had before. Any color would be great. -- Yes. And I'll let Marty, talk about what substantively is different in terms of how we operate. But I think, look, if you're going to service business. I said 65% people and 35% production at variable -- which is the comparison in 65% people and 35% other, not all of that is variable. I would say that that we've moved the cost structure in such a way that more of that cost structure supports the other parts of the business. I would say that structure, you guys who are you -- so that you guys, but you who are analyzing it now that that's the way most the split of cost that most businesses have is distributed differently. And so, the implication of that is that we don't have as many cost tied up in one part of the business that that we had during the last downturn that we've got a little bit more diversification across the cost base. So that we support more business that is not purely payroll. Nothing wrong with supporting payroll.But as I said before, half of our business now is HR related. So I'll let Martin talk. -- I mean, I think just from an internal flexibility, we're on a unified what we call unified communication system that we've installed over the last number of years and so we can easily move calls all across the country even to which we have never tested before having all of these people work from home which is an incredible technology different than it was in the last, and you have a lot of flexibility to have teams in different areas and move teams around and so forth. So there is a lot of flexibility here as to how you control costs, how you look at the -- your employee base and give them support tools and we've always been good obviously controlling our cost and I think having a great focus on margin and we'll continue to do that, and there is probably as much or more flexibility now than there ever was. -- Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. -- Hi, good morning and thanks for taking all of our questions. Really appreciate it. I know it's running kind of long Efrain, maybe just one question for you. I know you guys mentioned a couple of different anecdotal comments about what you've seen in maybe the second half of March. But if I could maybe triangulate a little more precisely on new booked business, what have you seen happen in terms of new bookings over the last couple of weeks? And then, what new bookings type of assumptions are you making for fiscal '21? Thanks again for taking my questions and hopefully everybody's families are safe and healthy. -- Yes. Hey, Samad. So, we wouldn't give you -- we wouldn't give precise info on bookings, and then we wouldn't typically give precise bookings on what we anticipate. But I think we all know that given lead flow, bookings are down. And given what we expect in the remainder of the quarter, we also expect them to be down. Do we expect it to be -- fall off a cliff? Absolutely not, for many of the reasons that Marty said.If the stimulus gives a jolt, it may actually be helpful. There are things in that package that may cause the businesses that are there to book other services, even if they're not booking based payroll. But this is a challenging environment for sure. -- Maybe if I could ask just one from a competitive standpoint. It sounds like price was able to stick during the F3Q. I'm curious if you've seen a change in competitive behavior, either pricing more aggressively to capture as much business as possible before the gears start to slow down? Or maybe just how are your competitors reacting from a pricing perspective in the current environment? -- Yes, not seeing -- there is some free months here and there, first three months of this service or that service. But not seeing too much, too aggressive yet. Does it get more aggressive? It may. On the other hand, I think when you look at it, again as I mentioned earlier, I think businesses are worried about a lot more than -- when you think about our average business that might pay a couple of thousand dollars a year, 2,400 a year, 2,500 a year, they're looking for whether they save 200 bucks or 500 bucks is not that critical to them right now. It's, hey, can you give me the service, and can you give me the service that I need -- the service -- excuse me, and the products that I need to survive in this environment?So, I'm sure we'll see a little bit more discounting here and there, but frankly it's a little bit misguided in the back of what clients are looking for, in my opinion. -- Yes, to Marty's point, you know, we, it's easy to overlook it. But when you have a response time measured in seconds, I'd ask you to ask all of our competitors what their response time are. Service may not seem like it's all that important in other environments. I can tell you based on the interactions we're having, we could post all of the comments that we've gotten from clients about how responsive we've been on the website, it's going to become very, very critical. One of the things that we're very proud of, Marty said it earlier, is that we moved everyone to work from home and our service times have been tremendous and our response times to clients have been tremendous. And they are asking a lot of questions. And if the -- if you can't get to them and you can't service them, they're probably going to have some second thoughts about whether they continue with you. -- Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Be well. -- Okay. Thank you. You too.Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. -- Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for the update and certainly for your appointment -- pointed sentiments earlier. Good news I think we're hearing that in the bailout so far the stimulus is providing $10 million -- up to $10 million for individual businesses and provided no layoffs. So, perhaps there is some upside to the outlook here. So, fingers crossed. Appreciate your thoughts, the double-B in the details. But I was just hoping if we can go back to the Rubik's Cube very quickly and if we can quantify your exposure between hourly workers versus salaried workers and perhaps what you've seen earlier?And then as a follow-up, looking back to the last downturn, it looks like the dividend rate was held steady for quite a bit at risk of pulling the cart in front of the horse here. How should we think about that? Would we expect to see something similar at least over the near term? Thank you. -- Yes, Pete, I don't have much for you on hourly versus salary. I'd have to get that breakdown and figure that out, so. And don't have a precise answer on that. With respect to the dividend, look, our earnings amply support the dividend we have. Whether we should increase it, will depend in part on the discussion that we have with the Board and where we are when we present the plan. We try to peg it around 80% or so. Obviously, in some situations that might be a little bit higher. So, we'll have to go through that conversation with the Board in terms of what level they want to set it out. -- Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck and be well. -- Okay, thank you. You too.Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. -- Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. -- Hi, Lisa. Sure. -- Couple of questions on workers' compensation, actually. I know we are, I guess, presumably going from an abrupt period where workers comp claims and premiums were very low to probably the inverse of that. Can you just remind us, I know the premium going up will actually be a tailwind to your insurance business, but in general, how does that kind of dramatic shift impact you? Thanks. -- Yes, it would be a tailwind to the insurance business. It would also have a modest impact on our PEO business from a revenue standpoint. So, both of those would be positive. On the other hand, where we are, where we have some at-risk exposure in -- on the workers comp side in the PEO, we'd have to monitor that, so. So, I think it's on balance more to the positive side of the ledger, and then you've just got to manage reserves appropriately. -- Yes. And then on that point is the follow-up, because I know we get questions about that. Can you just remind us, I was looking in the K, it looks like your reserve level and workers' comp is something like $170 million or so in total across like short-term and long term? -- Yes. -- And then, how is that capped or reinsured again? Can you just remind us like how much actual risk exposure do you really have? Is that the way to think about it, it's kind of that number or how does that work exactly? -- Yes, I'd have to look back. I think we say in the K what we have in terms of exposure. I think it's around $1 million, I want to say, per case. $1 million workers' comp case is a very, very unusual case in my experience. It's capped there. But beyond that, by the way, that's only part of the equation. What you have to look at is the development of claims, which we look at on a quarterly basis and add to reserves as they're needed.So, our typical workers' comp adjustments are modest, and generally we end up in a positive reserve situation, so. So, we should be able to manage well. There'll be no change in terms of the way we manage. We don't anticipate a significant impact at this point. -- Got it. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, one on the attrition. I think you've said in the past that about 9 points of your attrition each year are come from businesses going out of business, just in like a normal period. Is that about the right number? And then, can you just dimension like how much worse that got back in '09 or after 9/11? -- Yes. So, what you're doing is taking about half of the 18% that we would average. I think it's close -- it's somewhere between 8%, 9%. You can -- we'll see a spike, I can't call it yet, Lisa. But if we go back, back to '08, '09, it spiked up to about 23%, 24%. -- Yes. -- But our base was about 20%, 21%. Most of that 3% to 4% was coming from -- -- Yes, other business. Yes. No, it's exactly what Efrain said. It's -- most of that came from out of business and -- but please remember, that one went longer. So this one is just kind of hard to measure because we think we're going to have depending on the stimulus that could hold the front here for a couple of months if it really could help them quickly and then how long does it go before they open back up or give up and go out of business. It's going to be very interesting. It doesn't feel like it's going to be is bad as'08-'09 because that went on for seven quarters in businesses couldn't survive. These hopefully, they could furlough they could come back, I don't -- I really, it's obviously hard to predict a few weeks into this, but I don't think it's going to be, we wouldn't expect that would be that bad. It might be more, it's going to be more of a shock in the first probably maybe first quarter of next year, but then bounce back pretty quickly. We would think at this point. -- Terrific, thank you. Thanks for the color. -- Okay, thank you. -- You are welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. -- Hi, Marty and Efrain. Thanks for squeezing me in and best wishes to you and your families. With regards to you know the stimulus what what elements that you've heard discussed around the stimulus are you most excited about that it could potentially have a positive impact? -- Well, definitely the small loan program. The small business loan program. Anything that, as I've mentioned it would keep paying employees of small businesses and keep them in place is really important depending on how long as this goes. If it's shorter than if it's shorter rather than longer that could make a big difference as the weather our business goes out of business or not. And they keep their employees employed.I think also the unemployment benefits is also another way that of small business might say, hey, I'm going to furlough you, I might pay you. There has been different rules discussed about paying half and there is certain rules that are out there about sharing a job where you could fully you could pay someone you could keep two people instead of laying off. We got to people instead of laying off one and keeping one you could have them job share and then make it up with unemployment that could have some impact depending on where they how they handle those regulations. I think anything around supporting small business and employees with their wages is the most important to make. Hey, the Direct Checks can hurt, but I'm not sure what that's going to do as much as from a business standpoint is keeping businesses going, that's kind of how I think of it any way at this stage based on what we've seen. -- What's your level of confidence that that's -- that those elements that you cited are going to go through based on alll the interactions that you've had? -- Pretty strong. I think there has been a very little disagreement on the small business loan program. There has been, we still don't know how they're going to -- it's procedurally enacted that is important, but that's not clear yet, but I do think based on all the discussion, they're are going to try to do it is quickly as possible with as little red tape as possible, and that will be very important, but feel pretty good that those things are going to get enact that they haven't been argued much at all, it's been more of the large business stimulus giving money to the airlines, etc, that seems to have the bigger arguments. -- What sort of a marketing program could you put in place in order to take advantage of that because that obviously your capabilities to deal with something like that would be far greater than any independent companies. -- Yes, very much sort of already positioned the marketing to even over a week ago about how we can help you. And we've had webinars that have been kind of blowing the doors off from the number of people and CPA's that join those webinars because they want to know about it. So I think we're well positioned from a marketing and training perspective for our clients and prospects to take advantage of those. -- Great. If I could shift gears, just for the follow-up component. Can you just talk about the percentage of business that you have in New York in California and the states that have gone through the shutdowns and what you ended up seeing in those states during the [Technical Issues] days? -- Yes. If there is a -- there is a number of businesses not all of them are the small businesses. But I think I do think it's -- might be up around the 40 year. Well I think California alone, I don't have that data for all of the states that are shut down, which includes New Jersey, Illinois and California, New York. Of course, we kind of follow the population. So it's probably around 50% or so that are in those, but again they're not all small businesses that are necessarily impacted by the shutdowns and partial shutdowns that you're seeing. -- Okay. And what were you seeing in the states that are shut down in terms of like the very recent trends? -- Very early, but mostly, we're seeing more of the -- I'd say -- I'm furloughing -- I'm standing open, I'm doing like restaurants and again restaurants being 5% or 6%, but that's where you're seeing the most impact. They're saying hey, I'm going to try to furlough people. I'm going to try to keep my employees, maybe only keep three of them out of six or and 10 out of 20, but I'm staying open so far. And again, are those people in flex in that survey that I mentioned early on, we've gotten the huge response on that and it's still been 50% our minimal impact at this point, and another 40% are saying, I've done some layoffs or furloughs, but I'm continuing to run. That's all been very good news.What we don't have a great handle on yet is any losses, because you're going to see those more probably next week or end of this week, if they're completely going out of business. But more of the feeling is and I'm going to try to hang on you're see with the stimulus is, try to furlough my employees so I keep them and continue to do what I can with minimal staff. -- Great and then one last one. Will you come about what you're -- Mark, you're breaking up there. Could you try that again? -- Yes. Just the portfolio composition with regards to the float balance. What do you seeing there?Securities in the oil industry or your muni portfolio. -- Yes. They are solid. We haven't had any issues, haven't had seen any impairments of any securities. Obviously we we we invest in very highly liquid and and highly say security. So we had a few in the oil industry, but, but we haven't had any impairments. But it's very small part of the portfolio. -- Great, thank you. -- Okay. Thanks, Mark. Stay safe. -- You too.Your next question comes from the line of Tim Singh with JP Morgan. -- Hi, thanks. Thanks so much for the hard work here. Just on the margins. Just wanted to clarify, it looks like you're guiding to I think 35% versus the 36% this year, is that just a function of the detrimental margin of, sorry, I forgot. -- Yeah. So yeah, just want to preliminarily we see it around 35. Yeah, what's happening Tim Singh is right now, my assumption is the portfolio is down around $20 million maybe at that higher that portfolio drop straight to the bottom line without a lot of expense offsets that we assume that we're going to take actions to obviously offset expenses in other areas. But it's hard to -- it's hard in the short term. At this point offer 6 weeks of data to say here's how we go after after replacing some of that margin. I would say we're pretty good at it. If you remember, '08 or '09, we took a tremendous hit on the drop in the portfolio. Nowhere near as severe here and found a way over time to make it up, but yes that's one component of what creates the drop in margin. -- Okay that makes sense. So you're being conservative here. If things get a little bit worse, there is room to do more, but you just see it calling it as you see it and then you can move on. Got it. And then just really quickly, I know a lot of people ask good questions on the outsourcing. What happens on the recovery. How about on PEO. I'm curious if we could see a shift there, if people want to manage their medical side a little bit better, but also I guess, the risk that carriers my prices in anticipation of higher cost, but also in that might price out others. I'm trying to better understand how you think about PEO here given that you've put some more capital into that business in the last three years. -- Yes. Contingent. I mean, it's a great question. So here's how at least some preliminary thinking on that. If you have a lot of costs rippling through your healthcare plans, you may not feel them at first, but eventually you're going to feel them and then clients are going to be impacted to one extent or another. Through the course of this year and as we have managed the integration of Oasis, what we've seen is a tremendous opportunity to operate a PEO, ASO hybrid model, where were you have an ASO with the provision of benefits from our insurance agency and in some ways -- and sometimes it's better for you to go through our insurance agency on the PEO, instead of being on some sort of PEO master plan.So, I think you're going to have to figure out some -- be flexible and agile in terms of what you provide on the benefit side and what solutions you provide, either one-off through an insurance agency, a master plan or some other arrangement.So, I think what we've seen is that ASO and PEO kind of converging, and in some cases full PEO is the better model for some clients, in some cases ASO the better model for other clients. So, you could see shifts between those categories, depending on what happens in each of those markets as we go through the year. -- Yes, I think that's exactly right. You brought up the right thing. We don't know what's going to happen to insurance, right? It depends on how many claims are filed and whether you have a lot of claims, there's a lot of costs that are going to be covered, like the testing and so forth. So, it's kind of early to tell, but it will be that balance. But as Efrain said, I think then that can shift toward ASO model. But I think the PEO model will still be pretty strong. I think this is bringing awareness of insurance plans and employees.There's going to be this fight for employees again, in finding them for your businesses. And I think insurance could be an even stronger selling point, now, as an employer who is trying to hire people. So, that may bring even more cloud to the PEO, it's going to be -- it's going to be an interesting balance as we come out of this. We're well positioned, obviously, with both ASO and PEO to do that. -- Yes. You got them both. Yes, I trust you guys would be right on that. Thank you all for the candor. It's very comforting. Thanks. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. -- Hey, guys. Glad you're healthy. I was just curious as it relates to revenue sensitivity, the changes in certain key metrics, like ADP as talked in the past though, 1% change in client retention has about 6 times the revenue impact as a 1% change in bookings, just as an example. I mean, should we assume kind of similar types of relationships hold for Paychex? Or any specifics you feel comfortable sharing, just so we can think about the way forward? -- Yes. Hey, I would just say broadly a drop of -- a change in our loss rate of about 1%, yields about $25 million of impact -- is it $25 million? Well, $2.5 million I'm sorry, $2.5 million. Checks or pays per control are really the most important. So, it sounds like they're somewhat similar to what we are, so. But we'll see as we work through our plan. -- Okay. And then I just wanted to go back Efrain, to, I think, answer to an earlier question. It sounded like you guys are assuming a similar amount of deteriorate expert [Phonetic] client and in client retention as you saw the past couple of recession. So, is the reason you're not assuming anything deeper than that just because of the change in mix since those last recessions, like the HR and the PEO mix? Or are there other factors? -- Yes, Jason. That's the impact. I mentioned earlier and just providing some color, if you look at our business, 50% of our revenues are with clients that are 20, and under 50% are clients 20 and over. That's a different mix than we had during the last recession. Of course, there are scenarios where it could get a lot worse than that, depending on how long the downturn lasts. But at this point, that's our best guess on the modeling. -- Yes. Again, on the timing, and obviously not knowing that timing, but you could have this larger drop in checks in the first half of the year, fiscal year, and then come back. And that's kind of how we're thinking that over that period of time, I think over the fiscal year, it might balance out like recessions have been. So, it might be a little stronger in the early part, but I think if the bounce back -- everybody has a different view, but if it's a bounce back in the second half, that could be a pretty strong bounce back in checks. -- Right, right. So maybe a deeper trough, but I hear what you're saying. And then just last one real quickly. [Technical Issues] refunding certain fees to help customers stay afloat or defer price increases or anything along those lines? -- Well, we're looking at it. Again, we haven't had that much of a push from that's what they're concerned about and we want to -- we're focusing really on what they need at this point to survive and get through all of the stimulus packages and the downturn and so forth and the shutdowns. So, that hasn't been that critical from a client perspective. Obviously, we're looking at the price increase and I think it's going to be prudent to push that out a little bit and we'll continue to watch that as we go month-to-month. -- Okay. Thanks again. -- Okay. All right, Jason.Your final question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. -- Great, thank you. I know it's pretty late here. Just one really quick question. -- It's early for you David. -- That's one way to look at it, I guess. But, yes, just quickly on your commentary about your mix of PEPM versus subscription. I think you said 1/3 PEPM and 2/3 subscription. Can you just help us understand how you get at that? -- How you get at that? -- Yes. How you get those percentages? Like -- because it seems like a large percentage of mix is really driven by the number of employees, so just want to better understand that. -- Yes. I think it has to do with the composition of our client base, David, so. And when you're smaller, you tend to have more on the subscription side of the equation. For example, we don't separately disclose SurePayroll, but SurePayroll is purely subscription. So, PEPM has no impact on it. And then it's an estimate on other clients, how much of what they're getting is based on PEPM revenue, and that's what it ends up being. When you're smaller, your proportion tends to be more subscription, larger tends to be more on the PEPM side. -- So, what, just as an example, what are the services you're including in that subscription bucket? -- It's just primarily payroll. So, but that's a big chunk of the Management Solutions revenue. -- Got it. All right. That's it from me. Thanks again. -- All right, David. Thank you.And there are no further questions. -- All right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. We do wish the best to all of your -- yourselves and your families. And good health to all of you. Thank you for participating in this call. It will be archived for approximately 30 days. And again, we appreciate your participation and interest in Paychex, and stay safe everyone. Thank you.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on March 27, Paychex Inc's Director, Tom Bonadio, invested $99,973.50 into 1,650 shares of PAYX, for a cost per share of $60.59.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Wednesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) and achieve a cost basis 2.4% cheaper than Bonadio, with shares changing hands as low as $59.12 per share.  Paychex Inc shares are currently trading off about 3.4% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of PAYX shares, versus its 200 day moving average:


   

Looking at the chart above, PAYX's low point in its 52 week range is $47.8727 per share, with $90.535 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $60.68.  By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which  was recorded over the last six months:



The current annualized dividend paid by Paychex Inc is $2.48/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 01/31/2020.  Below is a long-term dividend history chart for PAYX, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 3.9% annualized yield is likely to continue.

"The coronavirus pandemic has hit a lot of small and mid-sized businesses hard. These are the types of companies that   provides with payroll, human resources, retirement, and insurance services through its platform.Is the company well-positioned to help its clients through these uncertain times while maintaining solid earnings growth? Let's look at where Paychex stands and whether it's a buy.Image source: Getty Images.Paychex has been a solid performer, with an annualized return of 10.7% over the last 10 years and 13% over the past five years through Dec. 31, 2019. Last year it beat the S&P 500, returning nearly 35%. This year, the stock is down about 18% as of midday Wednesday.In the third quarter of its fiscal 2020 (which ended Feb. 29), the company reported a revenue increase of 7% from the previous year's quarter to $1.1 billion.Paychex got a revenue boost from its acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing Group in December 2018. Oasis is a professional employer organization, or PEO, which enables companies to outsource human resources, employee benefits, payroll, and risk management services. Paychex's revenue from this segment was up 10% in the quarter to $271.5 million, driven by growth of the client base.The larger management solutions business -- where the company provides payroll and human capital management solutions through its platform -- saw revenue jump 6% to $850 million for the quarter, driven by gains in new clients and deepening offerings with existing clients, particularly in the areas of retirement services, among others.Overall, net income increased 9% to $354.5 million while earnings per share (EPS) climbed 9% to $0.98 per share year over year.Because Paychex's third quarter ended before most states implemented stay-at-home policies, its strong earnings results do not, for the most part, reflect the extent of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the company made a number of technology-based upgrades over the past year and a half that will help clients navigate the challenges.One of the upgrades is called HR Conversations, which allows employers to two-way-message remote workers through its mobile app. Another new feature is called Pay-on-Demand, which lets employers pay workers more quickly and provides the flexibility to pay on various shifts. In addition, the new Paychex Flex Help Center gives clients access to training resources using predictive learning and natural language processing.""The significant investments we've made in our technology, and in particular our mobile app, and our expanded product and features in our service model options, allow us to support our clients in any environment,"" Paychex President and CEO Martin Mucci said on the  on March 25.The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act, which became law last December, should also present Paychex with additional opportunities for growth. The law provides incentives for employers to offer retirement savings plans, and, as a leader in 401(k) recordkeeping services, Paychex is well-positioned to help clients and gain new ones.As it moves through the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2020, which ends May 31, Paychex anticipates annual revenue growth of 8% to 9% for the full year. Net income and diluted earnings per share are expected to rise 7%. The company also projects a robust 36%  and 41%  margin for the full year. In the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue is expected to be down slightly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses.The guidance includes estimated effects from the pandemic and the zero-bound interest rate environment, but given the unprecedented uncertainty, officials acknowledge that it could change. ""So far, we've seen minimal changes in our key metrics. However, with the expanding shutdowns of businesses throughout the nation, we do expect that this will be particularly challenging time for small and mid-sized businesses,"" Mucci said in the March 25 . Paychex will provide guidance for fiscal 2021 next quarter, but CFO Efrain Rivera said a preliminary view reveals flat to low-single-digit revenue growth. That's roughly $20 million below 2020, with an anticipated profit margin of about 35%. The preliminary forecast is for a rocky Q1, followed by improvement in Q2 and Q3 and recovery in Q4. The good news is Paychex's financial position is sturdy, with cash, restricted cash, and corporate investments totaling about $930 million. Cash flows from operations are $1.1 billion for the nine months of the fiscal year, an increase of 3% from the previous year. That ample liquidity, along with access to short-term financing, will support ""normal business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future,"" said Mucci. Paychex's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has taken a dive in this crisis, recently rebounding to near 23 -- still comfortably below its recent levels. At its current valuation, and with its added scale and outlook for sustained growth, Paychex should get through this in pretty good shape and remain a .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Stocks are dropping and yields are rising, but that isn't exactly a dream come true for income investors, as a lot of stocks taking on water are likely to slash their dividends as the economy turns.

Let's go over why they're some of the top stocks for income investors.Image source: Getty Images.A wireless carrier would seem to be reasonably resistant to the coronavirus sell-off. Telecommunications solutions offer a safe way to stay connected, and a wireless bill is an essential utility in 2020. It's against this backdrop that AT&T became one of the more than 5,000 companies to hit fresh 52-week lows on Friday and in the process pushed its yield all the way up to 7.4% this weekend.   Things aren't perfect. AT&T recently announced that it's closing 40% of its company-owned stores in light of COVID-19, and the cancellation of sporting events and movie theaters is weighing on its DIRECTV and WarnerMedia businesses. It also  and is reportedly exploring taking on $3 billion in new debt to help through the downturn. No dividend may be entirely safe, but AT&T has come through with 36 consecutive years of boosts.The country's second largest provider of payroll, human resources, and benefits outsourcing services may seem like an odd consideration in this climate. Paychex thrives in a buoyant economy, and it's not a good sign when Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin warns that the unemployment rate may soar to 20% in the wake of the coronavirus shutdown. Paychex still deserves a look, and its yield enters the new trading week at nearly 4.8% after getting roughed up with the general market. Paychex has proved resilient in the past, and it will get a chance to earn a bounce when it reports financial results for its fiscal third quarter. Owning Paychex ahead of an earnings report is a smart move. It has boosted its guidance in -to- reports.  It's true that Cisco isn't the glorious speedster that for a brief moment before the dot-com bubble burst was the country's most valuable company by market cap. You have to go back to fiscal 2010 to find the last time the networking gear specialist has posted double-digit revenue growth. However, with the stock now tumbling to the point where it's yielding just north of 4% it's a good time to sing its praises, as Cisco is holding up fundamentally well in this climate. Analyst profit targets have budged in recent months, a time when many Wall Street pros are talking down most of their earnings estimates. Cisco has beaten analyst profit forecasts every quarter over the past year. Some bulls see the stock as a . With many employees encouraged to work from home, demand for Cisco's network devices and software has probably never been higher. There's more to  than just high payouts.

For more details on this strategy, About Joel Greenblatt: In his 2005 bestseller The Little Book That Beats The Market, hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt laid out a stunningly simple way to beat the market using two -- and only two -- fundamental variables.

Greenblatt also produced exceptional returns as managing partner at Gotham Capital, a New York City-based hedge fund he founded. The firm averaged a remarkable 40 percent annualized return over more than two decades.About Validea: Validea is an  service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Friday, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.9, after changing hands as low as $53.50 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 32.9.  A bullish investor could look at PAYX's 28.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of PAYX shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, PAYX's low point in its 52 week range is $47.8727 per share, with $90.535 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $54.38.

"The  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive.  Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.


But making Paychex Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Thursday, shares of PAYX entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $79.96 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  

In the case of Paychex Inc, the RSI reading has hit 27.4 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 29.5.  A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield.  Indeed, PAYX's recent annualized dividend of 2.48/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 3.01% based upon the recent $82.28 share price.


A bullish investor could look at PAYX's 27.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.  Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on PAYX is its dividend history.  

In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the First Trust Horizon Managed Volatility Domestic ETF (Symbol: HUSV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $29.57 per unit.


With HUSV trading at a recent price near $21.10 per unit, that means that analysts see 40.16% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of HUSV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX), Berkley Corp (Symbol: WRB), and STERIS plc (Symbol: STE). Although PAYX has traded at a recent price of $57.62/share, the average analyst target is 44.74% higher at $83.40/share. Similarly, WRB has 42.78% upside from the recent share price of $47.51 if the average analyst target price of $67.83/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting STE to reach a target price of $169.00/share, which is 40.25% above the recent price of $120.50. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of PAYX, WRB, and STE:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"Investors eyeing a purchase of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $87.82/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2022 put at the $65 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.60.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4% return against the $65 commitment, or a 2.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).



Selling a put does not give an investor access to PAYX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $65 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Paychex Inc sees its shares decline 25.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $62.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.60 from $65), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.1% annualized rate of return.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65 strike is located relative to that history:
  

   
The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2022 put at the $65 strike for the 2.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Paychex Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $87.82) to be 16%.  For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.
							
							
In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 2.06M contracts, with call volume at 2.06M, for a put:call ratio of 0.74 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65.  In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today.

[EditorÃ¢ÂÂs note: Ã¢ÂÂThe 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable ReturnsÃ¢ÂÂÃÂ was previously published in November 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]One of the most popular investment strategies is to focus on fast-charging growth companies. The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adageÃÂ cash is king. The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call Ã¢ÂÂcash cows.Ã¢ÂÂWhile no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a businessÃ¢ÂÂ lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.Another reason to look at a companyÃ¢ÂÂs money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options. They can choose to put money to work through key investments, or to expand operations.And if the worst happens, and the underlying industry hits a recession, cash cows can better weather the storm. Because of this dynamic, youÃ¢ÂÂll want to at least peek at the cash flow statement for your target investments.Below are the eight best cash cow stocks to buy now:	IÃ¢ÂÂm going to make a confession straight off the bat. I donÃ¢ÂÂt understand why people eat at  (NYSE:), particularly those who do so regularly. Admittedly, they make great coffee and their French fries are to die for, but the rest of it? Not quite so appetizing.Nevertheless, I donÃ¢ÂÂt need to understand a phenomenon to recognize that itÃ¢ÂÂs working. Moreover, those who are looking primarily for reliable stocks to invest in should seriously consider MCD stock.Last year, the iconic fast-food company generated net income of nearly $6 billion. In its most recent reported quarter, MCD produced earnings per share of $1.99 in-line with analystsÃ¢ÂÂ average estimate.Additionally, McDonaldÃ¢ÂÂs enjoys consistent FCF every year, offering invaluable confidence in a rising, but unpredictable market. Plus, MCD pays out a 2.34%  yield, which management should have no problems sustaining.	We often say that there are two guarantees in life: death and taxes.

Just for the consistent demand, AFL should be on most peopleÃ¢ÂÂs list of stocks to buy. And as you might expect, Aflac enjoys robust cash flows from operations.AFL is one of those conservative stocks to buy that have performed well in the markets. Since this time last year, shares are up 11%. Better yet, Aflac pays out a 2.05% dividend yield. Steady growth and passive income? AFL is too good to ignore.

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.48), with the stock changing hands as low as $82.52 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.  Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.



In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Paychex Inc, looking at the history chart for PAYX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

"hareholders of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.9% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2021 covered call at the $87.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $5.10 bid, which annualizes to an additional 5.3% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 8.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away.  Any upside above $87.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but PAYX shares would have to climb 3.3% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 9.3% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

			
In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Paychex Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for PAYX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield.


   
 Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $87.50 strike highlighted in red:



   
The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 covered call at the $87.50 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $87.50.  ().  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Paychex Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $84.73) to be 18%.

In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.21M contracts, with call volume at 2.05M, for a put:call ratio of 0.59 so far for the day.  Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in options trading so far today.

"ayroll and human resources leader 's  swiftly expanding professional employer organization (PEO) services tend to capture investors' attention, and indeed, in the company's fiscal second-quarter 2020 report released Wednesday morning, PEO growth outpaced that of the rest of the business. However, Paychex's core management solutions services, which comprise about 73% of total company sales, displayed their own healthy acceleration this period, leading management to positively recast full-year earnings guidance for the second time in as many quarters. As we delve into details of the last three months, note that all comparative numbers that follow refer to the prior-year period.Data source: Paychex. Image source: Getty Images.In Paychex's earnings press release, CEO Martin Mucci highlighted the balance between business segments, while enumerating the specific areas in management solutions that saw outsize performance during the quarter. Mucci also discussed the  that Paychex is using to attract new companies while shoring up its current customer base:During the second quarter, we delivered solid growth across our major business lines. In particular, our human resource (""HR"") outsourcing services, time and attendance solutions, and retirement services performed well.We are heavily focused on continued innovation to meet our customers' and their employees' evolving needs, simplifying HR complexities and offering solutions to help them thrive and grow. We are investing in innovative technology in the areas of flexible payments, integrations, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, while still maintaining our commitment to personalized service. Our state-of-the-art technology and exceptional service distinguish us in the market as we deliver a more personalized and technology-enhanced experience for our clients and their employees.For the second quarter in a row, the business administration  revised elements of its fiscal 2020 outlook -- most of them in a positive direction. The company lifted management solutions' projected year-over-year revenue improvement from 5% to a range of 5%-5.5%. PEO and insurance services' top line is now chalked in to grow 25%-30%, against a prior estimate of 30% -- signaling potentially slower expansion than management previously expected. Similarly, interest on funds held for clients is now expected to land at 4% year-over-year growth, in comparison to an earlier range of 4%-8% growth. Finally, management bumped up its diluted earnings-per-share forecast from a 9% improvement against fiscal 2019 to a new range of 9%-10%.

"uman capital management provider   released  on Wednesday, and added to stock gains that have now reached 26% year to date. Investors were pleased with the balance between the company's acquired revenue boost (via the acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing in December 2018) and brisk organic revenue growth.In Paychex's , management discussed several innovations it intends to use to keep core management services customers -- its bread-and-butter payroll and human resource clientele -- engaged. Below, let's look briefly at three innovations mentioned by CEO Martin Mucci on Wednesday's call, and their potential impacts on the business.We are excited to be introducing pay-on-demand and real-time payments. By the end of calendar year 2019, Paychex clients can allow employees to access a portion of [their earned] pay before the scheduled check date. With many Americans living paycheck to paycheck, this advancement in technology allows financial flexibility when needed.Payroll providers like Paychex and competitor  roll out a continuous stream of minor enhancements each year in order to boost their value propositions to customers. But Paychex's new accelerated payments initiative actually seems like a meaningful offering that will help build loyalty and attract new customers.While pay-on-demand (which allows employees to access a portion of paycheck funds in advance of a scheduled deposit) is an enticing convenience, real-time payments is a technology that companies can promote as a benefit to current and prospective employees. Real-time payments, which Paychex will make available in early 2020, bypass traditional ACH payments and associated processing times, and essentially place funds instantly in employee accounts once a payroll is approved.This may also have the beneficial effect of slightly increasing Paychex's funds held on behalf of clients (on which it earns interest), as companies utilizing real-time payments will need to have their payrolls funded slightly in advance of current deposit schedules that are oriented around the slower ACH system.  Through machine learning, our chatbot continually expands its knowledge base and provides a more robust data set to leverage and formulate answers to frequently asked questions. During the past quarter, we approached a quarter of a million sessions interacting with the Flex Assistant. The bot is able to address approximately 200 commonly asked questions, and that number is growing.Management sees Flex Assitant, Paychex's chatbot, as a tool that can be used to cut the cost of customer service while improving customer satisfaction. For those who run into problems on a chatbot query, the company offers one-click access to a live agent on a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week basis. Agents can personalize their service based on a customer's employee's past interactions with Flex Assistant.There's also a significant longer-term advantage to Paychex's investment in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven customer-facing technology. Mucci stated on the call that Paychex is a ""rich and reliable depository of data gathered from interactions with clients."" At a run rate of nearly 1 million interactions per year, Flex Assistant is not only optimizing its behavior and its ability to correctly answer customers' employees' questions, it's also exponentially increasing the amount of data Paychex has on customer behavior. The company will be able to reap benefits by analyzing these innumerable interactions, and glean insights that will suggest new products and services having a high probability of success.Image source: Getty Images.We are singularly focused on continued innovation to meet not only our customers but also their employees' evolving needs, simplify HR complexities, and offer solutions to help them thrive and grow. Also we're offering cyber [services] -- cyberattacks are [a] growing threat to businesses of all sizes.Before we get too carried away here, I should note that Paychex isn't getting into the cybersecurity business in addition to implementing AI customer service solutions. Rather, the company is now offering its clientele cybersecurity liability insurance via its Paychex Insurance Agency and a third-party insurance carrier.Mucci observed that such insurance is vital for smaller businesses, and that 60% of enterprises with less than 1,000 employees fail in the brief period of six months following a cyberattack due to lack of sufficient financial resources.This insurance offering, while thematically , is more of a financial innovation, as it demonstrates Paychex's savvy ability to develop new revenue streams and sell add-on products to payroll and benefits administration customers. This also speaks to the efficiency of Paychex's business model, in that buyers of its payroll services tend to be long-term customers with whom it interfaces on a weekly basis. So opportunities to upsell abound. Cybersecurity liability insurance is but one of the latest examples of a growing portfolio of new revenue opportunities Paychex will enjoy in the coming quarters.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Paychex wasn't one of them!

"ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at , in trading on Thursday, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.48), with the stock changing hands as low as $80.00 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.  Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.



In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Paychex Inc, looking at the history chart for PAYX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

ayroll, human resources, and professional employer organization (PEO) giant   enjoyed the contribution of significant acquired revenue as well as brisk organic growth in the initial quarter of its new fiscal 2020 year. The corporate services specialist released its scorecard on Wednesday, and shareholders responded in generally enthusiastic fashion, bidding up shares by 2% on the trading session. Let's home in on the relevant details from the past three months and also walk through management's positive revision to the organization's full-year outlook. Note that all comparative numbers that follow refer to the prior-year period.Data source: Paychex. Image source: Getty Images.Earlier this year, I discussed Paychex's , which contains core services such as payroll and benefits administration and accounts for about 73% of total company revenue. In particular, Paychex is focused on automating services and ramping up  as a means to improve customer service -- and boost profit margins. In the organization's earnings press release, CEO Martin Mucci provided examples of the types of product advancements the company believes will maintain the loyalty of its most important client base:We are committed to offering advanced solutions to help our clients thrive and meet their evolving business needs. During the quarter, we provided a set of enhancements to our solutions that will streamline payroll processes and support business owners and HR professionals as they work to optimize operations, comply with regulations, and drive productivity.We are excited to be introducing several new solutions at the 2019 HR Technology Conference & Exposition, which is currently taking place in Las Vegas. This includes wearable technology for tracking time worked, pay-on-demand, the next generation of the Paychex Flex intelligence engine, and an API integration network. Our investments in technology focus on meeting the evolving needs of our clients and their employees by providing a more flexible, personalized work experience. Paychex increased its expectations on certain fiscal 2020 outlook items on Wednesday, reflecting management's confidence following a decent start to the year. Management solutions revenue is expected to expand by 5% this year, versus a forecast for 4% year-over-year growth provided in June. The company specified that PEO and insurance services revenue should grow roughly 30% in fiscal 2020. Previously, management had provided a range of between 30% and 35%. As for earnings, Paychex pushed its growth expectation for both net income and earnings per share (EPS) to 9% in fiscal 2020, versus a previous projection of 8% growth. Adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are also now anticipated to advance by 9%, versus a prior range of 8%-9%. While the company's outlook revisions are fairly modest, they were nonetheless welcomed by investors, who realize that it's still early in the fiscal year. Ample time for further outlook fine-tuning remains if Paychex continues to see appreciable core growth in the coming quarters. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

By the end of calendar year 2019, Paychex clients can allow employees to access a portion of the earn pay before the scheduled check date.

It is particularly critical for businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees since 60% fail within six months of the cyberattack due to a lack of resources to offset the breach.Shifting to our PEO business, the acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and double the number of work site employees we serve in our PEO. We are making steady progress on our integration plans and we are now focused on completing the integration of our sales and service teams.

The continued efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients, is making a difference.I'll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera and Efrain is going to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? -- Hey, thanks, Marty, and good morning. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted operating -- diluted earnings per share, sorry. Please refer to our press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the first quarter to their related GAAP measures.I'll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas; I'll wrap with the review of our fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw, total revenue and total service revenue both grew 15% for the first quarter. Our growth excluding Oasis was between 5% and 6%. Expenses increased 18% for the first quarter to $643 million. Increases in compensation-related costs, PEO direct insurance costs and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth for the first quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis.Operating income increased 9% to $349 million. Operating margin was 35.2% for the first quarter. EBITDA increased 13%. And EBITDA margin was approximately 41% for the first quarter. Margins were moderated by business mix due to growth in the PEO business and accelerated investments in sales, technology and operations.Other expense net for the first quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of $8 million related to our long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we used $800 million of private placement bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. Effective income tax rate was 23.3% for the first quarter compared to 24.5% for the same period last year.Net income increased 8% to $264 million and adjusted net income increased 6% to $258 million for the first quarter. Diluted EPS increased 9% to $0.73 for the first quarter and adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $0.71. We received approximately $0.02 of benefit from stock-based compensation payments during the first quarter, which we exclude in our adjusted diluted EPS.I'll now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management Solutions revenue increased 5% to $724 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services and growth in revenue per client, which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. Retirement Services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participant funds and we had a strong quarter in Management Solutions, if you recall the guide I gave you for Q1.PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased 56% to $247 million for the first quarter. In addition to the acquisition of Oasis, the increase was driven by growth in clients and client worksite employees across our combined existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue was moderated by softness in the workers comp premiums. This was partially offset by an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants. Interest on funds held for clients increased 20% for the first quarter to $21 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased 1% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year.Investments and income; we continue to invest primarily in high -- not primarily, but in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1% currently and an average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the first quarter, up from 1.8% from last year.I'll now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of approximately $700 million as of August 31, 2019. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion, consistent with the balance as of the end of last fiscal year, May 31. I'll remind you that funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the first quarter.Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $53 million as of August 31, compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. Stockholders' equity was $2.5 billion as of August 31, reflecting $222 million in dividends paid and $172 million worth of shares repurchased during the quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a robust 42%.Cash flows from operations were $295 million for the first quarter, an increase of 8% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis.Now let me talk about guidance for the balance of the year. I remind you that our outlook is based upon current view of economic conditions and trends and business trends continue with no significant changes. So we have reflected the impact of the two interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. So we are not at this point including additional guidance on further rate cuts; we're uncertain about what will happen in the balance of the year.I'll provide our current outlook and then add color in a couple of areas. We provided updates to the guidance. As you saw, on the strength of a strong quarter in Q1, we now think Management Solutions revenue is anticipated to grow 5% above the range of previous guidance of approximately 4%. We thought that first quarter would be a sequentially a little weaker; we actually got out of the gate a little bit stronger. PEO and Insurances revenue is now anticipated to grow approximately 30% at the lower end of the previously provided range of 30% to 35%, more to come on that but we started a little slower than we had originally contemplated.Other expense net, which was previously referred to as net interest expense, is anticipated to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million, a modest change from previously reported guidance of $15 million to $18 million here due to interest rate changes. And if you remember what that is, is a combination of interest income and interest expense. So the decrease in interest rate changes effects what we will earn on the corporate portfolio.Net income and diluted earnings per share are both now anticipated to grow 9% above the range of our prior guidance of approximately 8% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to increase approximately 9% above the range of our previous guidance of growth in the range of 8% to 9%. Other guidance remains unchanged. Interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow in the range of 4% to 8%, that's what we said at the beginning of the year and that's what we're sticking with. We assume that there was a good probability that there would be a second rate cut it happened and that was contemplated in the guidance.Total revenue anticipated to grow in the same range of 10% to 11%. Operating income as a percent of total revenue anticipated to be approximately 36%, although inching ever so slightly up. EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%. And the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, although we anticipate that now will be toward the high-end.As I indicated PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow approximately 30%. We anticipate that growth for the second quarter will be in the range of 56% to 60% and growth in the second half of the fiscal year will be within the range previously provided of 11% to 14%, but at the lower end of that range. PEO and Insurance revenues growth was partially impacted by change in classification of an immaterial Oasis revenue stream out of PEO and Insurance services into Management Solutions after we last provided guidance. So make sure when you look at the presentation we posted that you got the right beginning number; it's not a big difference, but make sure you're working off that number as you look at updating your models.Management Solutions; in addition, we've experienced, sorry, -- lower workers' compensation insurance rates that moderated our insurance services growth, it was a little softer than we had anticipated in Q1. We anticipate the trend eases as we go through the year, but started a little bit slowly there and we are also anticipating modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in our PEO business based on current trends and the number for us, if it's not at risk insurance, we don't recognize it as revenue. So our business can do very well without having significant at risk insurance attachment. We looking at the trends, think it'll be a little bit lower than we had originally projected.Now in contrast, Management Solutions guidance was increased to approximately 5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 4% growth due to favorable trends we've seen during the first quarter. In addition, Management Solutions has increased partially due to the change of classification of the immaterial Oasis revenue stream and had a negligible effect in the first quarter and will have a negligible effect for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter, we expect growth at approximately 5% and then between 4% and 5% in the back half of the fiscal year.Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, very quarterly as you probably captured in your models for Q2, we expect margins to be in the range of 33% to 34% and for the second half of the year, we expect to see them at approximately 38%. So in the second half we are anticipating at this point approximately 38% margins; I got asked a lot after the guidance that we expect to see higher margins in the back half of the year and the answer is yes.Now, I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And with all of that, I will turn it back to Marty. -- Thank you. Efrain. Maria, we will now open the call to questions, please.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a kind of a general question about your pricing strategy. Marty, you walked through a lot of really interesting kind of product innovation that's happening. When you are able to raise prices, is it always in conjunction with a new enhancement to an additional value or are you still able to just raise prices on a renewal just due to the underlying kind of stickiness and competitive moat of the product? I'm just trying to understand whether pricing is kind of tied to innovation or really it's just something you can leverage due to the underlying kind of competitive moat you have. -- Yeah, I think it's still both. I think we're seeing not only for the innovation in bundling more things together, but also the normal price increase that we've given guidance on pretty consistently is held up pretty well. So we had our kind of normal annual price increase and we've seen that hold up pretty well. And I think that's part of what you're seeing Management Solutions is holding is better than we originally projected, it's because of that. So we have the pricing power both ways, I feel at this point. -- Okay. And then on the PEO and Insurance segment in the quarter, so the deceleration -- and there are few puts and takes there that you mentioned -- both of you mentioned. The softness -- is the implied sort of deceleration in the quarter in PEO and Insurance is just really solely or more due to the softness on the insurance side. Can you sort of speak to the underlying growth rate of PEO sort of ex-Oasis in the quarter and kind of disaggregate the Insurance from the PEO performance for us? -- Yeah, thanks, Ramsey. So I would say, just to be clear, the PEO business has been growing solid double digits. So it grew very well in the quarter. We knew that workers comp was coming up against a tough compare because much of the softness in workers comp occurred in the back half of last fiscal and so it was a little bit more pronounced that we anticipated; that's part one. And then part two is, in the PEO, the attachment of at-risk insurance impacts the revenue; it has no impact, there is very little impact, I should say, on margins. So we saw a little bit less at-risk insurance attachment in the quarter. I would just mention that that varies widely from quarter to quarter. So you can find a big client that has a lot of work -- I'm sorry, that has a lot of healthcare attachment, the revenues go up; it really does -- it changes your margin, but it doesn't do much for the bottom line. So we saw a little bit of softness on both of those. -- That's great color. Thanks so much. -- Okay.Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. -- Great, thank you. Hey, Marty. Hey, Efrain. Nice job on the Management Solutions. Can you give us a sense of how much of that was better retention as opposed to just any thoughts around kind of what drove that upside? -- Yeah. I think I'll let Efrain speak to some of it too. The client retention has continued to be at our highest level. So we're feeling very good. We ended last year with a record high, and we continued right through the first quarter. So we feel very good about the client retention piece of it and then there were a few other changes that Efrain is going to speak to. -- Yes. So, Kevin. We saw, as Marty mentioned, strong, strong retention in the quarter. We had strong rate meaning combination of discounts and price increases sticking those were good. We had increases in the client base. We had a lot of good things happened in the quarter that make us incrementally more bullish. I'd say two other things that are important relative to the results in the quarter. The first is that we saw very good performance coming out of our mid-market segment on the sales side, which has also helped. That was really not a significant contributor, but it made us incrementally more bullish going into the back half of the year. And the other thing I would say is that we saw strong performance coming out of our PEO business from a sales standpoint that also even though the revenue was a little softer. We feel pretty good about where we're at. And by the way, just a final point on that, you know, worksite employees -- before I get the question, worksite employees -- worksite employee growth was strong in the quarter. -- Great. And then it's interesting because obviously you're seeing overall payroll slow. It seems like your business fundamentally is accelerating. Marty, is that kind of the benefit from the investments in the last couple of years or you're kind of repositioning the Company or just any thoughts on that? -- Well, yeah, I think we definitely have been repositioning the Company from a couple of standpoints. One is from a tech perspective, the Company is much more -- Paychex is much more of a technology company now providing service as well than it has been in the past and all the investments are really paying off, like the things that I listed out. This is and it's impacting not only the clients in their retention and their value and satisfaction, but also the employees of the client. So our business and the products that we're introducing very much focus on the employees and it's kind of perfect timing for a market that's difficult to hire and retain employees for small and mid-sized businesses. So the fact that you have a 401k for example that you can sign up for -- participants can sign up in four clicks on a mobile app that's a five-star rated app, it makes it easier to sign up. That participation is up double-digits and that drives better retention of 401k; that also drives retention of the employees and it's better for the clients.The other positioning of the Company is certainly more to HR. The sales process today is very much about an HR overall need than it is for payroll by itself and we've been positioning the Company that way, whether it's through PEO or frankly through the power of kind of over 3,000 sales people. We use the power of those 3,000 sales people to not necessarily the old way sell payroll then call them back for other services, but basically look at their needs upfront and sell the value of HR in the full product suite that Paychex can offer upfront. So definitely the Company has been -- we've been repositioning the technology side of it and the HR side of it, and that has made a big difference. Payroll has become more or less -- more of a commodity type of thing and the need of the client has been much more about HR retirement, the HR generalist; we have 600 HR generalist now out there serving the worksite employees that we serve either PEO and ASO and it's a huge need now given the changes in regulations in complexity. -- Thanks so much.Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. -- Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. -- Hi, Rayna. -- Hi. You called out another strong sales bookings quarter. Could you maybe discuss in which products and segments in the market you saw the best growth? -- Well, we don't break it down too much that we get past selling season in the next quarter so when we have a better sense of the year, but definitely, as Efrain mentioned, the mid-market sales in particular, we saw very strong growth. And this has been more of a challenge in the last couple of years for us. Once we got the investments in technology and product out there, we also have a very solid leadership team in that mid-market and we performed extremely well in that first quarter.So I would say, certainly, the PEO, the retirement business, etc., but when you look at the mid-market stands out, certainly from the start of the year, and actually as we ended last year as well, but this first quarter was really strong in the mid-market. That's a real positive to us because we had -- certainly over the last couple of years, hadn't been quite as strong as we thought we needed to be and we're very pleased with where we started out. -- Great, that's very helpful. And you called out a number of real-time payment products. Can you maybe discuss the timeline for roll-out and the revenue model associated with these products? -- Well, the end of this calendar year, we'll have the kind of pan demand so to make sure that we're clear on that. So they pay-on-demand obviously offers employees of clients the ability to take some wages out earlier than waiting for their two-week period or etc. Real-time payments we see coming in early 2020. We think will be one of the first, if not the first, to offer real-time payments. This is really more of an accelerate -- we offer same-day ACH today. If you have a last-minute change in your payroll, if you need to make some changes, if you need to do something at the last minute and be sure the funds are there and there is some charges for that and we expect there'll be some charges for real-time payments, which takes that to the next level of making it immediately available. Real-time ACH has -- ACH same-day has some limitations from a timing perspective depending on banks and so forth and real-time payments will really kind of wipe out most of those limitations and you'll be able to get funds in your employees' accounts basically in real time. -- Great, thank you. -- Okay.Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if any follow-up on the improvement that you called out both in Management Solutions and also the mid-market. Is that more a function of the enhancements you've made with Paychex Flex? Any color you can put around that. And also maybe just talk about how much of that's being improved by the sales force enhancements and channel strategy? Anything in terms of color you could provide around that would be great. -- Yeah, sure. I think it's a bit -- it's a little bit of both. I think certainly the product is the enhancements to Flex have been pretty significant, not only from the payroll side but the integration side and all, some of the products and features that we discussed today, even like the payroll grid offering many more options and making it just easier for them to use from a payroll standpoint, but the integration of the HR and I think the sales team and sales so their effectiveness and the sales approach being much more about HR first instead of leading with payroll is coming in and offering the full suite of products that we offer. And then, also as I mentioned today in the comments offering others to have -- we have us full set of APIs to other providers of on-demand services and HR products and accounting products and that is getting broader, and I think we see that as well.We certainly offer a one-solution set. That's the great thing about Paychex. We can have it all fully integrated into Flex if you want it, but if you're on an HR or an accounting system that you want to make sure you keep an interface into Flex, you can do that as well. So I think that approach -- and also think the employee approach, Jim, that I mentioned earlier, really doing things with the mobile app that is making self-service more available to their employees, not only their check stub, their W-2s, signing up and signing off on time in attendance, changing schedules, setting up your 401k; all of that is adding a lot of value to the mid-market in particular and we're seeing that pay off for us. So we're very pleased with the first quarter start. -- Great. And then maybe as a follow-up. On the PEO, the reduced guidance you called out several of these idiosyncratic factors on the Insurance side, but I want to make sure that I'm clear in terms of what you're seeing in the core PEO business. Is there any slowdown there either in terms of market demand or from a competitive positioning standpoint? And maybe just talk about how the Oasis expected growth is doing relative to what you thought was going to be. -- Yeah. So, Jim, so two parts of that. So the short answer is, no. But let me explain why because it's important to understand. So when some questions started to rise -- starting to get calls relative to what are you seeing with respect to worksite employee growth within existing clients, I did a deeper dive to understand what was going on and we are seeing solid worksite employee growth within existing clients. So that was an issue that came up and was commented on. So we're not seeing any of that. That's one. Second, if I look at worksite employee growth, worksite employee growth again has been solid in the quarter. So we're not seeing anything there.On the Oasis side, in order for us to get fully optimized on the sales side for Oasis, we're in the process of ramping our sales efforts there and I think that process is ongoing. So it's -- there -- I agree that it's somewhat idiosyncratic the reasons for the slight modification in the guidance, but it has no -- it really is not indicative of any changes both in demand patterns and in or the underlying market. If I called out the growth rate on sales in PEO, I would just say this, it's multiples of revenue growth. So that's one reason why we feel pretty comfortable about where we're at. -- Yeah. And the trend in Oasis you're seeing? -- Yeah, I was just talking, primarily on the sales side, the integration is going well and we're in the process of pulling it into the Paychex family growth. -- Yeah, we're at the point of just finalizing the all the combination of the sales teams and the service teams. But we feel like the integration has gone well and we're feeling very good about it. We're also, of course, you know, with Paychex and with that integration, we have the insurance agency, the 21st largest in the country. So when underwriting, if it doesn't fit the PEO, we have that option to take them through the insurance agency that some of the changes that Efrain mentioned as well, we're getting more through that insurance agency and that's going as well. So you don't want to turn down a client, that many times Oasis had to turn down in the past possibly over underwriting, we can now move them to the agency and offer them insurance through the agency itself. So we feel good about the start here and the integration is certainly on track. -- Good to hear. Thank you very much.Our next question comes from James Berkley of Wolfe Research. -- Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Not to beat the dead horse on the PEO side, but I guess just trying to be like more direct. Are you guys still trending, a couple of quarters ago, you said bookings in PEO space for like low-double digits, are you guys still in that range? And then on the worksite employee growth, I think it was double-digits last quarter. Can you confirm, it is still double-digits this quarter? -- I think I said that, James. It was strong. -- Okay. And then, I guess, Efrain, just we talked a few days ago, I guess, just about that new HRA rule. It could be helpful just for investors to hear your thoughts on the impact there. It's coming into play in January 2020. -- Yeah. So this is new legislation that makes it easier for employers to use HRAs as an alternative for funding of healthcare plans and the questions that have come up from investors around the impact on the PEO side of the ledger, will this impact annual growth and we've looked at it. Of course, until it's in place and people are actually having the opportunity to take advantage of HRAs in a different way, it's -- you can't say 100% but we feel pretty comfortable that should not have a significant impact on PEO growth. -- Yeah, we've had -- we've offered HRAs through -- for some time. I don't think even with the legislation that gives some support and credits, I think, it doesn't seem like employers are going to run from traditional insurance plans to do the funding. We've offered those, as I said, for some time and seen -- not have seen a great uptake. I think there are some businesses that do that but I don't think there'll be any major shift that we would expect that's going to happen from traditional insurance plans over to the HRAs. -- Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. -- Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess, I'll ask the inevitable macroeconomic question. Marty, can you give some color on what you're seeing on sort of the second order dynamics around the macro environment? I know you've a very unique look into things like obviously employment growth but also like small business survival rates, the attach rates, the value-added services like benefits, etc. Can you give us a little color there? Thank you. -- Yeah, I think we reported our small business index yesterday and it actually we had an uptick from September to August, and one month doesn't make a year or trend but job growth actually ticked up a bit, and these were businesses under 50 employees and we saw some growth not only in that -- or improvement in the job growth, it's still down about 1% less job growth from last year, but this was the first time we've seen an uptick in a couple of years where moved up month to month.We also saw wages in hours worked up. So wages looking pushed up from about 2.6% wage increase the 2.8% and hours worked went up. So I think small businesses are still feeling overall a little shaky on the economy and what's going to happen, but generally they're getting good product demand for their services and there is still their biggest challenges hiring enough people to fulfill the demand. So -- and we also did a business sentiment report and everything was positive, everything had gone up from the previous report probably six to nine months ago that felt that it would be easier for them to -- a little bit easier for them to hire, a little easier for them to get capital.So I think while the economy itself makes them a little cautious, I think that they're feeling like right now they're getting good product demand and their biggest challenges hiring. So you saw the hours go up because they are working with they have more to fulfill the demand and the wages are going up as they're trying to raise wages to get to pick up the employees. So overall, pretty positive actually with our latest report that just came out yesterday. -- The other thing we said, and Marty mentioned this yesterday, is SMEs are typically a little less impacted by slowdowns in global trade. So that segment of the economy obviously larger multinationals and enterprise level companies are starting to feel the pinch. You're not feeling as much of that lower down the employee count. So it's not impossible to have results like this in one segment of the economy where you see more concerned and pessimism in another part of the economy. -- Yeah. We've talked about tariffs and trade issues and we found in serving clients that about three-quarters of that small businesses are not impacted. Generally, they are regional businesses. They are the lawyer's office, the doctor's office, the restaurants, etc., the contractors, they not impacted. The 25% or quarter that are, have a little bit tougher time changing their supply chain and so forth, they don't have the leverage of larger companies, but three-quarters of them really don't feel like they would be impacted by trade issues or tariff issues. -- All right. And then maybe as my follow-up, can you and this private -- Efrain, give your perspective or your best perspective on how you anticipate the PEO business performing if and when we see a macro slowdown. I mean, I know there is an argument that PEO should actually tick up because the cost and economic value proposition is so strong for small businesses, but then on the other hand, it's also got a perks component to it. Just what's your view on that? Thank you. -- Yeah. So I think the first thing to understand that question is, what's the average size, at least in our base, for PEOs and typically a PEO in our world is in the 25 to 30 employee range. So you're comfortably out of the 20 and under-zone where you would tend to see more of an impact from a macro slowdown and what I mean by that specifically is 20 and above, you start to see a lot less impact from business failures in the event of a downturn. You see that Increasing as you go down the employee count. So now you're in an area of the economy where -- the employers where you tend to see less of an impact from macroeconomic slowdown. And then the question is, in that kind of environment, do you have a greater demand for HR services or do you have a lower demand for HR services, and when you think about it, the balance really kind of lies on a greater demand for managing your workforce in the event of a downturn. So I wouldn't go so far as to say it would not be impacted. I think there'll be some impact, but it will certainly be less impacted than a typical small business would be. -- And less impacted we are than we used to be. If you went back to the last recession and we were primarily a payroll company, I think, we feel that really half of our revenue coming from non-payroll services and moving to more than half and from non-payroll that also changes kind of the impact to us as a company in a recession area. -- And one final point on that, Marty raises, which is important, when we went into the recession last time, which was in the '08 time frame, we were heavily dependent on float income; almost 30%, somewhere between 25% and 30% of our net income was generated by float. We're completely different company now. And I've heard people make the argument and -- hey, look I like a good argument like anyone else's, but I do think the data suggests that were different. -- Terrific , thanks guys. -- Okay.Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, guys. I was just looking to get a couple of clarifications. What was the revenue growth contribution of Oasis in the quarter? Trying to get to an organic growth number in the PEO and Insurance in the first quarter. -- So, Brian, I called it out as a little less than 10%. Organic growth was between 5% and 6%. -- Inside of PEO and Insurance? -- No, no, total revenue. We didn't split it out like that. I just caution that that if you want to know what the growth rate for PEO was in the quarter, PEO -- not PEO and Insurance, it was solid double-digit. -- Yeah. I just was trying to get there was about a $15 million gap I think in Street numbers in PEO and Insurance versus the actuals. It sounds like -- -- Yeah. Yeah, so part of that, Bryan, I called out; part of it is that at the end of the fourth quarter, we made a small classification change in staffing revenue, which some people picked up and some people did not. I would just caution that you could come back to me offline and I'll walk you through the numbers, but the starting point was a little bit different. We made that change, not everyone picked it up. So I think that's part of it. I think that's generating part of the change there. And so part of that moved into Management Solutions. That probably accounts for a good chunk of the difference. -- Okay, helpful. And then just on that guidance in PEO and Insurance to be toward the lower end of 11% to 14%. Is that that the workers comp will drag a little longer than you expected? Just trying to make sure I understand the change. -- Yeah. Workers' comp started a bit more slowly than we had anticipated in Q1. And I called out at-risk healthcare and insurance attachment rates based on what we saw in the first quarter. We are walking through all of that with now three pieces of the PEO and we think that that number is going to be a little bit lower, but I would just caution one thing about that that really doesn't have that much of an impact on margins. And then the second thing is I could come back next quarter and say, hey, the attachment rate actually ended up being a little bit higher. It's a little bit tough to nail it with precision, but we'll keep updating it. -- Okay, super. Got it. Thanks guys. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. -- Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So just to stick with Oasis, briefly, I think based on my math, Oasis did maybe $85 million or so in the quarter, which I think was maybe $5 million or $6 million below last quarter. Just wondering if there's anything to highlight on the step down, if there is any seasonal factors to consider, and if that was in line with your expectations as of last earnings call. -- Yeah. I don't do on the spot math. I would say that our -- it always was pretty much in line with our expectations. So I'd have to go through that with you to make sure that you are using the right set of numbers. -- Okay, fair enough. And then with respect to the PEO market, I'm just curious you've seen any changes in the competitive landscape recently. I think more specifically I'm curious about when you're going head to head with another PEO, which I recognize isn't as frequent, but when you are, what are the determining factors for winning or losing business? And relatedly, how important is pricing in those conversations and if you've seen any changes in the pricing dynamics as well? Thank you. -- Yeah, I really haven't seen any changes in the competitive market for PEO, and in fact, I think with Oasis and giving us some new markets, we're in some new markets, it really comes down a lot of times from a competitive standpoint. So you're not seeing something -- you really I think more competitors I think it's the same competitors and we're a little bit larger obviously now at this point being the second largest, and I think it's really the insurance plans, which we feel very good about having the insurance plans and of course the service that you provide with the HR specialist. And I think we've been able to demonstrate that we've been in this business for a long time both PEO and ASO, and by the way, we can offer either one of them that's part of the new branding of Paychex One is the brand of our HR outsourcing.So you can go PEO, you can go ASO with us. We've been in this business for 20 years. We have 600 HR specialists out there and we have great insurance plans and we continue to expect to have those. And that's really what it comes down to is, what's the service model, what the insurance plans that you offer, what's your history in the ability to offer that service. The competitive nature hasn't changed much. I think we're very well positioned to win in this market. -- Hey. One other point to your earlier question and you can call me back offline. I would caution with saying that that revenue is sequential in PEO; certain quarters there's cyclicity in quarters. And typically in the back half of the year, you have higher revenue than the first half of the year. So it's not, preferred compare to look at it quarter-over-quarter because it bounces around now. -- No, that's helpful. That's kind of what I assume, that's why I asked. So I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. -- Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions on the HR and the Management Solutions side that was clearly better you laid out a lot of reasons but versus your 3% to 4%. What was the difference there, another reclass maybe contribute a little bit, but can you comment on payroll HCM pricing maybe raking for. -- Yeah. We still would have had 5% in the absence of the reclass. So I just want to make sure that that's clear. And the other thing I want to make clear is that I did call down in Q1 due to a composition of days issue in the quarter that did hit us. So we had just stronger performance through a combination of both. As we discussed earlier, pricing, client growth, stronger mid-market performance on the sales side; the combination of all of those just ended up being stronger than we had anticipated, which was a good turn for us. -- It is, that's great. And then on the -- just on the quarterly EPS, Efrain, I think last quarter you mentioned in the first half, net income would run low single-digit growth. This came in ahead. Can you maybe help us recast second quarter versus second half, if you don't mind? -- Yeah. Well, I guess what I'd say, Tien-tsin, as I gave a fairly good guidance on what we expected revenue was going to be in the quarter and what we thought margins were going to be. So I would say, it's implicit in what we were saying was that I give you a decent number for Q2 that we expect to Q3 and Q4 we called out operating margins being at approximately 38% for the back half of the year. So it's going to be better, and at this point, there is an element of conservatism to what we're guiding. We're still in an uncertain interest rate environment. So we want to preserve a little bit of flexibility if the Fed decides that it wants to continue to cut without altering the guidance. So back half from an EPS standpoint is going to be stronger than the first half, even though we got off to a pretty good start in the first half of the year, I should say. -- Yeah. No, for sure, I know that tax and interest played some smaller roles to there. So the last one, I think, you mentioned there, Efrain, so 38% second half margins, is there any change or and that's using that as a baseline for fiscal '21? -- Yes. There is a big danger Tien-tsin, let me explain why. So when we did -- when we adopted revenue recognition, what it had the effect that was moving a revenue stream into Q3 that had previously been spread across a number of quarters. When you do that what ends up happening is that you cyclically -- cyclically, wrong word, you create a situation where Q3 is always going to be your highest margin quarter, and the reason is very simple. You simply have more revenue with no greater associated costs. All of that drops to the bottom line and you are typically seeing, although I called out 38% for the quarter, it's not going to be uniform --- I'm sorry, 38% for the back half, it's not going to be 38% in Q3 and Q4. Q3 will be higher than Q4. And so that's the danger. If you just take that as the run rate for margins going forward, you're kind of not taking into account the Q4 -- I'm sorry, Q3 is going to be a higher margin quarter now going forward. Having said all of that, we do think that that all things being equal, we think that expenses will trend down in the back half of the year and we'll have some opportunity to improve margins from where we are as we go into 2021; hard to believe [Speech Overlap], but hopefully that's helpful. -- It is. No, I was just looking for clues as you guys are obviously going to get a little bit of benefit from some of your investments. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. -- Yep.Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wald of Morgan Stanley. -- Hey, good morning. Maybe just following up on the margin question. If there were a couple of things or one thing that you could call out to hold you back, whether it's perpetual reinvestment or just faster than expected mix shift, like what would keep you from something like notable margin improvement starting in 2021 and how should we think about that conceptually? As you talked about like moving toward less of a payroll model more of a tech model, how should we think about the margin conceptually in that lane? -- Yeah. I guess, I'd like to defer a better or more complete answer to the second half of the year because trends will become more evident, but if I were to point to one thing, we've had relatively high spending and what's been kind of unusual about our performance is that we haven't taken any charges. We have made changes on the fly, we've delivered double-digit EPS growth and we've done that all within the context of the kind of programs that we run. So we understand that as we exit the year some of that spending will decrease, we know that, we're working on that actively, and the question is how much we'll have better sense of that as we go through the second half of the year.The investments have paid off. I think that the results we're seeing reflect that and I think that all of the technology advances and improvements that Marty was mentioning are really the fruit of that accelerated investment, but you don't continue to invest at that accelerated pace. You pull some of it back down. So we anticipate as we go into '21, that's what you would see. -- Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. I think earlier in your comments you talked about this shift away from being sort of thought of as a traditional just payroll-driven model toward the tech offerings and all the products you guys have been rolling out, and all that makes sense. I guess, just as we think about it from a macro perspective and what we sort of seeing in your data ADPs [Phonetic] broader macro data, are you guys prepared or of the mind that we shouldn't think of Paychex as being heavily levered to shift and implement? -- Well, I think certainly not as levered. It's going to have some impact, but I think as Efrain mentioned earlier in a question probably more specifically on the PEO, payroll was, especially the small business payroll was very much tied obviously to new business start-ups and losses in businesses going out of business because of a tough economy. When you're 50% or more and more of an HR time and attendance retirement etc. services non-payroll and not so focused on just the smallest clients.It's going to have a different impact because in a recessionary period or a down turn of employment, you're going to have a bigger need for HR, how do I retain who I have, how do I maybe lay off people, how do I make changes in cost structures. These are all from our clients perspective, there is a huge need for HR support, and other products and technology like self-service. When you think about 10 years ago, we didn't have a mobile app that had much of it on a self-service from an employee basis and we can save -- we're now saving clients a lot of money and better -- and giving them better productivity by saying, hey, if you want to change -- if your employees want to change their address or change their deductions, etc., they can do it all on their phone by themselves now. They don't need to call and go through, you call us etc. So the dynamics of the company and the clients and what they need us for has changed pretty dramatically and I think that -- and certainly that was our positioning that we started moving toward many years ago to say, hey, you can't just be a small business payroll company, you got to be an HR and a complete outsourcer to small and mid-sized businesses and that certainly is going to have much less of an impact if there is a recessionary time. -- One of the other thing I would add to Marty, this is just sort of concretely in terms of what we've seen over the last three years certainly since the end of fiscal '16. If you look at our financials, at the end of fiscal '16, about 60% of our revenue came from payroll, 40% of it was what we would have called HRS. If you look at where we're of this forecast, obviously, it depends on what model you are using, but payroll now is in the mid-40%s with everything else being 55%. That trend is something that's deliberate, not something that is happening to us. As Marty said, that is the positioning that he and the management team have adopted and the numbers bear it out and I do think that we have evolved very clearly to a tech-enabled services company that is much more HR focus than it was three years ago. -- All right, thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen. -- Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the real-time and on-demand pay the offering rollouts that you've. Can you comment on who may be partnering with those? I'm curious if the strictly for account deposit or card offering there as well. I'm just trying to the mechanics of that offering and how it rolls in your model. Thank you. -- Yeah. Bryan, I think we'll announce that probably a little bit later as we get into the last quarter -- calendar quarter of this year for the pay-on-demand and because I guess I just want to be sure we're all together on before I announce it publicly who the partner is; there certainly is a partner there that we're doing it with. And then real-time payments, it's the same thing; one of the major banks, and I would wait until we get closer into the first part of the year just to make sure that everything is from a competitive standpoint, I don't want to give out too much too early, but we have partners in both, fairly solid relationships, everything we feel is in place. I just would like to announce those more as we roll it out; one will be in the next really now we're in October next couple of months and then one will be early 2020 for real-time payments. -- Okay, fair. And then just a follow-up on the Insurance Services business. The pressure from the workers' comp rate there, just your outlook on went out abates. Is it still just the moderation as you go through the second half comps? -- Yeah. So it's a little bit lighter in the quarter than we had planned. And so I was a little bit more cautious as we went through the year. Our expectation is that in the back half of the year, it starts to abate and then by fiscal '21, I keep saying that, but fiscal '21 we should be past [Phonetic]. -- So the attachment rate is pretty solid. It's a continuation of the rates that this is -- it cycles in and out, and we're just in that cycle where there is lower workers' comp rates and sales are OK. In fact, the attachment is up from last year on clients, but the rates are just lower and that driving in the revenue down and you got to kind of wait for the cycle back around. -- Okay. Thank you very much.Okay, Bryan.Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. -- Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask question about the new Paychex Solo offering and I'm curious how we should think about in terms of the size of the opportunity and what maybe go-to-market model is. Is it still got of direct sales organization or is it going to be similar to maybe some of your competitors to have more of an inbound type of model for their small customers? I'm just curious. -- Yeah. I think it's going to be a little bit of both. They certainly can be referred and sold by the field sales force. We're also going after it through the web and for leads and then the direct sales -- telephonic sales force will be out selling it. We think it's a big market from a sole proprietor standpoint. When you -- we found is there is that need for the retirement product and of course the incorporation services, and then if you find that sole proprietor that needs payroll and we can incorporate payroll, a simple retirement product and incorporation, we think we've got a nice market there. It's pretty new. It seems to be off to a good start, but I think we want to see it for a couple of quarters. But it has got a nice opportunity from that micro, this whole proprietor really marketplace as an offering, but it can be sold from a web lead, from telephonic sales or from the field as well. So we think we've got it covered across the field sales forces and we think we've got a nice tight clean product that will have some opportunity there for us. -- Great. And then maybe a question similarly on the other end of the spectrum. I mean, the Company has invested significantly in its technology and a lot of the commentary today has been focused on that. I'm curious how you guys think about potentially starting to move upstream or targeting larger customers based on the technology investments that you've made and maybe what the Company's view on that is. -- Yeah. I think our view is really that still that under 1,000 -- I mean, we'll have some clients over 1,000 employees. But we focus -- there is a big market and when you think about those mid-market, this 20 or 30 employees to 1,000 is a very big market that we think we're very well positioned for. Certainly, we have been from a service perspective, personal service perspective, but also from now from the technology perspective in the breadth of services in the need for those HR services have come down in size so much over the last three to four years and I think we've been very well positioned for that.So really not looking to get into that 1,000 plus generally unless there's a specific need that we can fill there, but we think that the best value, best margin and best approach for us is to stay very focused on a kind of 1 to 1,000 and specifically how we handle under 20 and how we handle 20, 30 to 1,000 is what's really taking off from a technology API in breadth of offerings that we provide. That's where the best margin is, that's what I think we're very well positioned from our experience and product set to be successful at. -- Great. Thanks for taking my questions and look forward to visiting the Company at HR Tech today. -- Okay . -- Thanks. We are looking forward to it.Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. -- Good morning, Efrain and Marty. I was wondering, with regards to Oasis, just how much of that end up contributing to the expenses for this quarter and how should we think about that furthering and being rationalized is as this year unfolds and going into next year. -- Yeah, Mark, I mean, I mean a lot of it as we call out in the [Technical Issue] in the press release is driven by Oasis, in particular, the amortization expense and operating expense associated with Oasis. You know, our -- there is a lot of combination going on there, but combination of expenses, the expense growth ex Oasis would be somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. -- That's very helpful. And then with regards to what you're seeing from a competitive perspective and then viewing that vis-a-vis all of the technology improvements that you've put together, what are you seeing in the 5 to 20-employee market, how should we think about that? And I'm particularly interested in terms of the new initiatives that you have in terms of being online sales, online implementation that was something that you talked about during the last quarter, what are some of the early results there? -- Yeah. They look pretty solid, Mark, particularly I'd say 5 to 10, we focus very much on virtual sales or telephonic sales and in driving those leads. We were doing the 1 to 4 leads internally with telephonic sales because of the speed from lead to close and we had a lot of success as we built the teams out for that last year. We moved the 5 to 9 leads, the majority of those inside the web leads to the inside sales teams for the same reason, we're off to a good start, both on lead demand generation, the way we nurture those leads and get them to inside sales and then our handling those leads that also frees up the field sales forces to get more of the larger customers in that, let's say, under 20 in that frees that small business rep team up to do that.So we're seeing a good start to the year on that. Competitively, not seeing any big changes there. We're seeing kind of the same players. I know there is one that's talking about that they've been going down market. I haven't really -- we haven't really seen an impact of that much at all. I think again the investments that we made in the technology, the reputation we have for service to that under 20 really bodes very well for us. So I think it's, we haven't seen a big change in the competitive environment and actually, we're off to a pretty good start we feel. -- Great. And then with regards to interest rates, obviously, the Fed has done some things, but rates are actually going is different than what they were basically targeting. When we take a look at like your incremental effective yield in terms of what you're placing now relative to what the effective you have us on the overall portfolio, how does that compare [Indecipherable] right now? -- I think you're probably, Mark, somewhere in -- boy, you asked a great question, which requires layers of layers of explanation. So I will try to summarize it. Unlike other people 45% to 50% of our portfolio is invested short term. So you get an immediate decline on the short-term part of the portfolio by whatever the Fed does. So if you're in the 1.5% range, that's what you're getting on the short-term portfolio, and then if you drop, you lose the 25 bps that -- if you have a decline of 25 bps then you're going to lose immediately 25 bps, I mean, immediately, but 30 days or so.So, on the short-term portion of the portfolio, that's what happens. On the long term, it's a little bit trickier because there you're really kind of turning that portfolio over about 20% of that portfolio turns over and I think that we called out in the script. It's a little bit above our effective yield notes, a little bit above 2%. Current investment rates will depend on that frankly on the shape of the yield curve, which in some ways is anyone's guess, but I would say, now you're your 25 bps to 50 bps below where you were when you started the year.Now, I just read an article yesterday. I'm sure you read the same articles I do about kind of what the Fed is anticipating doing or not doing so and I caution taking it to the bank, but that's depend indicator of where we are. And then the final thing which is the third part is we do have opportunities if we see where the yield curve -- the shape of the yield curve to extend duration, right now, we said duration was about 3.1 [Phonetic]; we had flexibility to go longer if we want to, so all of those are the puts and takes. -- I was specifically thinking about that 20% that's rolling over. That would be incrementally invested relative to -- -- Yeah, yeah, that's what I said. So you're probably in the 25 bps to 50 bps below. -- But relative to the effective yield that we're currently getting. -- Yeah. Right. I'm sorry, yes, yes. -- Okay, great. And then with regards to some of these new initiatives that you're rolling out that I'll be demoing today at HR Tech, what sort of contribution do you think they're going to end up having as you start making the plans for '21 and how does that impact the size of the sales force? -- Yeah. I think from -- I'm glad you're out there. The group is excited to demo everything at HR Tech. I think it's always with us with a number of clients we have, it's a small impact to start as we ramp up penetration rates and attachment rates. But I think it does bode well for '21 to get these things and see how we're growing. From a sales force perspective, I think there could be continued growth there, but I think we're also looking for continued productivity with the sales force. We have a very talented sales leadership team and sales force that is always looking to sell more products in the way we're approaching as I mentioned earlier is the power of those 3,000 plus reps selling kind of all of our products, not just the yield traditional way where we would sell payroll first and come back and we're finding much more success, whether it's the small market or the mid-market kind of coming in looking for the value, the client is looking for overall, the needs that they have and selling that completely. So we may have some continued increase in reps, as we see opportunity and there'll be also some increase inside and outside probably from a telephonic sales and field sales perspective. -- Great. Thanks.. -- Okay, Mark. Take care.Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the commentary around the mid-market sales. You certainly sounded bullish there. It sounds like you think that trend is sustainable. So I just wanted to get your perspective from kind of share gain standpoint if you think that this is something that's going to be continuing for a while. So it feels like historically market is maybe where you would highlight some more competitive intensity and now it sounds like you're clearly making some strides to overcome that. -- Yeah, I think a couple of things; one, I think from a share perspective, the market has continued to grow. So the good news is while I think we certainly are doing well from a competitive close rate when we're in there, the market itself is growing. So the need for HR has continued to come down in size, so clients that were looking for different solutions at 100, 200 to 300 employees are now looking for those at 50 employees or 40 or 30 employees. So meaning full time and attendance, you just see the over-time rule just came out and changed and put more focus on over-time. Clients will be looking for more time and attendance solutions. And when you can now have the technology of wearables and geo-fencing to say, hey, if they're working remotely they're working from home or another location, you can track all that and they can do it on their watch, all those things make you very viable to even a smaller client than used to think they could afford that kind of thing. And the smaller client needs it.So the market itself is growing from an HR and full service perspective, and then I think the competitive environment really hasn't changed much. I don't -- there hasn't been new competitors; different competitors have their strengths and weaknesses. And I think right now between the technology and the service model we have, I think it's a very strong, and we do feel very good about the first quarter and I think what we feel like the momentum is there for certainly the rest of the year and beyond. -- Okay. And Efrain, I think it may have been two quarters ago, you had suggested Oasis could do $335 million to $375 million in revenue in fiscal '20, if I've got that right. Is that still the right range? And any thoughts on where within that range might be most likely now that you're about a third of the way through the year? -- Yeah, I don't recall that specific one, but I think we're in that range, Jason. The one thing I would caution is that's total, there's a few revenue streams in there that are reported not just on the PEO side; part of the classification change we made at the end of the year was one of those revenue streams and we had been reporting part of the ASO revenue that Oasis provided. It's not a huge amount, but it's part of that total. -- Okay. And then just real quick last one, buybacks uptick pretty materially this quarter. Just an update on what's left on the authorization there and any implications or ways we should interpret that in the context of what might be in your M&A pipeline? -- Well. That's a good one, Jason. That's a good -- that was good, I was tracking there. So, yeah, no, look, shares had crept up -- that was a good one, I would say; that's a question of the day. Shares had crept up a bit and -- just because it was clever, the shares it crept up a bit and we're committed to keeping our share count flat. So we thought it made sense to be a little bit more aggressive. It really has no implication whatsoever on M&A. We've got still a lot of dry powder and we got a lot of opportunities that we're looking at. And then finally, I think we've got about $250 million or so left on the authorization. But, you know, look to the extent that we needed to get more, we could of course have that conversation with the Board. -- Yeah. Got it. Thank you, guys -- You're welcome.Our last question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. -- Great, thanks for letting me back in. Hey, not to belabor the attrition, but Marty, you go to kind of more of the tech-enabled HCM kind of the incremental disruption from switching full suite versus payroll. Does that reset the opportunity on the attrition side longer term, and is there any way to think about what a longer-term target would be with the kind of new revenue contributions? -- Yeah. Good question. I think it does to some degree, although you still got to think about the mix of the clients. So with our mix still definitely toward the low end and with the growth of that under 20 market, that won't change too dramatically, but it certainly gives us a much better retention tool when you think about also the mobile app in the tied to employees. The services that we're selling more and more to the direct employees and how they're using that mobile app really gives us kind of a fresh start on retention. But to the degree that a large majority of our clients are still under 20 and that base is still susceptible to start-ups and turnover and that kind of thing. So can we get retention better overall, I certainly we're always looking to break records on it. I don't think it will be huge though, given the makeup of the client base. -- Hey, Kevin, one build on what Marty said, so while we report client retention, your question really goes to revenue retention and revenue retention has been running in the mid-80s and so I think that as more of these products stick, you do have an opportunity even if a client retention is not materially different to have a bit better revenue retention and so certainly we would hope to see more of that. -- And that probably gets wider tend that revenue retention versus client, is that a fair way to think about, Efrain, versus history? -- That's correct. Yeah. -- Thank you. -- Okay.And that was our final question. -- Operator, I think that's it, right. All right. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"[Editor’s note: “The 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable Returns” was previously published in March 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]One of the most popular investment strategies is to focus on fast-charging growth companies. The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adage cash is king. The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call “cash cows.”While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a business’ lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. That’s why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.Another reason to look at a company’s money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options. They can choose to put money to work through key investments, or to expand operations.And if the worst happens, and the underlying industry hits a recession, cash cows can better weather the storm. Because of this dynamic, you’ll want to at least peek at the cash flow statement for your target investments.Below are the eight best cash cow stocks to buy now:I’m going to make a confession straight off the bat. I don’t understand why people eat at  (NYSE:), particularly those who do so regularly. Admittedly, they make great coffee and their French fries are to die for, but the rest of it? Not quite so appetizing.Source: Shutterstock
	Nevertheless, I don’t need to understand a phenomenon to recognize that it’s working. Moreover, those who are looking primarily for reliable stocks to invest in should seriously consider MCD stock.Last year, the iconic fast-food company generated net income of nearly $6 billion. In its most recent reported quarter, MCD produced earnings per share of $1.99 in-line with analysts’ average estimate.Additionally, McDonald’s enjoys consistent FCF every year, offering invaluable confidence in a rising, but unpredictable market. Plus, MCD pays out a 2.3% dividend yield, which management should have no problems sustaining. We often say that there are two guarantees in life: death and taxes. In reality, we should add a third, which is random events that conspire to ruin your day. Whether it’s a massive accident or a debilitating illness, stuff happens. When it does, ’s (NYSE:) insurance products can help you or your family recover financially.Source: Shutterstock
	It’s amazing how much a relatively common occurrence, such as a broken leg, can add up to serious . Just for the consistent demand, AFL should be on most people’s list of stocks to buy. And as you might expect, Aflac enjoys robust cash flows from operations.AFL is one of those conservative stocks to buy that have performed well in the markets. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up 11%. Better yet, Aflac pays out a 2.1% dividend yield. Steady growth and passive income? AFL is too good to ignore.If you’re asked to come down to the human resources department, chances are, it’s for unpleasant reasons. Nevertheless, HR plays a crucial role as it deals directly with a company’s most valuable asset: people. You can never go wrong with experts in this field, which is why  (NASDAQ:) is a consistent winner.Source: Shutterstock
	But another factor boosting PAYX is their product flexibility. Despite their big-name brand, they offer  for virtually any organization. From tiny businesses with a lone employee to major, multinational firms, PAYX can tailor-fit an effective, efficient platform. That will come in handy over the next few years as new businesses focus on agility rather than brute size.As you might expect, Paychex features a healthy balance between growth and cash flows; PAYX is up 15% year-over-year.The video game sector offers some of the best stocks to invest in. Thanks to gaming culture and tournaments going mainstream, this is an industry that will perpetually rise higher. Over the longer-term, this presents a viable tailwind for  (NASDAQ:).Source: Shutterstock
	Admittedly, though, the ride in ATVI hasn’t been an easy one. While its YTD performance is pretty much flat, shares have gyrated severely multiple times. Investors have an understandable concern that they’re buying into ATVI near at or near its highs. Moreover, Activision has suffered significant competition; namely, ’ “Fortnite.”Still, I’m not worried. In terms of first-person shooting games, ATVI is still the king. Its “” series is legitimately a cash cow. Furthermore, Activision’s financials have consistently demonstrated rising cash flow from operations. That might take a hit this year due to the competitive environment.However, don’t count out ATVI. Not only can Activision leverage its own strengths in shooter games, “Fortnite” mania .Out of all the cash cow stocks to buy,  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) stands alone. One of the chief reasons why is due to the company’s prevalence across multiple lucrative markets. From laptops to cloud computing to driverless-vehicle technology, GOOG disrupts any sector it wishes.	Source: Shutterstock

But the biggest reason I like Alphabet is that it . I realize that it’s a tired argument because everybody has mentioned it. That doesn’t mean, though, that the argument is any less valid.For instance, we all know that Google is the , but the gap between first place and second-ranked Bing is a whopping 66%!Moreover, Google is the unquestioned leader of mobile and tablet search engines with a 93% market share. In order to get anything done online, you essentially must go through Alphabet. And if your company doesn’t rank well on Google, you’re dead in the water.On the surface, it appears big tobacco firms like   (NYSE:) face a double-whammy.Source: 
	First, Americans are . Also, the under-18 crowd isn’t taking up the habit like prior generations had. Second, the vaping market has exploded in popularity thanks to its cleaner platform.I don’t think it’s over for Philip Morris. For one thing, several markets, including the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, have witnessed a . That, of course, suits PM perfectly, which is the international arm of the iconic tobacco firm. PM stock has rebounded this year. On a YTD basis, shares have jumped 15%.Best of all, Philip Morris is a cash-rich organization. That provides substantial confidence in the company’s generous 6.1% dividend yield.Thanks to an unpredictable political environment, and an extremely-competitive atmosphere, several pharmaceuticals have underperformed this year.  (NASDAQ:) is no exception, with GILD shares having fallen 1.5% YTD under choppy conditions.Source: Shutterstock
	But in the long run, I don’t expect this pressured situation to continue. Earlier this year, Gilead announced positive results from a late-stage clinical trial of a . Additionally, management is looking forward to developing iterations of its HIV drug, Biktarvy. GILD could develop an injectable version of Biktarvy for patients who are resistant to the drug.If nothing else, GILD belongs on your list of stocks to buy thanks to its cash position. Even under a challenging environment, Gilead managed nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow last year. The company is more than stable enough to continue supporting its dividend yield, which currently stands at 4%.As Canada’s ,  (NYSE:) essentially has a moat. In this day and age, no one can survive without internet access. As such, BCE leverages extensive broadband and wireless networks that have a value north of $4 billion. The company’s broadband footprint extends out to 9.2 million locations, and it offers LTE wireless coverage for almost every Canadian.Source: Shutterstock
	These impressive stats finally have started to translate into market success. So far this year, BCE shares are up 21.5%.Shares have grown slowly and steadily since the beginning of the year, suggesting the worst of the volatility is behind it. Second, BCE’s revenues have steadily increased over the past three years, and we’re on pace for a fourth. Finally, BCE offers a generous 5% dividend yield, which the company can support.Last year, the telecom firm had $5.8 billion in operating cash flow, and $2.6 billion FCF. Unless Canadians suddenly stop using the internet, you can trust BCE.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable Returns@2019-10-03@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-8-best-cash-cow-stocks-to-buy-for-stable-returns-2019-10-03
(RTTNews) - Paychex Inc. (PAYX) will host a conference call at 9:30 AM ET on October 2, 2019, to discuss Q1 20 earnings results.To access the live webcast, log on to https://www.paychex.com/investors The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Q1 20 Earnings Conference Call At 9:30 AM ET @2019-10-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-q1-20-earnings-conference-call-at-9%3A30-am-et-2019-10-02
"nvestors in Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) saw new options become available this week, for the October 18th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PAYX options chain for the new October 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $78.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PAYX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $81.06/share today.

Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.50% return on the cash commitment, or 17.55% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $82.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.95.  If an investor was to purchase shares of PAYX stock at the current price level of $81.06/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $82.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.18% if the stock gets called away at the October 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PAYX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $82.50 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $82.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.41% boost of extra return to the investor, or 16.89% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $81.06) to be 19%.

"aychex’s (NASDAQ: PAYX) total revenue for fiscal 2019 (ending May) grew 12% year-over-year to $3.8 billion while adjusted EPS grew by 4% to $2.86 as the company continued to witness strong momentum in its human resource (HR) solutions administrative services and solid sales performance in professional employer organization (PEO), retirement, and insurance services. Trefis highlights the trends in over recent years in an interactive dashboard along with our forecast for fiscal 2020. We believe that Paychex’s revenues should swell by roughly $400 million over the current year primarily thanks to its acquisition of Oasis – helping the top line comfortably breach the $4-billion mark. We estimate  to be $80 per share, which is around the current market level.You can understand the revenue trends and division-wise revenue performance, and alter the assumptions to arrive at your own estimate for Paychex’s revenues in the dashboard. Additionally, you can find more .Paychex primarily has three revenue sources:How Has Paychex’s Historical Revenue Trended?

"nvestors considering a purchase of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $82.36/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $62.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.05.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.3% return against the $62.50 commitment, or a 2.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).



Selling a put does not give an investor access to PAYX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $62.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Paychex Inc sees its shares decline 24% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $60.45 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.05 from $62.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.3% annualized rate of return.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $62.50 strike is located relative to that history:
  

   
The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $62.50 strike for the 2.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Paychex Inc (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $82.36) to be 19%.

The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adage cash is king. The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call “cash cows.”While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a business’ lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. That’s why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.Another reason to look at a company’s money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options. They can choose to put money to work through key investments, or to expand operations.And if the worst happens, and the underlying industry hits a recession, cash cows can better weather the storm. Because of this dynamic, you’ll want to at least peek at the cash flow statement for your target investments.Below are the eight best cash cow stocks to buy now:I’m going to make a confession straight off the bat.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q4 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal year 2019 . At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions)It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer to begin. -- Great, thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. You can access our earnings release on the Investor Relations web page, our form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July, and this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review business highlights for the fourth quarter, Efrain we'll review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2020, and then we'll open it up for your questions.We closed fiscal 2019 with growth across our major product lines and solid progress toward our objectives. Our total revenue growth was 16% for the fourth quarter, which includes, of course, the incremental results from a Oasis Outsourcing Group. Management Solutions revenue grew 4%, while PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 67% or 10% excluding the impact of Oasis.As we look back on fiscal '19, we had a solid service and retention performance, a number of innovative enhancements to our product offerings and mobile app, and we completed the largest acquisition in our history, the acquisition of Oasis added scale to our PEO business. And we ended the fiscal year serving 1.5 million work site employees across all of our outsourcing services. In addition, we are beginning to realize the strategic benefits of the acquisition through the expansion of relationships with insurance partners and opportunities to upsell within the existing Oasis base. Our newly combined PEO leadership team continues to expand our leadership position in the HR outsourcing industry.Fiscal 2019 reflected excellent execution in client service and operations as seen in our client retention, in our client satisfaction scores. Our client retention has continued to increase from the prior year and we ended the fiscal year with payroll client retention on par with our historic best. We have made significant investments in our sales force this year, particularly in our inside sales and mid-market sales forces and in demand generation. These incremental investments are having an impact as we have experienced increased sales momentum with these efforts.In addition, we have continued to produce solid new sales growth from our share payroll, HR Solutions, retirement and PEO sales teams. The momentum in new sales coupled with improved client retention has resulted in overall growth in our payroll client base. As of May 31, 2019, we served approximately 670,000 payroll clients. In addition, excluding worksite employees acquired as part of Oasis -- the Oasis acquisition, the number of worksite employees served by our HR outsourcing services reflected double-digit growth.America's businesses are operating in challenging times. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in nearly 50 years, while employers try to ramp up their hiring. As a result, there is a lack of talent to fill open jobs, and the regulatory environment is complicated and continuously changing. State jurisdictions are continuing to advance employment-related laws and regulations that impact the hiring and employment of workers. Also, the way people work is changing, requiring employers to understand employees' workplace expectations, challenges and requirements.In this evolving landscape, businesses are looking for simple solutions that help them build their business, stay compliant, improve productivity and recruit, hire and retain talent. Paychex is uniquely positioned to meet these needs through our breadth of service offerings, but more importantly, through the combination of our innovative technology and personalized service model. This sets us apart and allows us to be true partners and advocates for our clients.We renewed our commitment to reducing the complexity for our customers related to payroll benefits and HR administration when we launched our new branding earlier this year. Our tag line, ""The Power of Simplicity"" reinforces this commitment. We continually invest in our solutions to make payroll and HR administration simpler for our clients and their employees and provide solutions the way they are working today. 70% of the usage of our 5 star mobile app is done by our clients' employees. We are making it easier for the employees and more productive for our clients through an increased number of self-service options.The enhancements we have made throughout this past year include the HR center with Performance and Learning Management and enhanced HR data analytics, benefits management enhancements with a refreshed enrollment experience for health and benefits in retirement, and increased options through the use of chatbots in artificial intelligence. All of these enhancements are designed to provide simple solutions for our clients and their employees. This focus is on steadily investing in the innovation of our Paychex Flex Human Capital Management Technology played a significant part in our recognition by NelsonHall as a leader in payroll outsourcing for the North American small business market. This was our third year in a row receiving this designation.Shifting to other solutions, we currently face a retirement crisis in the US. A recent report from the US Federal Reserve found that a quarter of Americans have no retirement savings. We recently launched enhancements through our 401(k) product design to help address this crisis by simplifying retirement plan enrollment and management. These enhancements included a new participant dashboard and added functionality in the advisor portal. The new participant dashboard makes the process of enrolling in 401(k) simpler than ever and also provides a unique combination of tools and resources to empower participants in preparing for the retirement. Our mobile app allows a new participant to enroll in as few as four clicks, which has already resulted in increased participation rates.We also continue to return value to our shareholders. In May, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 11% to $0.62 per share. During fiscal '19, we returned almost $900 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.In summary, our fourth quarter caps another successful year for Paychex. Our state-of-the-art technology, full suite of HCM product offerings and world-class personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth within our market ecosystem. Our organic business, combined with our new acquisitions have positioned us well for fiscal 2020 and beyond. The sustained efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients continue to drive the Company forward.I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Efrain? -- Thanks, Martin, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and in such involve some risks. Please refer to our earnings release for the customary disclosures. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements exclude certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2019 to their related gap measures.I'll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I'll touch briefly on full-year results and wrap with a review of the fiscal 2020 outlook. Total revenue and service revenue both grew 16% for the fourth quarter to $980 million, compared to $958 million -- I'm sorry, and $958 million respectively. Excluding Oasis, service revenue and total revenue both grew by 5%.Expenses increased 22% for the fourth quarter to $666 million. But if you exclude the Oasis acquisition, expense growth was 6%. The increase in total expenses excluding Oasis is primarily driven by increased headcount due to incremental investments in the sales force, technology resources and operations to support the growth in business. In addition, an increase in PEO insurance costs contributed approximately 1% to the growth in total expenses in the fourth quarter.Operating income increased 4% to $314 million. Operating margin was 32.1% for the fourth quarter, compared to 35.7% for the same period last year. Margins were were impacted by business mix due to the growth in PEO business, accelerated investments and sales, technology and operations, as well as some one-time acquisition, integration and amortization costs associated with the Oasis acquisition.Our effective income tax was 25.8% for the fourth quarter, compared to 28.5% for the same period last year. Net income increased 6% to $230 million, and adjusted net income increased 10% to $228 million for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.64 for the fourth quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.63.I'll not provide some additional color in selected areas. Management Solutions revenue, as you know, this includes our payroll service revenue together with other HCM products included in many of our product bundles. It increased 4% to $695 million for the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our client base across many of our services, along with growth in payroll revenue and payroll revenue per check, which increased or improved as a result of increases net of discounts. Within Management Solutions revenue, retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the number of plans served as well as an increase in revenue earned on the asset value of participants' 401(k) funds.PEO and insurances revenue, it increased 67%, as Martin mentioned, $263 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquisition of Oasis, PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased approximately 10% for the quarter. The increase was driven by growth in clients and client worksite employees across our combined PBS and HROI PEO businesses. Demand for our existing PEO services along with growth within our client base resulted in double-digit growth in the number of client worksite employees serve. Insurance service revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in the workers' comp market as we discussed last quarter.Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% for the fourth quarter to -- from 25% -- I'm sorry, 25% to $22 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients remain flat for the fourth quarter as the impact of lower client withholdings resulting from the tax reform legislation and changes in client mix were partially offset by the impact of wage inflation.Interest expense. I'll note that we had a net non-operating interest expense compared to net investment income in the prior year. This is a result of interest expense of the $800 million of debt financing that we utilized to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. The $800 million is made up of private placement debt securities with terms of seven years or 10 years with coupon rates of 4.07% to 4.25% respectively.Now, let me touch on year-to-date results quickly. Management Solutions revenue again up 4% to $2.9 billion, PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased 48% to $822 million, up (ph) 19% excluding Oasis. Interest on funds held for clients up 27% to $81 million, driven by interest rate increases and partially offset by impact of decline in average invested balances. Total revenues increased 12% to $3.8 billion, 7% growth excluding Oasis. Operating margins were 36.3%, tempered by investments in the business, the acquisition of Oasis and growth in the existing PEO direct insurance costs. Net income increased 4% and adjusted net income increased 11%. Diluted EPS increased 4% and adjusted diluted EPS also increased 11%.Turning to our investment portfolio. As you know our goal is to protect principle and optimize liquidity, we continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1% and an average duration of 2.9 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2.1% and 1.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively. These are up from 1.7% and 1.5% for the respective periods last year.Let's talk about our financial position. It remained strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of almost $800 million as of May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients, as of May 31, 2019 were $3.8 billion compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $4 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $20 million as of May 31, 2019, compared with net unrealized losses of $38 million as of May 31, 2018. The move to a net gain position was due to declines in longer term yields. Total stockholders equity was $2.6 billion as of the end of the year, reflecting $827 million in dividends paid and $57 million worth of shares repurchased during 2019. Our return on equity for the past 12 months is a very robust 42%.Cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 1% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments, partially offset by fluctuations in working capital. Working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for a combined PEO business along with higher accounts receivables related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing clients.Now, let's turn to the guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based upon current view of -- our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our Management Solutions revenue anticipated to grow 4%. PEO and insurance revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 30% to 35%, reflecting a full year of Oasis. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in a range of 4% to 8%. At this stage, we do not contemplate either any increases obviously less likely and no rate declines. We will watch and see what happens.Total revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Operating income as a percent of total revenues anticipated to be approximately 36%, comparable with this year, reflecting the expected impact of higher PEO direct insurance costs. EBITDA margin for the fiscal year 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%, again comparable to where we are -- where we end this year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million, reflecting a full year of interest on outstanding long term debt, which I discussed previously. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Net income and diluted earnings per share are both anticipated to grow approximately 8%, and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to increase in the range of 8% to 9%. And remember that we don't plan on a tax benefit when we get a stock comp exercise, which is why we adjusted it out.I will provide further color on the gating. Management Solutions revenue quarterly gating is anticipated to be consistent with the full year guidance with the exception of the first quarter, which is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%, largely due to a mix of days in the quarter. However, please note that growth rates for the PEO and insurance revenues are anticipated to be significantly higher in the first half of the fiscal year until we reach the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition. So we anticipate growth in the range of 60% to 65% in the first half of fiscal 2020, and then growth of 11% to 14% in the second half. So let me just repeat that. We anticipate growth in the range of 60% to 65% in the first half of fiscal 2020 for PEO and Insurance Services and then growth moderates to 11% to 14% in the second half after the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition.Our net income gating is also impacted by the timing of the Oasis acquisition, together with related amortization expense and integration costs. This causes lowered net income growth in the first half of the fiscal year. In addition, incremental investments in sales, technology and operations are ramped over the year during fiscal 2019. We expect net income growth to be below the full year guidance range provided at approximately 3% for the first half of the fiscal year, and then we expect it to increase to a range of 11% to 13% in the second half of the year. So let me repeat that. We expect net income growth to be below the full year guidance range for the first half of the year, and we expect it to be approximately 3% for the first half of the fiscal year, and then we expect it to increase to a range of 11% to 13% for the second half of the year due to the factors described above.And then one final point on specific to Q1. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 2%, with the most significant driver being that of investment spending funded by tax reform that was just starting to ramp up during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and incremental expenses from Oasis.So with that -- and with that color on the guidance, I will, one, refer you to our investor slides for more detail that have been posted on the web. And I will now turn the call back to Martin. -- Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we'll now open up the call for any questions, please.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask again about just your operating margin guidance. You took it down a little bit and of course, you called out higher PEO direct insurance costs. Can you again just sort of remind us what are the drivers of those higher costs? And also, are there any other secondary factors or headwinds, I know there was quite a bit of content in your remarks, can you just kind of parse out for us exactly what's happening in terms of your expectations for guidance -- for margins in this coming year? -- Hey, Ramsey. The first thing I'd say is that it wasn't a change from what we said before. We said that that operating, when you go back to Q3, we said it would be consistent with this year, which is 36%. That's what we called out this year. So I would say that with respect to your question on the margins, what we're seeing is that we by having more PEO revenue in the mix, it has a moderating impact on margins and it's offset by other efficiencies in the business, which is why even though our PEO revenues are up as a percentage of total revenues for the year, you see that the impact actually year-over-year is not significant.The other thing I would point you to is that in Q3, we said that our EBITDA margin would be comparable to our operating margin, and that's exactly what we just stated. So I think it's consistent with what we've said before. -- Fair enough. I wanted to ask you a broader kind of industry question about the PEO market in terms of further consolidation. Just in terms of the industry, do you expect that this market to kind of continue to consolidate? You've got another couple of good sized players out there, or probably a lot of smaller regional players as well, how do you see the market landscape changing? And then just a quick final bolt-on is, what interest rate assumptions are you using for your float (ph) income growth guidance? And with that, I can hop back in the queue. -- Okay. Ramsey, I think the PEO, I think you will see some further consolidation I think, as it becomes more competitive, you need to have the breadth of services and the relationships with the carriers to offer the best, both combination of product and service, the best technology from a mobile standpoint as well for the enrollment of the benefits. And you've got to have the experience to handle some of the pretty rapidly changing requirements from the state side and from the carriers, and what the new insurance plans are, what the new rules are, and the HR piece of it is becoming even more important many times than the benefits themselves. So I think smaller players will find it continue -- will continue to find it difficult to provide and compete in this environment. And certainly with our acquisition of Oasis, there's been a lot, even more interest, I think, in the consolidation and the growth in that market, which continues to grow very strong across the board. As I noted and Efrain mentioned, I think as well, our growth in worksite employees was double digits even without the Oasis acquisition. So we're very proud of the sales and the service that we're providing in the PEO market. And I'll turn it back to Efrain on the interest rate assumptions. -- Yes. So Ramsey, in my comments, I mentioned in the fourth quarter our combined portfolios were 2.1%. You can see for the year, we were 1.9% for the full year. So I would expect that when you look at the full year impact, we're going to tick up slightly from where we are in fourth quarter. We'll have a little bit of benefit from balances that should be a bit higher than what we had this year. But it's modest, you can see in the guidance of 4% to 8% increase on interest on funds held for clients. We're being somewhat cautious on what we expect in terms of the portfolio. -- That's perfect. Thanks so much.Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I may have missed the exact client count growth that you just called out in your prepared remarks. Can you maybe talk about within segments small -- micro, small and mid-market, kind of where do you see growth (inaudible) for payroll? -- I think it's either on -- I think it's on -- in the press release and it's on our investor slide. So we ended the year at about 670,000 clients. Last year, we disclosed 650,000. We saw growth -- we saw a lot of growth in the SMB segment of the market.Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. -- Hey, good morning, guys. -- Hi, Jason. -- Good morning, Jason. -- I just want to start with the question on core payroll revenue growth and thank you for the final quarter disclosure on that metric. I think it did slow a tick, a point down to 2% in Q4 and came in, I guess, 2% rounded for the full year. Was that effectively all pricing? And then would you expect to get a similar amount of pricing in fiscal '20? -- Jason, I don't think it's slowed. I think what you're -- what you -- what you're seeing is that we anniversaried the acquisition of Lessor last year. So Q3 was a tick higher and it is very difficult, I would caution, to compare Q3 to Q4 now, because Q3 has certain kinds of revenue that only recur -- only occur in that quarter. So I think we ended up, we were pleased with where we ended up. We had client growth. We certainly saw some really robust results in parts of the market. Our internal sales were very good. Shared payroll was incredible, really strong year. And we are positioned really well from a digital marketing standpoint and from an internal sales standpoint. So we feel really good about where we're exiting the year and obviously, we had client growth, which is the ultimate indicator of that. -- And just anything on the pricing? -- Look, pricing is a part of -- it's a part of the equation. So we would expect certainly that we can continue to get price and have never have an issue. -- Yeah, we've had -- especially, when you think about the client retention that is historic highs, we think the pricing has stopped very well. And we've been able to sell the value of not only the technology and that we've been introducing in the mobile app and so forth, but the service as well. So I think, still having the pricing in the same range we've been in the past, it should absolutely be doable and we should be able to retain and hold that pricing as well. -- Okay. Understood. And just want to make sure I heard the comments properly around the float income forecast. I think you indicated you're not assuming any changes in Fed funds. I mean, obviously the market is pricing in a high probability of that next month. So I just wanted to make sure that you still got the rule of thumb right on that if I recall, a 25 basis point change in Fed funds is roughly a 1% or so of net income. Does that still hold? -- 25 bps, no, it's not correct. So it's about a 25 bps drop would result between in a impact of about $3 million to $4 million. So I haven't done the -- maybe that creates the 1%, but I would caution a little bit about that, because one of the things that we looked at when we looked at the guidance was, we have ways to adjust the duration of the portfolio to deal with changes -- modest changes or declines during the year. So I wouldn't necessarily take that to the bank because we do have some things we can do if we see some modest decreases during the year. -- Okay. -- That's why we are conservative on the range we provided. -- Okay. And then just last one kind of on the macro front, I know you guys obviously have no client concentration, but just wanted to see if we can get an update on which parts of the economy these days you're most exposed to, construction, manufacturing, service industries, restaurants, whatever it may be just as people contemplate where the US economy may be heading in the next 12 to 18 months, how we should be thinking about Paychex's exposures? -- Yes, I think we're pretty well spread across all of the different sectors. And I think we're seeing any big change in any of those on our small business index that we put out for our clients under 50. We're seeing kind of all sectors kind of hanging in there at the same manufacturing has been down, but it's about the same. And I would say there's still the strongest from an index perspective is those other services, discretionary services and those type of things that we're pretty heavy and so I would think that they're still doing pretty well. And they're still -- they're not necessarily growing, but they're growing at a slower rate than they have in the past. But they're still growing.And I think the thing would be to watch some of the minimum wage increases and has that done anything? We haven't seen a big impact from those at this point. And instead, we're seeing sometimes more hours worked in general for those jobs. So I would say, we're pretty spread out and we don't see any major concern at this point. We're not seeing any signs of necessarily a slowdown. Still growth, a little slower growth than in the past. But that was some of the recovery as well. -- All right. Okay, great color. Thanks, guys. -- Sure.Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Wolfe Research. -- Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing for bookings on the PEO side, is still trending low double digits, low teens like you were last quarter. Any change in cadence there? And could you walk us through the workers' comp-related impacts going forward and just how you're thinking about that in the quarters ahead? -- I would say on the PEO side, both existing client growth and worksite employees and the new sales have been very strong. As I mentioned, we're double-digit without the Oasis acquisition. And of course, with that even stronger in the double-digit side. So we're showing very good strength in worksite employees. We now, across PEO, ASO, all of our products, we serve more worksite employees than anyone else. And we're showing great solid growth there. As I mentioned, the need for HR and the benefits is so much -- so significant these days with the unemployment rate so low, particularly for small- and mid-sized businesses. If they're going to attract and retain people, they really need the benefit of good benefit plans and good HR, which includes training and developing their people, data analytics, all the things that we're providing now, learning management systems that give them free training, modules that they can use or develop their own. So I think we're going to see continued good strong growth in the PEO side in particular, and of course, our ASO side as well, if they don't necessarily want the PEO or don't qualify under underwriting, we take them through the insurance agency of which we're the 20th largest in the country. And that gives us a great out that even many other PEO competitors do not have in their favor. Do you want to talk about workers? -- Yeah. So just to add some color on that, James, the two of the strongest quarters from a bookings perspective in the entire company were PEO, which was very strong and then mid-market, which was very strong too. So we had two parts of the business that had very, very strong growth from a bookings perspective. On the workers comp side, it was as we quoted, a soft quarter. We think that's going to persist for at least two or three quarters that's built into our guidance. Rates have softened pretty significantly.It tempers the growth of PEO. You can't see it as much because our PEO growth in the fourth quarter organically was in the upper teens. And so it's tempered a bit by the cyclical nature of the workers' comp market, which currently is soft. But we will see where we end up at the beginning of next year. So there's a couple things that mask what is very, very strong performance on the PEO side, and we were very heartened also by strong performance in mid-market HCM. -- That's good to hear. Just two more quick things I wanted to touch on something that you guys mentioned, you talked about SurePayroll. Briefly, you're saying, you had a great year there and you expect it to do well going forward. I think, could you just expand on that a little bit?And then secondly, the duration comment you made, I think your portfolio is around like 3.1 years or so. What can you bring that to and how would that impact $3 million to $4 million you referenced? How should -- just a little more color on how we should think about that? -- Yeah, I'll lead with the SurePayroll. Yeah, they -- I think we have really mastered the handle on demand generation. We've put a lot of investment in that from both shared payroll and Flex -- and Paychex Flex, and I think we've really done a great job as far as the investments in improving demand generation and nurturing meaning, including nurturing leads that were weaker leads in the past that we may have lost because we did -- they didn't. We're ready to buy it, but we've got a quite complex nurturing process now where we can reach out and continue to build the leads and get them when they're ready.Shared payroll, I think has been not only priced effectively, but also through the demand generation getting a lot more leads and being able to close them and also allowing some self-service options. So allowing clients to kind of on board themselves if they wish, which was a lot more self-service options that prospects want now, they can go in, they can start if they need help or jump in and help them. But that whole self-service part of it is also another way of capturing a lead that was looking to get started right away. It may have been difficult to reach if we call them back. So the whole change, the number of changes we've made in demand generation and handling a telephonic sales both here at Paychex and through shared payroll have been very strong and we expect that growth to continue. I think the product, the service and the positioning of how we sell online and telephonically has become much stronger this year. Efrain, you want to take the... -- Yes, you're right, Jim. So the duration portfolio is in the low 3s. We could stretch that up to about 3.75 years of duration if we wanted to. We're obviously playing a number of those different variables across different scenarios. So that's why I think in response to Jason's question, actually maybe Ramsey and Jason's question, what we feel comfortable with is by setting the range where we are, we will just see where the Fed ends up from a rate perspective and then we can adjust the portfolio accordingly. So not have a major impact. -- Okay. Great. Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, guys, good morning. Just a couple of clarifications. On that payroll client growth of 3%, was that in line with expectations and how how is that tracking historically and should we just kind of model that same amount of growth going forward? -- Every year is a little bit different, Bryan. So I would say that -- what we say is that we expect payroll client growth to be in the 1% to 3% range. Last year, we didn't hit that target. This year, we were solidly within that. I would say that going forward, we expect to be within that range. -- Okay. Helpful. And then thinking about the PEO insurance revenue growth, I know in the back half we're talking about 11% to 14% growth. I'm guessing the fourth quarter will be the strongest quarter, though as some of the worker comp issues lap. And then what kind of growth rate should be a more normalized growth rate there once we get through the worker comp issue? -- I'm going to hold off -- I'm going to hold off talking about it specifically, because there's -- by the time we get to Q4, there'll be lots of specific issues that are going to affect -- could affect that growth number. So I'll hold off. I think what we're comfortable with is saying where we are at the second half, we'll update as we go through the year. -- But there -- but the drag -- the primary -- primarily the drag out there in kind of the second half is that worker's comp growth rate or just any other puts and takes. I know the business obviously outperformed, grown 18%. I think it was 18% to 20% was the guide for fiscal year '19 originally. And then now that's a little bit of a lower growth rate ex that. So just trying to make that delta change. -- So I get where you're going. I guess, Brian, what I'd say is that we should have anniversaried a lot of the impacts by fourth quarter, but I have no idea what the growth rate than the existing growth rate will be in at that point -- in market growth rate, I should say not ours. I know exactly what ours is. So I can't call that. I can't call that specifically. I think the fourth quarter will depend in large measure on how strong we exit the year -- next year with PEO with Oasis in the fall. So I think it's going to depend on that and also where we are with the workers' comp market. So there's still miles and miles to go before we get to Q4 of next year. But those will be the factors that will drive Q4 growth. -- Okay. I got it. Just last question (technical difficulty) seems like that continues to move and improve. How much room is there still to go that you can improve client retention? -- Hey Brian, you cut out just at the very beginning of that. Could you just say that again? I didn't hear it all. -- Yeah, I just was asking about client retention. That seems like it's continued to improve and move in the right direction. Just trying to figure out how much more room is there for that to improve as you guys go forward here? -- Okay. Yeah, I think we're very pleased with what we've done. We're at historic highs, so we'll always try to make that a little bit stronger. I think we're finding ways to service clients as they -- differently now as they want to be serviced a little bit differently. It's not all, it's probably half of them that want that necessarily telephonic payroll, dedicated payroll specialist. So many more are calling in, so many more are using the app, the chatbots and the -- that we're doing for self service. So it's putting us in a place that we haven't been before that could drive a little bit of more improvement. But given the number of losses in small business, which is still a large majority of the clients, I'd have to say -- I'd like to -- I do see some improvement, but it probably has some top level it can get to when you just have a large number, half of them or more, a little bit more than that or just out of business. So it'll depend a little bit on, obviously, the economy as well. But those leaving for a service, price and those things, I think can still get a little bit more of an improvement out of it. -- Okay. Helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. -- Thanks so much. Just had a couple of modeling related questions. I know you typically don't guide to free cash flow. Is there anything going on differently next year or should we just kind of assume this typical conversion rate from EBITDA? -- I think it's probably typical. Jeff, we also gave, I think in the investor slides, we give you an update on the D&A for next year versus this year, so you can calculate the incremental amount. I know you're big on those two numbers. So as -- and they're important. So they're in the slides there. But there should be no significant changes in terms of conversion. -- All right. Great. You caught me on that, Efrain. Thanks. -- All right. You caught me, so. -- No worries. And then also just a minor one. You gave us some color on the cadence quarterly. I do appreciate that. Is there any specific impact from a margin perspective quarterly and also from a tax perspective quarterly? -- Well, I mean, from a net perspective there's some impact. You can -- when you walk through the model of what I said, where the first half is 3% and I call that Q1 1% to 2%, and then in the back half. So from a net perspective, obviously in the back half, what you're seeing is higher margins. But part of it is too that partly due to ASC 606, we have more -- we're more heavily back-half weighted than we used to be before. And so if you look at our expenses and and you assume that there's not big changes quarter-over-quarter in our expenses, what you see is that the flow through of the incremental revenue drives higher income in the back half of the year. That's what you're seeing. -- Okay, that's actually helpful. Thank you so much.Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. -- Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. How are you? -- Good. How are you doing? -- Good. Hey, Marty, I wanted to ask a little bit about the PEO business and Oasis. You talked about investment both in sales and technology. And I'm wondering what kind of growth you are anticipating next year for the Oasis sales force? And just from a technology standpoint, is that just that you are going to have a more robust mobile offering? Or are there other investments that you're making in the business? -- Yes, I think, kartik, what you'll see and we've already been doing some of this is linking them to our products. So Oasis already now is linked to our time and attendance product are linked better to our interfacing with our 401(k) and our retirement services product. These are things that sales force has not had before. They also have the opportunity to use our insurance agency, which they didn't have before. So if they didn't -- as a PEO, the underwriting didn't fit primarily. They couldn't necessarily take them for insurance -- for the insurance products and now they can run those through our insurance agency. We're just kind of working through all of the sales teams, but we have all of the leadership team now in place for a number of months for probably a quarter, and they're working through combining all of the sales processes and compensation plans and directions. And so they'll have more products to offer. They'll have insurance -- the insurance agencies to support them. And they'll certainly have all of the tools with sales force and the level of technology that we use for our sales teams to track the leads and referrals, et cetera. So we're feeling that we're pretty solid coming into this fiscal year as we start this month with Oasis and our PEO teams really combine -- and underwriting as well, all kind of combined and streamlined. So that they're going to have a lot more to offer. -- And then Martin, I think you talked about maybe changing of how you're obtaining clients in the sense that I don't know if you use this word or not, but inside sales and has that figures how has over the last six to 12 months changed as to how you're obtaining clients versus just the sales force that knocks on doors versus somebody that's inside? -- Yes, the inside sales are telephonic sales. Here from Paychex standpoint, has continued to increase their production, their double-digit growth over last year. We're also introducing and trialing some self-service and really through shared payroll who has had that now for most of this year now. You're seeing that when the leads come in and they can either be addressed immediately by either the field or telephonically depending kind of on the size and what they're looking for. If they're directly referred to by a CPA, who is tied to our field sales rep -- we'll get them right to the field sales rep immediately and we'll address it.If they'd rather just deal with something on the phone do a demo over online and then close on the sale right there and have it implemented, we'll do that. And now, we're moving -- you're going to see us moving toward a self-service option as well that your payroll has and has been working very effectively. One of the biggest issues with telephonic sales and leads, frankly, coming in, is that once you have the lead where someone's been interested, they fill out a form. You can't get back a hold of the prospect, because nobody answers their phone anymore. So what we're doing is we're -- by allowing self service where the client can actually get started and set themselves up if they have an issue, then we can talk to them. But they've already started by almost completing the sale, by starting to setup themselves, which they'd like to do immediately.So that has also really turned out very well for us. And we're seeing a lot of good leads there for sure. The field is still very important to us, particularly from a channel development, we still continue to be a leader, I think, in the CPA referral market in current client referrals, and that's done very strongly by the field and they'll continue to concentrate on that. But as more of the small -- the brand new businesses start up and they come in through the web, the deal is how fast can you handle them. And they're certainly fine with handling it over the phone or setting it up themselves. -- And then just one last question, Efrain. Obviously, your balance sheet, you know, if other acquisition opportunity happen to come up, how -- what's the comfort level in terms of leverage for the Company today? -- Well, Kartik, right now, we end the year, we're at zero net debt. So we certainly have the ability to get more leverage or be more leveraged if we want to. Yes, I don't think there's a specific number. We're going to be conservative about it. Obviously, a turn and a half of EBITDA that starts to get little bit higher than -- a little bit higher in the range. Would we go higher? It would really depend on whether we thought an acquisition was strategic or not. So I think it depends on the opportunity. Oasis, we used cash on hand, we borrowed $800 million. Oasis is going to be cash accretive. We have the capability doing the right kind of targeted acquisitions to be more acquisitive, and it will depend on whether what's the size of the acquisition and how strategic the opportunity is. -- Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate it. -- Okay. Thanks Kartik.Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. -- Good morning. Thank you. Sort of go back to the growth of the PEO, but I guess I'm just having a little trouble following the math. So perhaps you can go back and reconcile your organic growth of PEO in the fourth quarter, which I think you said was about 10%, with the high-teens growth for the year and then the guide to 11% to 14% in the back half of the year, next year, which presumably is an organic number, when you lap the comparison. I know workers' comp is a little bit of that. So if you could just maybe deconstruct that for us? -- So now you started with a faulty premise. You said that that PEO was 10%. PEO is not 10%, PEO and insurance was 10% in the quarter. PEO as I mentioned it before, if we isolated was upper teens, number one. Worksite growth -- worksite employee growth was again double digit. We didn't disclose an exact number, but you can see from the growth in worksite employees that Marty cited, we're up to 1.5 million of worksite employees serviced across our ASO and our PEO that we had a nice growth.So we had really good bookings growth organically on the PEO. The PEO at the end of the year organically was growing in the upper teens. And then in the back half of next year, we're calling up 11% to 14%. Once we anniversary Oasis and what's going on there is that there's a drag from workers' comp that's impacting that number. So if there were no workers' comp, the number would be higher based on where we anticipate things will be as we get to the third and fourth quarter of next year. So hopefully that... -- So you are -- right, so I'm sorry. So you are high-teens PEO growth in the fourth quarter and you are high-teens for the year. Is that it? -- Yes, I think it's called out, either in one of the slides or in -- I quoted out in my comments, but our PEO growth for the year was 19%. -- Got it. Got it. Sorry about that. Thank you for that clarification. -- I have to say, it's always important to remember that PEO and insurance has the Paychex Insurance Agency and we're battling a bit of a drag on the workers' comp side that we will battle into next year. But we're obviously showing some pretty good underlying growth. -- Right. Right. And then just there was a comment, I think, Marty, you made about the integration with the carriers as it relates to Oasis. So perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on kind of where you are in that process and how much incremental geographic reach you're getting as a result of that as you try to convert the payroll install base? -- Sure, David. There's really two pieces of that. Well, first of all, say, we're in -- I think we're in good shape. We're in the middle of that now. But we've been already working through it and particularly the last few months. So one, there is geographic growth because they were in some states and areas that we weren't. So they had relationships there and already had some clients that we could gain referrals from.From the carriers, they were stronger with one particular carrier that we have not been quite as strong with that gave us a little bit more leverage. When you put all those together, now we have more strength and more clout with all the carriers that we're involved with. So we think we've got very good plans between the two of us going forward into fiscal '20, and those were allowed kind of through the year. And so that gives us a better -- also, when you have more clout I guess, or more clients, obviously, we will have better integration with those carriers as well. So I think we're set up well with the number of carriers, the plans and the integration with them. So it's going to give us an expansion into a little more -- a few more states that we're not in, but better than that, a little bit stronger carrier relations for the best benefit plans, which is one of the most important things to have as you go out and compete. -- Right. So, as you look at kind of the geographic template with Oasis, do you think you've got pretty much solid coverage across the overlap with your installed base of payroll customers? -- Yes, we certainly do. Particularly, I wouldn't say it covers the whole map by any means, but it covers those states that particularly have an interest in PEO, I mean, just the Georgia, Florida, Texas, California kind of thing. It's going into more states as we expanded, but it definitely picked up. I think they were in 14 different states. So we definitely picked up more states and where there is more interest in PEO sort of expanded where we were from that standpoint. And again, as I mentioned earlier, we're already integrating them with some of our products that they didn't have to offer as well. So not only do you get clout with the carriers and the benefit plans that they can offer, but also now they can more easily sell time and attendance that's integrated -- 401(k) that's integrated and they have our insurance agency to back them up if there is a client we don't want to underwrite. -- Hey, David, one other thing I would say, I want to make sure that it's not implicit in the assumption in your question. PEO is probably is unique among the products that we sell and that a significant amount of the sales come from outside the Paychex client base. So if you take HROI and Oasis, you now have access to clients that are outside of the Paychex's, traditional base -- client base. So our expectations about growth in PEO are not solely based on the upsell of existing Paychex clients. They're based on going out and getting new -- brand new to Paychex's clients in PEO. So it's a mixture of both. So when we talk about geographic coverage, not just the base, it's also being In those geographies in a more concentrated way. -- Okay. Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. -- Okay, Dave.Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. -- Hi, good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the investment-focused areas for 2020? I mean, you've had terrific success now with the digital marketing initiatives -- sales initiatives, et cetera, you got client base retention up. As you're looking out to 2020, what's the next wave of investment areas? -- Yes, I think it continues to be in the innovation of the products and adding every -- about every six weeks, we're adding additional feature and functionality to the payroll products and particularly the HR side of the business, whether it's learning management, whether it's a partnership with -- let me stick with the products first. Second, I want to go to partnership. But with the products like learning management, data analytics, I think you'll see also we're continuing to invest in the chatbot and artificial intelligence that we're using. We're seeing that to be a big help from the service perspective and also on the mobile app.So we're continuing to make things simple for clients and their employees. 70% of our mobile app usage is employees of our clients. And what we're finding is things like when we make it easy to enroll in 401(k), with they can do it in four clicks now versus the paperwork and the passing of the paperwork for the client and to watch and back and forth, that participant rate is already going up and those who are signing up for the 401(k) that leads to better client retention, because they now pass all the compliance tests and they have --their employees that are happy with their retirement plans and gives them better retention.So the investment will be to continue to make things simple from the mobile app side, from the client employee side. Self service is going to be -- it just continues to be very important, right from initially signing up, right through to setting up everything for yourself. There's a whole wave these days of clients and their employees wanting to do things themselves when they want to do it. So you've got to make everything simple.Luckily, our investments very long ago started to be our development was mobile first, meaning everything is made, designed simple for the mobile app and then can expand for your desktop as you need it. So a big thing there. Partnerships will be, again, for we have the only large partnership that's been announced with Indeed, we are out there providing a connection directly to flex with basically the push of a tile or a button that will get you to Indeed and help you post a job critically important right now in this low unemployment area. These are partnerships that we haven't necessarily done before, and we're being much more aggressive in trying to partner with what the needs of the client have been. So we're very pleased with the investments in artificial intelligence in chatbots, what that also I did't mentioned has done for service. Now we're taking -- I mean, 60% of these service requests coming in on a chatbot are handled by that -- or coming in online are being handled by that chatbot, that's freeing up our personnel for much more complicated questions and for more clients that they can handle. So it's really helping us from a service perspective as well. -- Terrific, thank you. Efrain, I have a just a follow-up, sort of back to basics question on the PEO and ASO business, because you've mentioned a few times now your insurance agency. Can you just remind us when and what types of clients you will take on the underlying actuarial risk? And then I guess I always felt that you would reinsure that. So can you just clarify sort of in what situations does a client end up entering the PEO versus end up using your insurance agency potentially? And like what differentiates those two and sort of how does that impact you or your economics? -- Yes. So just the the 120 second fly over on worker's comp, I'm going to say between 60% and 65% of all clients of PEO end up being underwritten by Paychex. And then we set reserves and have reinsurance above certain levels have been doing that for more than two decades without any issues when we look at that very, very closely. So then you say, what happens with the other third? Well, there are certain funds that you don't want to underwrite workers' comp or we have the unique advantage of having a insurance agency right next door. So we will have -- we will place those clients with Paychex Insurance Agency, and one of the things that we've found this year that was really a help was that by creating more of a tight linkage between the PEO and the insurance agency, it's now much more seamless to say to a client that otherwise we would not do workers' comp for to simply refer them to the agency to see if they can get a policy place, that's been a big plus and a big hit with our sales force too.On the healthcare side, it's primarily a state of Florida issue, there's a little bit of other risk we take. And that's just a function of the concentration of clients that we have in Florida. We have an MPP plan. We do insurance with the Blues of Florida that gives access to a much broader network -- to a broader network of healthcare providers. And again, we look at the projected MLRs or medical loss ratios for the pool. We just reserve it appropriately and above a certain amount we reinsure that risk. So that's basically what we're doing. More limited risk taking on the healthcare side, we take some risk on workers' comp, reinsure it and then are very strict about who we let into the pool in either case. And where for other clients -- by the way, I said workers' comp in terms of insurance referrals. We also refer for healthcare to our agencies. So we've got flexibility and this helps us kind of protect the quality of the pool and workers' comp and in healthcare. -- Terrific. Thank you. Super helpful.Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. -- Great, thanks. Hey, so I know you mentioned a couple of times on the retention that you're bumping up against historical levels. But if you think about the investments you've made, the kind of diversification into PEO, is it -- what's the probability we enter a new range on that? And I guess, Marty, can you remind us kind of where we are, where that number is today and if it is in fact the case, so we can kind of reset that range? What's a better way to think about that? And then just what's the sensitivity to 100 basis points in terms of revenue? -- Yeah. I'll start with it. It's a little stronger than 82% on the client retention, the way we look at it. I think it's a little bit better than that from a revenue perspective where we don't typically give that, but it's better than that. So our historic high has been right around that 82%. Now when you think about, as I said, Kevin, earlier, when you think about losses for the small business side, it's pretty tough to get a lot better than that, because small businesses just start up and go out of business. And obviously we've been able to handle that very effectively and profitably. But, I think, we'll look through the investments that I just talked about and Lisa's question, when you think about the investments in chatbots and artificial intelligence and responding to clients even quicker is there something there, not to mention we've done a lot of investment in data analytics and knowing models of which clients are most likely to leave us. And then we approach them kind of proactively through a retention team. I think all of those have that in the great service, which we are at historic highs for our net promoter score as well. I think we're all benefiting that getting us to the best.So do I think we can do a little bit better than that? I think so, but I just think it does have a top limit because of just the number of auto businesses that happen in the small business market. -- Understood. And then just real quick, I know obviously we've taken about 200 basis points of investment, put it back into the business, but you've shifted a lot of that capacity to cloud. So just trying to get a sense where are we in that cloud evolution, number one? And then just obviously there's certain amount of margin benefit from that as well, I guess twofold. When did some of those investments run off? And then what's the uplift on the margin as the capacity is done through the cloud as opposed to the traditional service? -- Yeah, I think, pretty much you can say everything is pretty much in the cloud now that the way the clients approach us and where our services are. I mean, everything is software-as-a-service and everything is built as I said, mobile-first, everything is available that way. I think some of the additional investments that we've made and talked about will start to run off at the end of this year. We made an investment and a very deliberate investment to speed up some of the product development that we could see ourselves doing in the future and set to take advantage of the tax savings to instead of just run it all to the bottom line in a one-time kind of fashion. Hey, let's put some of this to accelerate the product development, we've been very happy with that.Obviously, it's driven the best client satisfaction and retention scores, its improved our sales. Overall our par growth is the best it's been in three years from a sales perspective. So we're feeling like the right investments were put in place for sales, for telephonic sales, for demand generation through marketing and through IT. But some of that, through the IT, will start to come off toward the back of the year. I don't think we've given, hey, what that will do necessarily to margins or probably will, but -- at this point. But it will roll off, some of that will go back down to a little bit less investment -- normalized investment toward the end of this fiscal year. -- Yeah. Hey, Kevin, one other thing I'd say to answer that question qualitatively, as Marty said, the investments start to roll off as we exit this year, which is what we had said before. At that point, in the absence of any change in the mix of the business, you would expect operating margins now to start to float back up. The only caveat that I've said when I get asked on that question is what is the growth of the PEO? Because the PEO has a moderating impact on margins. Now the offset to that would be faster revenue growth potentially. But I would say as we go through the year, we'll have better sense of kind of what the overall margin uplift. Underlying margin uplift, excluding PEO, is going to go up. PEO will have an impact though overall depending on mix. -- Got it. And then, Efrain, if I could real quick, are you kind of where you are from a headcount perspective? Or would there be some more optimization based on kind of how the capacity sits? -- You mean just in in general, or are you specific to anything? -- I would say just the -- either, either. However, you want to answer that. -- I mean, I think look, we're always, we've got a history of being very profitable and making sure that we keep our cost below. I think we continue to always look for leverage. As Efrain said, the change in the margins have been mostly because of the PEO business and the way that that hit your financials drives a lot of revenue, but also has higher expenses and brings the kind of margin percent down. But I think we're always looking for ways to continue to leverage and I think the investments we've made. But again, back to when you think about artificial intelligence and chatbots and so forth, answering 60%, 70% of the questions, we certainly are looking to continue to drive some headcount down where it's not needed.But we've also been very good at then reinvesting that headcount where it is needed. So for years, we've taken headcount out of operations where we've got more efficient and put it into technology where we knew the market was going. So I'm not sure headcount itself, it'll all depend on where the growth is. And of course, we've grown the headcount really because of the growth in the business, not necessarily. We haven't -- we've never really deleveraged from a headcount perspective. In my, at least 15 years, we've always drove -- driven headcount down, but may have invested that somewhere else. -- Awesome. Thank you all.Your next question comes line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. -- Hey, good morning. Just a quick question on retention. You had a lot of good questions there already, but just on Oasis specifically, are you -- do you have pretty good line of sight now on the retention there in the initial period? I can't remember if you said that there's an opportunity to maybe improve retention there once you apply the -- maybe the Paychex way there or not? -- No, we really haven't broken that out. I think we have a pretty good line of sight that it's been pretty solid. We had no surprises what so ever, which is always good, on an acquisition. I think they've done a good job on the service side and selling to the right clients. We have not seen any fallout from insurance plan, changes or anything else at this point. So I think the retention has been solid. And there's always -- we're always looking for ways to improve it, but we certainly did not have any surprises and we're very satisfied with where they are and retention. -- Fair enough. Thank you. -- Okay, thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Marty, based on your commentary, it looks like retention is up 100 basis points, it was 81% in last year's 10-K, and you mentioned it's over 82% this fiscal year that just ended. So I'm curious, what did gross new customer adds grow in fiscal '19 versus fiscal '18? I'm just trying to parse how much of that 3.1% total customer growth was driven by the improvement in gross retention versus new customer adds? -- Yes, it's a mix of both, we don't break it out and we don't give that level of detail. But the -- certainly, the overall growth of clients was a benefit of both good sales results and a little bit better retention. Just that improvement in retention alone, on the payroll side, would not have made that total difference there. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. -- Okay.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. -- Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Hey, I was wondering, you mentioned that in the mid-market, you ended up seeing good growth. And I'm wondering specifically, were there some new additions to the overall bundle that's driving that? Where -- what's the primary driver do you think of the improvement there? And I'll leave it there for now. -- I think a couple of things. One, I think, certainly, the product adjustments that were the product enhancements that we've made, so adding data analytics, adding a new HR center, what we call HR center, gives you performance management support, also the -- I didn't mention, the learning management. So everything that is needed this year from a recruiting, training, and the personnel development that clients have been looking for, prospects are looking for, we have added and made it much stronger. And so I think from a product set that's very good. From a sales perspective, I think the approach of going totally with HR and the HR need is been very strong as well.So I think that the approach of selling HR and approaching the client from their total HR needs has been strong and sales are up, probably the best growth we've seen again in three years in the mid-market. And we seem to be on a good path to start the new fiscal year as well. -- That's great. And then any change in terms of the profile of those mid-market clients in terms of who you're winning them from or what sort of systems they had in place previously? -- No, I don't think so. I think from any of the competitors, I think we're doing pretty well, it's been pretty consistent. I think we're obviously winning a few more, I think, than we were and I think that's again the sales execution is stronger, the sales training is stronger and the product itself is stronger. So we're pretty pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the mid-market. And I wouldn't say it's from any one competitor, I think we're doing pretty well against all of them when you compare it historically. -- Great. And then with regards to the improvements that you've made, it's been a very short period of time that you've already ramped up in terms of the chatbots and the ability to answer questions, and you're getting the 60% to 70% of them now. Where do you think that goes in a couple of years? -- See as I think -- I mean based on the improvements so far, what I read when you research this kind of -- around the country, I would think you could get up to 75%, maybe even 80%. And it's so easy, well, I think it's easy, but our development team might not. It's so -- you can be so responsive to the feedback of seeing if the question was answered or not that you get so much better about refining the questions that they're out -- being able to read the questions they are asking and respond to that. But I definitely think it could get up into those 75% range any way, maybe even 80%. -- And you're directly tying the improvement in terms of a client retention, and the client satisfaction scores to people who utilize the chatbot or being serviced by it? -- I wouldn't say that directly yet. I don't have it that specific, but I think it certainly is part of it. And we really ramped that up this year. And obviously we've seen good satisfaction and we get good results. We always ask the client after they've received their answers, did this satisfy? What you were looking for? And we're getting very good feedback on that and very good results. So it certainly, I think, has helped in the client satisfaction. But I think primarily that satisfaction has been on the product, the ability of the product to serve the client, the ease of use of the product and the great service, a personalized service that we're providing. -- Great. And then with regards to the self implementation on the small end, I know it's really early days, but are you seeing any sort of -- maybe too early to tell. But is there any difference in terms of the client retention level that you see from clients that are willing to self implement? -- I think it's a little early to really have an update there. But, what you do see is typically clients who set themselves up historically, even in a small sample are more likely to be retained because they feel like it was their fault that there was a problem, because they set themselves up. And therefore they own it a little bit more and they're a little more tolerant of giving us a chance to help fix the issue that they may have created. -- Got it. Great. And then lastly, just workers' comp for next year and how we should think about Insurance Services? I'm not talking about the next fiscal year beyond the one that you've already guided for, but for the second half, when we go into the new calendar year, are you assuming that workers' comp rates are going to be down 15% to 25% in terms of your overall assumption? And then within PEO and insurance, what are you expecting the insurance part to be down? -- Okay, so that's a compound question, got two pieces to it. So let me just (inaudible). So with respect to workers' comp, the workers' comp I'm talking about is not workers' comp that has anything to do with the PEO. So before that, pick that out of your mind. This is... -- Got that out of my mind. -- Yes, it's purely the workers' comp -- yes, Paychex workers' comp. So I would say, Mark, I don't know in the back half specifically how much we have it down. But certainly in the first half where we declined pretty significantly versus first half of last year and then it starts to moderate -- that decline starts to moderate in the back half of the year because we started to experience the declines in workers' comp heavily in third and fourth quarter. So I think it moderates as we go through the year. I would not expect to be 15% to 20% down in the fourth quarter, again, that's way too much. -- Okay. -- I would think we're getting closer to kind of flat or maybe slightly above by the time we get to Q4, just because we're anniversarying some sharp declines in the back half of the year. -- And then this for the Insurance Services revenue? -- Insurance in total, no, because health and benefits is growing nicely, actually had a good quarter revenue wise for health and benefits. This is again, health insurance and support to Paychex clients that's growing nicely at upper single digits. And we'd expect that to continue to grow nicely through the balance of the year. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- Thanks, Mark.Your final question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. -- Yea, hi. Good morning. It's Steven Wald on for James. Just maybe one quick one following up on the margin discussion, I think you said, all as equal past sort of 2020 results of the Oasis expect the margin to sort of float up. I think on the last call, you have talked about expecting year-over-year EBITDA margin improvement in 2021. If you could speak to whether that's still your expectation? And also, give me sort of -- if the OK times or good times whatever you want to call it continue, what the sort of upper limit is on the EBITDA or operating margin? -- Yes, I'll answer the first and can't answer yet the second. I think we need to have a full year of Oasis under our belt, understand what the behavior of costs is in the business. We understand what it will be in '21. We would expect EBITDA margin to float up in '21. There's many reasons for that. But I think that we should see some improvement on EBITDA margin. What is the feeling of that a little bit early to say at this point. We'll have a better sense if we go through the year. -- Okay. Thanks. -- Okay.Thank you, and I'll now turn the call to Mr. Mucci for any additional or closing remarks. -- Thank you. And at this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our fourth quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.Thank you. That does conclude the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 7/31/19, Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.62, payable on 8/22/19.  As a percentage of PAYX's recent stock price of $86.45, this dividend works out to approximately 0.72%, so look for shares of Paychex Inc to trade 0.72% lower — all else being equal — when PAYX shares open for trading on 7/31/19.


   
In general, dividends are not always predictable; but looking at the history above can help in judging whether the most recent dividend from PAYX is likely to continue, and whether the current estimated yield of 2.87% on annualized basis is a reasonable expectation of annual yield going forward.

The chart below shows the one year performance of PAYX shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
   

   

Looking at the chart above, PAYX's low point in its 52 week range is $61.32 per share, with $88.43 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $86.47.

Although the odds favored a bullish outcome despite the trajectory, it was clear that anything could happen. Waiting on one side or the other to flinch was the key.We’re still waiting. Although ABBV shares slipped below that key floor a couple of times in the meantime, the floor mostly remains intact.

When one takes a step back and looks at the longer-term view, however, it’s clear there’s room for a bit more upside until the upper boundary of a major trading range is encountered again.Finally, with nothing more than a quick glance at the Paychex chart, it appears the stock is still in an uptrend, though a slowing one. And, perhaps that benign outcome is what lies ahead. Only time will tell.But, given the sheer scope of the rally since late last year, the slowdown is concerning simply because it may point to an outright reversal into a downtrend.

ayroll, human resources, and employee services provider   reports on the final quarter of its fiscal 2019 year on June 26 before the markets open for trading. Will the company be able to maintain its phenomenal stock ascent of 37% year to date? Below, let's review significant items that will influence investors' reactions when Paychex issues its financial statements next Wednesday.  Paychex completed its $1.2 billion acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing, the nation's largest PEO (professional employer organization), in late December 2018. To make its earnings projections a little easier on investors, Paychex's fiscal 2019 outlook excludes the impacts of Oasis on revenue and earnings.The company's guidance calls for year-over-year revenue growth of 4% in the management solutions segment, growth of 18% to 20% in the PEO and insurances services segment, and growth of interest on funds held for clients of 20% to 25%. This equates to an overall year-over-year revenue improvement of 6% to 7%. Barring an unexpected fourth-quarter stumble, Paychex shouldn't have a problem meeting this target, as it recorded top-line expansion of 10% through the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. Moreover, in the company's third-quarter , management provided a ballpark fourth-quarter revenue growth estimate of 9%, so executives' confidence on the revenue front remains high.As for earnings, the company projects full-year improvement of roughly 4% in net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) over fiscal 2018 benchmarks of $933.7 million and $2.58, respectively. Again, these targets are well within reach, since through the first nine months of the year, Paychex has recorded $804 million in net income and $2.22 in diluted EPS.Image source: Getty Images.One of the factors driving Paychex's shares higher is the company's improving operating leverage. As Paychex has bulked up its top line , it's maintained rich profit margins: Through three quarters of the current fiscal year, the company achieved an  of nearly 37%. This high level of operating profitability resulted in a net profit margin of 28%, and, as CFO Efrain Rivera pointed out on last quarter's , it enabled a formidable 42%  over the last 12 months.    Shareholders can expect that management will discuss strategies for margin improvement in the coming fiscal year on next week's . Much of this conversation will likely revolve around Paychex's investments in neuro-linguistic programming, or NLP. Paychex has created a platform that combines NLP with artificial intelligence (AI) to automate some of its customer-service function via chatbots.While the use of chatbots is an exploratory field for many large corporations seeking to improve customer service, it's especially relevant for a company like Paychex, which offers communication-intensive services like payroll processing. Automating the answering of customer questions on payroll and other human capital management (HCM) tasks translates into higher efficiency and tangible margin improvement for Paychex. And as CFO Rivera and CEO Martin Mucci both observed last quarter, the availability of this technology also helps to accelerate sales.In both Paychex's earnings release and  next week, shareholders will hone in on guidance for the coming fiscal year. Management has already provided an informal preliminary framework for 2020.This includes the expectation that the management solutions segment will again post year-over-year revenue growth of 4%. Including Oasis sales, the PEO and insurances services segment is slated to notch top-line expansion of 30% to 35% through roughly the midpoint of the fiscal year, when the acquisition will reach its first anniversary. Finally, operating margin is once again expected to land in the 37% to 38% range. Investors will receive tightened estimates on both revenue and earnings when Paychex provides a formal fiscal 2020 outlook alongside earnings next week.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"hares of   have appreciated 31% over the last 12 months, or roughly 35.5% -- if, like me, you focus on total return. Investors have endorsed Paychex shares in part because of the company's relentless pursuit of double-digit revenue expansion. In Paychex's third-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings released last week, total revenue advanced by 14% over the prior-year period to $1.1 billion. This increase was split nearly down the middle between organic growth and revenue gleaned from the company's $1.2 billion acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, which was completed on Dec. 21, 2018.Oasis is a human resources (HR) outsourcing corporation, known more commonly as a professional employer organization (PEO). Before its acquisition by Paychex, Oasis was the largest private PEO in the U.S. As corporations' costs to administer HR functions and to provide employee benefits rise, Paychex has invested heavily in the PEO model. The company also acquired Charlotte, N.C.-based HR Outsourcing, Inc. (HROI) in 2017 to beef up its PEO capabilities.  The PEO business falls under Paychex's PEO and insurance segment (which adds employee health insurance, workers' compensation, business liability, and other types of insurance products to PEO offerings). These services are in high demand: Even after excluding the effect of the Oasis acquisition, management expects PEO and insurance services revenue to grow by 18% to 20% in fiscal 2019.By contrast, Paychex's management solutions segment (which includes payroll processing services, compliance, retirement, and other business services) is expected to achieve just 4% year-over-year top-line expansion in the current fiscal year. Yet Paychex continually reinvests in this mature segment, as it's central to overall results. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management solutions accounted for 77% of total company revenue. Management finds it eminently sensible to frequently upgrade the software and services that comprise the company's bedrock payroll services.To illustrate, on Paychex's Q3 2019  last week, executives extolled recent chatbot and other artificial intelligence enhancements to Paychex Flex (the company's online payroll and HR administration solution) as part of an ongoing effort to upgrade the customer experience.Image source: Getty Images.Management solutions' future contributions will remain significant. To cite one pertinent example, Paychex held an average of $4.4 billion of client funds in its accounts last quarter to fund payrolls and remit payroll taxes to the government. The company earned $23 million in interest income on this money -- an amount equal to roughly 5% of total operating income of $429 million during the quarter.Thus, Paychex is engaged in a balancing act between feeding its cash cow, management solutions, while ensuring that its cash calf segment, PEO and insurance, also receives tangible growth resources. Nurturing these complementary revenue streams isn't Paychex's only balancing act, however; the organization has also recently achieved near-symmetry between organic and acquired growth.Paychex is becoming something of a serial acquirer. While the Oasis transaction was the largest purchase in Paychex's recent history, acquisitions haven't been limited to PEO and insurance service. In March of last year, the company acquired the Lessor Group, a Danish firm specializing in payroll and HCM (human capital management systems), thus gaining wider exposure to management solutions services in Europe. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2019, total company revenue of $2.8 billion increased by 10% year over year. According to management, the Oasis, HROI, and Lessor acquisitions contributed ""less than five percent"" of this growth. In other words, M&A activity supplied a bit less than half of Paychex's top-line improvement last quarter, while organic growth made up the balance.Any significant future acquisitions will likely rely on borrowed funds. The company has traditionally only indulged in sporadic and small amounts of long-term borrowings; it now holds $800 million in long-term debt on its balance sheet following the Oasis acquisition. But Paychex has ample capacity to take on more debt. Given $1.5 billion in trailing 12-month , Paychex sports a debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of roughly 0.5, a measure that indicates relatively low leverage. By my calculation, the company could easily add another $4 billion in long-term debt to its liabilities before shareholders begin to fret about its debt load.Given Paychex's successful balancing acts, is now a good time to add the PAYX symbol to your portfolio? Both Paychex and larger rival  are presently trading at a premium to the broader market, sporting forward price-to-earnings ratios of 28 and 30, respectively. This is perhaps an indication of payroll providers' ability to improve earnings alongside the growth of the broader economy while also prospering during downturns, due to evergreen markets for human capital management and payroll services.I believe Paychex may present more compelling value at a lower entry point. Should last year's overall market volatility return at some juncture in 2019, investors with a long-term mindset may consider picking up shares if and when a sell-off readjusts Paychex's current trading multiple. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"[Editor’s note: This story was previously published in September 2018. It has since been updated and republished.]One of the most popular investment strategies is to focus on fast-charging growth companies. The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adage cash is king. The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call “cash cows.”While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a business’ lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. That’s why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.Another reason to look at a company’s money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options. They can choose to put money to work through key investments, or to expand operations.And if the worst happens, and the underlying industry hits a recession, cash cows can better weather the storm. Because of this dynamic, you’ll want to at least peek at the cash flow statement for your target investments.Below are the eight best cash cow stocks to buy now:

	I’m going to make a confession straight off the bat. I don’t understand why people eat at  (NYSE:), particularly those who do so regularly. Admittedly, they make great coffee and their French fries are to die for, but the rest of it? Not quite so appetizing.Nevertheless, I don’t need to understand a phenomenon to recognize that it’s working. Moreover, those who are looking primarily for reliable stocks to invest in should seriously consider MCD stock. Last year, the iconic fast-food company generated nearly $5.6 billion in cash flow from operations. In their most recent quarter, MCD produced $1.34 billion in operating cash flow, up over 10% from the year-ago level.Additionally, McDonald’s enjoys consistent FCF every year, offering invaluable confidence in a rising, but unpredictable market. Plus, MCD pays out a 2.46% dividend yield, which management should have no problems sustaining.

	We often say that there are two guarantees in life: death and taxes. In reality, we should add a third, which is random events that conspire to ruin your day. Whether it’s a massive accident or a debilitating illness, stuff happens. When it does, ’s (NYSE:) insurance products can help you or your family recover financially.It’s amazing how much a relatively common occurrence, such as a broken leg, can add up to serious . Just for the consistent demand, AFL should be on most people’s list of stocks to buy. And as you might expect, Aflac enjoys robust cash flows from operations. Last year, the insurance provider generated $6.1 billion. It also has FCF that averaged over $6 billion over the past four years.AFL is one of those conservative stocks to buy that have performed well in the markets. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up nearly 9.5%. Better yet, Aflac pays out a 2.09% dividend yield. Steady growth and passive income? AFL is too good to ignore.

	If you’re asked to come down to the human resources department, chances are, it’s for unpleasant reasons. Nevertheless, HR plays a crucial role as it deals directly with a company’s most valuable asset: people. You can never go wrong with experts in this field, which is why  (NASDAQ:) is a consistent winner.But another factor boosting PAYX is their product flexibility. Despite their big-name brand, they offer  for virtually any organization. From tiny businesses with a lone employee to major, multinational firms, PAYX can tailor-fit an effective, efficient platform. That will come in handy over the next few years as new businesses focus on agility rather than brute size.As you might expect, Paychex features a healthy balance between growth and cash flows. In the most recent quarter, PAYX rang up $1.1 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year.

	The video game sector offers some of the best stocks to invest in. Thanks to gaming culture and tournaments going mainstream, this is an industry that will perpetually rise higher. Over the longer-term, this presents a viable tailwind for  (NASDAQ:).Admittedly, though, the ride in ATVI hasn’t been an easy one. While its YTD performance is pretty much flat, shares have gyrated severely multiple times. Investors have an understandable concern that they’re buying into ATVI near at or near its highs. Moreover, Activision has suffered significant competition; namely, ’ “Fortnite.”Still, I’m not worried. In terms of first-person shooting games, ATVI is still the king. Its “” series is legitimately a cash cow. Furthermore, Activision’s financials have consistently demonstrated rising cash flow from operations. That might take a hit this year due to the competitive environment.However, don’t count out ATVI. Not only can Activision leverage its own strengths in shooter games, “Fortnite” mania .

Out of all the cash cow stocks to buy,  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) stands alone. One of the chief reasons why is due to the company’s prevalence across multiple lucrative markets. From laptops to cloud computing to driverless-vehicle technology, GOOG disrupts any sector it wishes.But the biggest reason I like Alphabet is that it . I realize that it’s a tired argument because everybody has mentioned it. That doesn’t mean, though, that the argument is any less valid. For instance, we all know that Google is the . But the gap between first place and second-ranked Bing is a whopping 66%!Moreover, Google is the unquestioned leader of mobile and tablet search engines with a 93% market share. In order to get anything done online, you essentially must go through Alphabet. And if your company doesn’t rank well on Google, you’re dead in the water.In the most recent quarter it generated more than $39 billion in revenues.

	On the surface, it appears big tobacco firms like   (NYSE:) face a double-whammy. First, Americans are . Also, the under-18 crowd isn’t taking up the habit like prior generations had. Second, the vaping market has exploded in popularity thanks to its cleaner platform.Naturally, PM stock has taken a big hit in the markets. On a YTD basis, shares have lost nearly 23%. Still, I don’t think it’s over for Philip Morris. For one thing, several markets, including the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, have witnessed a . That of course suits PM perfectly, which is the international arm of the iconic tobacco firm.Second, PM is intently focused on , which is a type of vaporizer. What makes IQOS distinct from the vaping competition is authenticity. PM understands the nuances that smokers are looking for, and they seek to replicate that experience in a digital platform.Best of all, Philip Morris is a cash-rich organization. Last year, it delivered $9.48 billion in operating cash flow, and it’s on pace for $10 billion this year. That provides substantial confidence in the company’s generous 5.19% dividend yield.

	Thanks to an unpredictable political environment, and an extremely-competitive atmosphere, several pharmaceuticals have underperformed this year.  (NASDAQ:) is no exception, with GILD shares having gained only a little more than 1% YTD under choppy conditions.But in the long run, I don’t expect this pressured situation to continue. Recently, Gilead announced positive results from a late-stage clinical trial of a . Additionally, management is looking forward to developing iterations of its HIV drug, Biktarvy. GILD could develop an injectable version of Biktarvy for patients who are resistant to the drug.If nothing else, GILD belongs on your list of stocks to buy thanks to its cash position. Even under a challenging environment, Gilead managed nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow last year. The company is more than stable enough to continue supporting its dividend yield, which currently stands at 3.97%.

	As Canada’s ,  (NYSE:) essentially has a moat. In this day and age, no one can survive without internet access. As such, BCE leverages extensive broadband and wireless networks that have a value north of $4 billion. The company’s broadband footprint extends out to 9.2 million locations, and it offers LTE wireless coverage for almost every Canadian.These impressive stats finally have started to translate into market success. So far this year, BCE shares are up more than 10%. .Shares have grown slowly and steadily since the beginning of the year, suggesting the worst of the volatility is behind it. Second, BCE’s revenues have steadily increased over the past three years, and we’re on pace for a fourth. Finally, BCE offers a generous 5.36% dividend yield, which the company can support.Last year, the telecom firm had $5.8 billion in operating cash flow, and $2.6 billion FCF. Unless Canadians suddenly stop using the internet, you can trust BCE.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable Returns@2019-03-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-8-best-cash-cow-stocks-to-buy-for-stable-returns-2019-03-28
"hares of  (NASDAQ: PAYX) have appreciated 31% over the last 12 months, or roughly 35.5% -- if, like me, you focus on total return. Investors have endorsed Paychex shares in part because of the company's relentless pursuit of double-digit revenue expansion.In Paychex's third-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings released last week, total revenue advanced by 14% over the prior-year period to $1.1 billion. This increase was split nearly down the middle between organic growth and revenue gleaned from the company's $1.2 billion acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, which was completed on Dec. 21, 2018.Oasis is a human resources (HR) outsourcing corporation, known more commonly as a professional employer organization (PEO). Before its acquisition by Paychex, Oasis was the largest private PEO in the U.S. As corporations' costs to administer HR functions and to provide employee benefits rise, Paychex has invested heavily in the PEO model. The company also acquired Charlotte, N.C.-based HR Outsourcing, Inc. (HROI) in 2017 to beef up its PEO capabilities.The PEO business falls under Paychex's PEO and insurance segment (which adds employee health insurance, workers' compensation, business liability, and other types of insurance products to PEO offerings). These services are in high demand: Even after excluding the effect of the Oasis acquisition, management expects PEO and insurance services revenue to grow by 18% to 20% in fiscal 2019.By contrast, Paychex's management solutions segment (which includes payroll processing services, compliance, retirement, and other business services) is expected to achieve just 4% year-over-year top-line expansion in the current fiscal year.Yet Paychex continually reinvests in this mature segment, as it's central to overall results. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management solutions accounted for 77% of total company revenue. Management finds it eminently sensible to frequently upgrade the software and services that comprise the company's bedrock payroll services.To illustrate, on Paychex's Q3 2019  last week, executives extolled recent chatbot and other artificial intelligence enhancements to Paychex Flex (the company's online payroll and HR administration solution) as part of an ongoing effort to upgrade the customer experience.Image source: Getty Images.Management solutions' future contributions will remain significant. To cite one pertinent example, Paychex held an average of $4.4 billion of client funds in its accounts last quarter to fund payrolls and remit payroll taxes to the government. The company earned $23 million in interest income on this money -- an amount equal to roughly 5% of total operating income of $429 million during the quarter.Thus, Paychex is engaged in a balancing act between feeding its cash cow, management solutions, while ensuring that its cash calf segment, PEO and insurance, also receives tangible growth resources. Nurturing these complementary revenue streams isn't Paychex's only balancing act, however; the organization has also recently achieved near-symmetry between organic and acquired growth.Paychex is becoming something of a serial acquirer.

The stock market had a big bounce on Tuesday and started off higher on Wednesday as well. By lunchtime though, investors were staring at ~1% losses across the board, although they have since erased about half of those losses. What’s going on out there? We remain in a messy, choppy market after the indices’ big rally off the December lows. Let’s look at what’s moving in the market today and get an idea of what top stock trades to watch going through the rest of this week.Let’s talk about the  (NYSEARCA:). This name has been a leader over the past few quarters, both on the upside and the downside. Earlier this month, the IWM put in a lower high from the month prior and failed to hold its 200-day moving average.It’s now below the 50-day and 20-day moving averages as well. The setup is…not great. But that said, it’s not like the rally is completely giving way. There are some negative catalysts working against stocks — like fears of a global recession — but the Fed remains patient and earnings aren’t getting sacked.That, to me, limits our downside. However, that does not mean we’re immune to a pullback and/or consolidation. Bulls may want to be a bit more cautious, at least until the IWM can recapture the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. I’m not a huge fan of the lower highs and lower lows, but that concern is only that, as long as we’re over $145. (NASDAQ:) is down about 10% after a number of downgrades came in .So far, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement for the 52-week range is holding up as support, but CRON is far from out of the woods. If this level fails, there could certainly be more downside.The prior breakout is down near $14 to $15, while the 50% retracement is at $15.06. So should CRON take out Wednesday’s lows, this could be its destination down the road. Dip buyers need to use caution, especially with CRON below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages.A slightly higher open on Thursday followed by a decline that takes out Wednesday’s low could give bears a low-risk short-term shorting opportunity.Shares of  (NYSE:) started off higher on the day, but faded from its opening gains after the company . PAYX stock is now down almost 2% on the day.The report wasn’t necessarily bad, but perhaps it wasn’t enough to sustain new highs. Worth noting though, PAYX did make new 52-week highs in the session. That said, it’s near channel resistance on the weekly chart.At the very least, bulls may wait for a pullback into the 20-week or 50-week moving averages. However, waiting for a potential test of the 100-week moving average and/or channel support has proven to be much more prudent. It also allows bulls to enter into a less risky setup should it get there. Patience may be key here with PAYX.Shares of  (NYSE:) are rallying despite the company cutting its capacity guidance. A stock rallying on bad news is a good sign for a possible bottom.In either case, bulls have a reasonable setup. So far, the stock is holding above the 200-week moving average. Should the stock lose this level the recent lows near $45, it will tumble into no man’s land. $45 is a notable multi-year level, but there’s potential uptrend support (purple line) near this level as well.Aggressive bulls can go long on a weekly close over the 200-week moving average. Conservative bulls may want to wait for a potential pullback. If it materializes, an entry near $45 sets up a low-risk long. (NASDAQ:) has been a , but shares have been getting whacked over the past few sessions. Short-term uptrend support (blue line) didn’t hold as support, nor did the 20-day moving average.That leaves the post-earnings open and the 50-day moving average near $170 on the table. Should these levels fail to hold, growth investors sure would love to snap this name up between $150 and $160.If you like mid cap growth stocks, TTD should surely be on your list. But keep in mind, it’s a volatile one, so investors need a strong stomach.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Phillip Morris (PM), Bristol-Myers (BMY) and Walgreens Boots (WBA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  ' shares have gained +6.7% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Tobacco industry's decline of -2.4%. The Zacks analyst thinks the company is gaining from its strong pricing strategies. In fact, favorable pricing has played an important role in boosting revenues for a while.Also, this drove the company's performance in the fourth quarter of 2018, wherein it delivered the third and the fourth straight quarter of top- and bottom-line surprises, respectively. The company is also undertaking initiatives to strengthen RRPs, which are rapidly gaining market popularity. In fact, it has introduced new versions of IQOS to capture market share.Additionally, the company provided a favorable view for 2019. However, Philip Morris is grappling with declines in total shipment volumes, stemming from weak cigarette sales. Stringent regulations on tobacco products have been marring cigarette industry volumes. Moreover, unfavorable currency movements are a viable threat.(You can  ).Shares of  have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the past six months, losing -22.9% vs. +2.1%. Bristol-Myers' blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo continues to perform well. The Zacks analyst thinks the approval of the drug for first-line RCC and adjuvant melanoma has boosted sales. Label expansion of other drugs like Sprycel and Empliciti should further drive the company's performance.In January, Bristol-Myers announced that it will acquire Celgene for an equity value of approximately $74 billion. While the acquisition will bolster the company's portfolio, it is being opposed by a few shareholders, who believe that the deal is overpriced, significantly increasing shareholders' risk.Moreover, the company's voluntary withdrawal of the sBLA seeking approval of Opdivo+Yervoy as a treatment for first-line NSCLC with tumor mutational burden greater or equal to 10 mutations/megabase was disappointing, given the market potential.(You can  ). ' shares have outperformed the Zacks Drug Stores industry over the past six months, losing -13.7% vs. -24.4%. The Zacks analyst thinks that within the Retail Pharmacy USA division, the company has been making solid progress with respect to boosting prescription volume. Walgreens Boots is launching a phase of transformational cost management to reduce margin pressure.The company has been gaining from strategic tie-ups as well. Walgreens Boots' recent alliance with Microsoft to use the Azure platform is a welcome move. The company's deal with Alphabet's life sciences and healthcare segment, Verily is another positive. The company's decision to launch next-day prescription delivery service with FedEx provides further cause for optimism.On the flip side, tough market conditions, particularly in retail, have been leading to sluggishness in Walgreens Boots' Retail Pharmacy International division. The ongoing generic drug inflation is hurting pharmacy margins as well.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Paychex (PAYX), Sirius XM (SIRI) and Total System Services (TSS).Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

From 2000 - 2018, while the S&P averaged +4.8% per year, our top strategies averaged up to +56.2% per year.Mark VickerySenior EditorThe Zacks analyst believes that Sanofi has many new products and pipeline candidates that can drive long-term growth. Weak diabetes sales and generic competition for many drugs are headwinds.Per the Zacks analyst, Sirius XM's solid content slate, which drives subscriber growth and average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to improve further following the Pandora acquisition.Per the Zacks analyst, strong backlogs for innovative hybrid and electric propulsion engines helps BorgWarner to expand market presence.Per the Zacks analyst, Returns-Focused Growth plan and Built-to-Order process bode well for KB Homes strong overall performance.Per the Zacks analyst, Catalyst remains focused on the development and label expansion of Firdapse amidst competition.Per the Zacks analyst, continuous focus on debt reduction and improving its liquidity position will strengthen Natural Resource Partners' financial position going forward.Per the Zacks analyst, Hibbett is poised to gain from improving e-commerce penetration.The Zacks analyst is impressed with Paychex's efforts to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization industry. Demand for outsourcing is another growth catalyst.Per the Zacks analyst, CommScope aims to capitalize on industry trends, including network convergence and 5G on the back of its strong market position coupled with the proposed acquisition of ARRIS.Per the Zacks analyst, Federated's strategic acquisitions have resulted in asset growth and expansion in market share. Also, rise in interest rates will positively impact top-line performance.Per the Zacks analyst, the company's high debt level, which have been increasing over the past several years, continues to weigh on margins.The Zacks analyst is worried about challenging pricing scenario that continues to plague ResMed. Reimbursement issues and rising costs are other downsides.Per the Zacks analyst, PriceSmart is grappling with soft comparable net merchandise sales for quite some time now.

This is better than the company’s revenue of $936.10 million reported in its fiscal third quarter of the previous year. It also matches analysts’ revenue estimate for the period.All this sounds good. So why is Paychex stock down on Wednesday? It likely has to do with its revenue outlook for the full year of 2019. This has it expecting revenue to increase 6% to 7% for the year. Unfortunately for PAYX stock, Wall Street is expecting revenue to increase by roughly 11% to $3.74 billion.PAYX stock was down 2% as of Wednesday morning.As of this writing, William White did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Paychex Earnings: PAYX Stock Falls on Q3 Meet@2019-03-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-earnings-payx-stock-falls-q3-meet-2019-03-27

Management solutions revenue grew 4%, and PEO and insurance services revenues grew a strong 65%, of course, reflecting the inclusion of the Oasis Outsourcing Group acquisition. On December 20, 2018, we acquired Oasis, the largest privately held PEO in the U.S. and an industry leader in providing HR outsourcing services, for approximately $1.2 billion.We financed this acquisition with $800 million of new long-term debt along with cash on hand. Oasis is a great fit for our PEO growth strategy, adding to our scale, expanding relationships with new insurance partners, creating up-sell opportunities into the existing Oasis customer base and augmenting our talent with an addition of an experienced leadership team.

Efrain? -- Thanks, Martin, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. [Audio gap] involve risk. Please refer to our earnings release that provides disclosure on forward-looking statements and related risk factors.In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measures include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and the investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the third quarter to their related GAAP measures. I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, then follow with some greater detail in certain areas.I'll touch briefly on year-to-date results and wrap with a review of our fiscal 2019 outlook and '20 framework. So look also at the investor presentation, we've got more detail there. Total revenue and total service revenue both grew 14% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively, our first $1 billion quarter and hopefully, the first of many to come. The acquisition of Oasis in December 2018 accounted for approximately one half of the growth in service revenue.Expenses increased 13% for the third quarter to $641 million. The acquisition of Oasis contributed approximately 12% to this growth. Total expenses for the prior year three months ended February 28, 2018 included, as you'll recall, a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees and a one-time charge following the termination of certain licensing agreements. Total expenses, excluding Oasis and these one-time costs in their respective prior-year period, increased approximately 9% compared to last year.This 9% growth was primarily driven by increased headcount due to investments and sales force technology resources and operations to support the growth in the business. In addition, an increase in PEO insurance pass-through cost impacted the quarter. Operating income increased 16% to $429 million. Operating margin was 40.1% for the third quarter comparing to 39.4% for the same period last year.Adjusted operating income, which excludes the previously mentioned one-time charge in the prior-year quarter, increased 7%. And I just keep referring you back to both the presentations we posted on the investor presentation we posted on the website. It goes through an extensive detail, all of the callouts. Our effective income tax rate was 23.7% for the third quarter, compared to 1.1% for the same period last year.The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax reform in December 2017 resulted in a significant decline in the federal corporate statutory tax rate. In the third quarter last year, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $79 million from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities at this lower rate or at the new lower rate. In addition, during the third quarter last year, we recognized the fiscal year-to-date catch-up for the lower-blended effective tax rate applicable for the fiscal year. These two items resulted in the low 1.1% effective rate for the prior-year quarter.We anticipate that the effective tax rate before any discrete tax items will be approximately 24% for the full year of fiscal 2019. Again, I refer back to the investor presentation. Net income decreased 12% to 325% for the third quarter, primarily due to the significant tax impacts I just discussed, partially offset by the one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements also recognized in the last year's third quarter. Adjusted net income increased 3%.Adjusted net income as a non-GAAP measure that excludes the one-time charge related to termination of the licensing agreements, tax benefit, the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and excess tax benefits related to employees' stock-based comp, which we call out. However, this measure still incorporates the impact of the year-to-date catch-up for the lower-blended federal corporate statutory rate recognized in the third quarter last year, which is moderating the growth for the current period. Diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $0.90 for the third quarter, but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. These growth trends reflect the same factors as discussed for net income.And again, I refer you back to the investor presentation, which details it. I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management solutions revenue, which includes payroll service revenue, together with our HCM products, included in many of our product bundles, increased 4% to $802 million for the third quarter. Lessor contributed less than 1% to the growth.The remaining increase was driven primarily by growth in client bases across our HCM services and growth in revenue per check, which improved as a result of price increases, net of discounts. PEO and insurance. It increased 65% to $246 million for the third quarter. Excluding Oasis, PEO and insurance service revenue would have increased 17% for the third quarter.This growth was primarily driven by the continued strong demand for our combined PEO services, which, along with WSE growth, the worksite employee growth and our existing client bases, resulted in solid growth and in client worksite employees served. Our insurance service revenue benefited from growth and the number of health and benefits applicants. The rate of growth for insurance services was moderated by softness in the workers' comp market. As state insurance funds declined, we expect this trend and workers' comp revenue to persist, and we expect it to persist in the next year, more to follow on that.It will have a modest impact. Interest on funds held for clients. It increased 27% for the third quarter, $23 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down for the third quarter, primarily driven by the impacts of lower client employees' tax withholdings resulting from tax reform and client base mix, partially offset by wage inflation.Investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio currently has an average yield of 2.1% and an average duration of 3.1 years.Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the third quarter, up from 1.5% last year. Year-to-date results, let me briefly summarize where we've been for this nine-month period. Management solutions revenue is up 4%, PEO and insurance revenue increased 40%, 23% without Oasis and 17% organic. Interest on funds held for clients increased 28%, driven by interest rate increases, partially offset by the impact of a 2% decline in average invested balances.Total revenue, this includes obviously, Oasis, up 10%. Operating margins were 37.8%, tempered by accelerated investments in the business and growth in PEO direct insurance costs. Net income increased 4%, and adjusted net income increased 12%. Diluted earnings per share increased 3%, but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12%.Let's go through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $886 million as of February 28, 2019. We had a strong cash flow quarter, even though we utilized part of our cash to pay for the Oasis acquisition. Funds held for clients as of February 28, 2019 were $5.4 billion, compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018.Funds held for clients. As you know, very widely in a day-to-day basis, averaging $4.4 billion for the third quarter and $3.9 billion for the nine months. Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $10 million, compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018. Total stockholders' equity was $2.6 billion as of February 28, 2019, reflecting $604 million in dividends paid and $33 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.Our return on equity for the past 12 months was up formidable 42%. Cash flows from operations were $1 billion for the nine months, an increase of 3% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and noncash adjustments, partially offset by working capital fluctuations, working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for the combined PEO business, it decrease in accrued liability balances in connection with the termination of certain licensing agreements in fiscal 2018. Now turning to 2019 guidance, I will discuss the guidance for full-year fiscal 2019.I'd remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic conditions. Continue with no significant changes, we maintained our guidance as provided last quarter, including the overlay on Oasis, which I'll talk about in a second. I will reiterate these guidance ranges and provide some color where applicable. And then just finally to remind everyone, I'll give the guidance first excluding any anticipated impact from the Oasis acquisition, then follow it with the anticipated impact of Oasis on our results.And I would say this, some of you have updated your models for the inclusion of Oasis, some have not, and so we thought that it made more sense and was better to be very clear to say, here's what our base guidance is and then the overlay of Oasis, so just remember that as I walk through this. So excluding Oasis, management solutions, expected to grow approximately 4%; PEO and insurance, anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%; interest on funds held for clients, anticipated to grow 20% to 25%; total revenue, anticipated to grow in the range of 6% to 7%; operating income as a percent of total revenue, anticipated to be approximately 37%; interest income, net, anticipated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million; the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019, expected to be approximately 24%; net income and diluted earnings per share anticipated to grow approximately 4%; adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both expected to increase in the range of 11% to 12%. We give the guidance this way so there can be no confusion as the fact that we're tracking exactly to the plan that we set at the beginning of the year, and don't blend or confuse the info on Oasis. So now let's talk about it when we include Oasis.It's anticipated, as we said previously, they have an incremental impact on total revenue in the range of $155 million to $175 million in fiscal 2019. As we've refined these numbers, we think that that number is going to be on the lower end of that range, in the low 160s. Excluding one-time cost related to the acquisition, Oasis is anticipated to have minimal impact on earnings per share. Now when we include one-time acquisition and integration costs, we anticipate the impact on diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.03 per share for fiscal 2019.And that's consistent with what we've said previously, a little more color on where we fall within that $155 million to $175 million, and that really has everything to do with the way we are looking at pass-through costs in that business. I'll provide you with a little additional color for the last quarter of the year. Consistent with how we guided on last quarter's call, we anticipate that management solutions revenue growth in Q4 will be below the full-year rate due to the anniversary, primarily, among other things, of the Lessor acquisition, we still think that management solutions will fall between 3% and 4%. Last quarter, we indicated that for Q3, we anticipated PEO and insurance services revenue increase in the range of 15% to 17% and for Q4 to be in the range of 10% to 13%.Growth in Q3 came in at the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter, and we now expect growth for Q4 to be approximately 9%, so below that range. There's two reasons for that, there was some timing of revenue that shifted between quarters on the insurance side. And despite this, we anticipate achieving our full-year guidance range. We'll talk a little bit more about what we're seeing as we talk about the '20 guidance, but there's also a little bit of softness on the workers comp portion of our insurance revenue that pulls that revenue down a bit.Now let me talk about the 2020, and I would just caveat everything I'm saying by saying that we haven't completed our planning process, but we thought, given the Oasis acquisition and the fact that you'll need to update models, we thought we'd give you some preview of what we're looking at for the year including Oasis. We'll provide detailed guidance during our fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter call as we always do. But let me give you some high-level commentary based on a preliminary look into next fiscal year. Management solutions revenue growth, we anticipate it to be comparable to the growth in 2019.PEO and insurance revenue, excluding Oasis, anticipated to reflect low double-digit growth, so that means about in the range of around 10%. Including Oasis, PEO and insurance services revenue growth will be in the range of 30% to 35% with growth higher in the first half of the year until the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition. Operating margins at this stage we think will be in the range of 37% to 38%. We'll see where we end this year, but that anticipates some improvement, some leverage on the base business.We anticipate Oasis will contribute revenue in the range of $355 million to $375 million next year, and it's going to be largely neutral to earnings per share. With the significance of the interest expense and the amortization expense associated with the Oasis acquisition, we introduced a discussion of EBITDA margins. Please refer to the investor presentation on our IR web page for the calculation of EBITDA for the first nine months of of fiscal 2019. We anticipate EBITDA for the full-year fiscal 2019 will be approximately 41%, and we expect EBITDA as a percent of total revenue for fiscal 2020 to be consistent with fiscal 2019.And if you look at the way we calculate EBITDA, it's pretty simple and should be pretty easy to follow. I reiterate that these comments are very preliminary and subject to revision as we finalize our plans for next year. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. By the way, I just wanted to clarify one thing that 37% to 38%, it's clear on the web page, that operating margin I cited would exclude Oasis.So look at the slide, it I think lays it out pretty clearly. So with that, I'll end my comments and turn it back to Marty. -- OK. Thank you, Efrain. And operator, now we'll open the call to questions, please. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. -- This is Damian on for Ramsey. Hoping you guys can talk a little bit about your long-term growth expectations for the PEO and insurance revenue, obviously, you'd provided that preliminary framework for 2020, which I really appreciate at the low double digits. But I think we were thinking about that more in like a mid-teens type of a rate. Can you maybe dissect what's going on in there? And why the declaration year over year? -- So the answer to that is, I gave you PEO and insurance. So our PEO business, our base PEO business is growing in the teens, insurance pulls that growth rate down a little bit. I would just say that insurance revenue can vary from year to year. It could very well be by the back half of next year, growth in insurance revenue picks up again.So it oscillates. Our PEO growth, we expect it to be in the teens. So that's one thing. And then the second thing is, we'll have to see when we anniversary Oasis, what our growth rate coming out of that will be because the numbers are larger.So I think that's the answer to the question. -- OK. And on the operating margin then for 2020. It's nice to see some of the leverage in the model there. Maybe if you could talk about some places that you guys are looking to invest next year or maybe in Q4 here and then into next year.Like what are the places that you guys are going to invest in? And how that kind of plays into your operating margin expectations? -- I would say that as we get into next year, we identified areas where we would invest this year as part of tax reform. And so there will be a continuation of those three broad buckets of investment. Not at the same level that we invested this year, certainly, on a net basis, meaning, we're getting some benefits from it, well, you won't see the same level of net spend that you saw this year. But we will continue to invest in marketing and sales, I think a little bit less in sales.And on the marketing side, continue to invest in operational efficiencies and then continue to work on IP and product. So Martin, you can go. -- Yes. One of the other things, as Efrain mentioned, those are the same things you'll see continuation of that and a little bit lower, but the product acceleration would be the other one that -- to the ones that Efrain mentioned. So lead generation, demand generation has been a big focus for us. A lot more leads coming in over the web.And I really think we're hitting our stride through some of the programs we put in place at the beginning of this fiscal year to drive more demand and then nurture those leads, because so many more are coming in that way and then handling them as well through internal sales. So we've really continued to invest there. Product acceleration, these were things that we were going to do. We accelerated, particularly, into this quarter, a lot of product around HR, what we call, our HR center and enhancing that with data analytics, learning management system to provide training for our employees and their clients and performance management among other things.So product acceleration, lead generation and operating efficiencies as well, using some of the work we've done and now chatbots and chat and other self-service capabilities that our clients we're looking for.Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- This is actually Amit Singh for Jason. You guys just went through the key selling season. So what were the key takeaways from there? Anything that stood out as being different this year versus, let's say, past couple of years in terms of competition, pricing, etc.? -- Yes. I think the competitive environment is about the same. We didn't see a big change there. We feel year to date, we're really seeing the best-selling seasons selling, frankly, in par growth that we've had in a few years.So that continued. I think it was moderated a little bit in January -- in the December, January kind of time frame, between the government shutdown, the market kind of dropping and then rebounding and etc. So we saw a little moderation there, but really when you look at the selling season overall for a par growth, we don't really give the number, but it's the best we've seen in three years, and certainly, year to date it's the same thing. So we're feeling great momentum, particularly, on the HR Solutions and PEO side of the business, insurances, health insurance and our inside sales piece as well. -- OK. And then just expanding on that competitive dynamics into your PEO market, and especially, as we look at your fiscal '20 guidance versus '19, there has been some strong growth for a while there, but is it now getting noticeably more crowded? -- Well, actually I think, we're building even more strength with adding Oasis and now serving through the various, not just PEO, but our other HR outsourcing solutions of 1.4 million worksite employees. We've built a real strength, and we expect to capitalize on that with carrier relations, the insurance carrier relations expanding into other states and selling our products into the Oasis base as well. So as Efrain said, I think, if you look at the whole PEO and insurance segment, it's moderated a bit, but a lot of that coming from the insurance side of it and particularly, workers' comp, which, I think, you know, cycles, working in a down-rate environment, which has actually picked up pretty quickly. And so once those state funds lower their insurance rates and the impact on the overall workers' comp rates have come down, that's really accelerated in the last couple of months.And that's going to put some moderation on the PEO and insurance line. But the PEO itself, we expect still to be very strong and particularly with the recent acquisition with Oasis, of course, and HROI as well. We feel very good about the leadership teams. They are the integration that's already under way.Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. -- I was wondering if you could maybe go a little bit further on the selling season commentary you had a minute ago, Marty. Just given what you've seen from Oasis thus far, what's been the reaction from clients with respect to the addition of that to your broad portfolio? And I guess, more broadly speaking, heading into fiscal '20, do you feel kind of incrementally better or worse about the growth in the kind of the core payroll franchise, revenue growth, heading into next year? -- Yes. I think, starting with the PEO, I think we've gotten good positive feedback from clients. I think Oasis already had a strong feeling from their clients and the leadership, Mark Perlberg, who has been running Oasis and is leading our PEO as we combine it. We're really designing a great balance of selling into new clients and selling into the base as well.Of course, we have a top 20 insurance agency that now Oasis can use the strength of that. So where insurance is not a good fit on the PEO model, you can now add Oasis clients as -- in new sales, like we've done, can now go to the insurance agency to be able to get insurance. So we're adding some strength there. Of course, they had different carriers, relationship levels than we did, and so we're expanding into new states.So I think the reaction has been good. The opportunity is great. And I think the integration is going very well from that standpoint. On the core payroll side, I think that competition has continued to be about the same.It's competitive. The pricing though hasn't changed a lot. I think we still have some pricing power there. Would always like to see that growth a little stronger, but that's also the way we're leading our sales now.We're leading much more with HR overall. So we're selling more bundles, we're selling more into the PEO and HR outsourcing. And you're not getting quite as much of the demand for payroll only and that's exactly how we expected it. So I think you're seeing price and level of competition the same there.It's OK. It's not as strong as we'd like, but I think it's moving exactly the way we thought toward more HR. Now on the SurePayroll side, for example, I mentioned that we just introduced an e-commerce option, we're seeing that that is helping not only accept more leads but gain more clients that way. It's early in the process.But what you're finding is, if a client comes in and can complete the entire transaction on their own or get help from our internal sales teams if they need it and kind of complete the whole thing in an e-commerce platform, that's pretty strong as far as capturing the client when they're looking, instead of getting a lead and then trying to reach the client, who may have decided to go to someone else because they couldn't talk to someone or complete the transaction. So I'm thinking we're seeing some positive growth there, and they're doing, and we are seeing some strong growth on the low end because of that. -- That's helpful. And then maybe relative to the margin outlook you're providing for fiscal '20. It looks like on an apples-to-apples basis, you're calling for margin expansion of a little bit over 50 bps, if I'm not mistaken. So I guess, could you maybe just kind of clarify relative to the reinvestments you've been making, do you feel like you have all the investment you need on the product side at this point to the extent that you're going to get incremental leverage off of that investment from here on out? And then maybe, Efrain, you can just clarify what the expected operating margin drag from Oasis will be for fiscal '20, roughly speaking. -- OK, so Jim, those are all interrelated. So you carefully pars what we said as usual. We said that this year's guidance, excluding Oasis, operating margins would be approximately 37%. And then the preliminary framework we're saying is between 37% to 38%, that would imply exactly what you would say.I would caveat one thing, Jim, that obviously, we could end up a little bit stronger than 37%, in which case the leverage will be a little bit less. But the premise to your question is valid. So what's happening is that, when we invested in year one, you don't see the benefits or the results of that investment in year one, you get into year two, you're continuing to invest, and you start to now get benefits from investments made in year one. That's why I carefully said, the net spend that we have relative to the investments we made after tax reform goes down, so you're seeing that in the margin.And the second thing before I turn it over to Marty, talk a little bit more about that, is to say that, when we think about what that spending has done and will do for us, it becomes a down payment for roadmap to the future where additional opportunities for leverage exist. Marty mentioned the investments we've made in things like that chatbots using AI NLP, machine learning, and not to be overlooked are things like the e-commerce developments we put into SurePayroll. And again, we are the first publicly traded company that has created that platform. So all of those now become things that we can leverage in the business to drive further efficiencies and in some cases, also in additional sales.So we're getting benefits. It's opening up other pathways that we hadn't considered. And that will be a benefit to us in the future. -- Yes. so I think Efrain's pretty much covered. The investments we made kind of from the tax reform that we talked about, starting really last year, was that that would do that from a product standpoint, we accelerated the product. In fact, a lot of that rolled out in the first two quarters and then in this quarter.From an HR center perspective, we're very happy with that that we were able to accelerate that. And then on the efficiencies, a lot of it has also been done to create those operating efficiencies. And the chatbot, for example, someone who wants to chat or have a quick answer to a question, 45%, now I think this last month, are already been answered only by the chatbot. So it doesn't have to go to a live person to handle through chat or live talk.And that is creating some nice efficiencies, and we're able to increase the productivity of our payroll specialist and across the board actually. So where actually the chatbot stuff and the work that's automated response is going much faster. And I said, given the millions of clients and employees -- client employees that we have using this, the machine learning is really creating things very quickly. Last month, we had a month and a half ago, we had about 45 answered by the chatbot, different questions that it would expect.Now it's over 100 because of the machine learning piece of that. So -- -- And if I can build on that, part of it's a productivity player, but another part is serving the client better. And so at the end of the day, when you combine that technology with our world-class service capability, you got a pretty powerful service differentiator. So we're pretty excited about where we're at. -- Great. And can you just quickly clarify the drag from Oasis expansion in fiscal '20 roughly? -- Yes, Jim. So if you look at the page where I put the -- or what we put on the IR presentation there, you can do the calculations to get there. You'll see what the impact is. I would say this, the drag year over year is, from an EBITDA perspective is modest.And I would say, also from an operating margin perspective, when you go through the calculations, you can call me later on that to make sure you got it, it's not dramatic.Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Wolfe Research. -- I guess, just to start, if you could just help us understand the $20 million range. Just what's keeping you from having a little more visibility, I guess, into the contribution from Oasis in the fourth quarter? And then some thoughts on cost and revenue synergies over time? And any signs you may be able to accelerate the upselling part of your payroll base, just given the acquisition of Oasis? And how much will you reinvest and whatnot into the sales force? -- So if you look at it, you have line of sight to what to was in Q3. I've given you a number that's pretty clear. I think it can get through where we think we're going to land. So I'm reticent to keep changing guidance because we're falling within the range.And I think at this point, I called out what I thought the contribution for the back half of the year is going to be. If you look in the presentation, we've detailed what Oasis was for the quarter, about $70 million. I've detailed what it is for Q4. I think we've given a pretty clear road map in terms of what we think it will be for the balance of the year. -- Perfect. Yes, I understood that you just didn't want to change it there. Just commenting on the cost and revenue synergies over time, if you don't mind? -- Yes. I think from a cost standpoint, I think, a lot of it we've actually already started. There was some synergies of duplication of people. Some of that's already been done.And I think we're pretty much far down on the road on that one. We also are looking at, obviously, from a cost standpoint, what can we do with the carriers to get better cost and plans is in place. And we'll be working those through. It's a little bit early on that one, but we're working through that right now.Organization is in place, and the product strategy is working through right now. I don't see a lot of needs of technology investment that needs to be done there right now. So that should be pretty solid. Sales team is pretty clear on who's got what already, that's in place.And I think, so the cost synergies will, again, be people but pretty much done; insurance carriers and rates there to lower our cost; efficiency and, frankly, handling; and I guess, I'd say, on the revenue side, selling more obviously and being able to capture some retirement products in there and more insurance. To the degree we couldn't underwrite them, we drive them to our insurance agency like we do for our PEO. That's something that Oasis did not have before either and now will be able to use. So we haven't laid out all the quantification, I think, in the guidance you see kind of overall where we think it's going to be.And frankly, the short-term impact is pretty moderate to the EPS. So we feel pretty good about the margins and everything there. -- OK. And then just more generally, real quick, I mean, I know your focus is obviously shifting toward PEO, and it's becoming increasingly important given the ACA and the 50-employee insurance mandate, etc. Just could you give any numbers or just an idea just on how much white space you see out there? And what percent of the addressable market is unpenetrated right now? And just kind of talk to your longer-term strategy in the space going forward, whether it's around M&A or organic growth, etc.? -- Well, yes, I think it's going to be both. I mean, primarily organic growth, but we'll continue to look for opportunities like Oasis and other PEOs. And it really it looks like more of an HR outsourcing opportunity because what's changed is, a few years ago, the average client size that needed HR, needed retirement and those things was, I would say, 25, 30 employees plus. That has come down pretty dramatically.As you've seen the states increased their regulations, Fed may have come down a bit, but the states have really increased the enforcement and the regulations that they have on things like immigration and whether your workers are legit or not, the need for retirement plans, all that has been pushed up and a lot of requirements, and the enforcement has picked up, where they're looking for revenue from these and enforcements. So the need for HR has really grown. So I think, look, there's a lot of white space there. There's a lot of opportunity.And it's growing as well. And so you have to be someone, who through your technology and your service, can give that kind of complete set. So not only are you helping on a tough -- on a low unemployment market, the first thing you hear constantly in our surveys is I need help recruiting and retaining employees because it's so tough out there to get them. So you have to offer benefits of a large company, but you're a small or mid.You have to offer benefits. You have to offer mobility options, so people can do things. 70% of our clients' employees expect that they should be able to do everything on their phone, they don't want to talk anyone in HR, they don't want to go online, they want every to read -- certainly, not on paper, they want to do everything mobile. And that's all the products that we've been introducing and linking together for a total HR experience.So that helps you bring in employees, and it helps you retain and develop your employees, so that they stay. And that's exactly what we're responding to. Like retirement, signing up retirement used to be a heavy paper-intensive process for your employees who want a retirement plan, you push it out there, it's all paper, it's tough to do. You now can have an employee set up their retirement in four clicks on our mobile app.So you're making the small and midsized business more competitive and helping them continue to retain those employees as well. -- The other thing, James, I'd say is, and maybe I'll publish you some data on this, but if you look at the 20 and above space and the amount of worksite employees, which is probably the best way to dimension the opportunity, you're in the multiple tens of million of worksite employees. If you take the top four PEOs, you barely get to two million worksite employees. Now there are more worksite employees serviced by smaller PEOs. But when you compare that to the amount of worksite employees that exist in 20 and above, which is we're in now, and may in the future be 10 and above, we're at the sweet spot of PEO because you have a significant amount of white space.And the penetration rate is in the low single -- is in the single digits, mid to low single digits.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. -- I just wanted to continue the discussion on the PEO space. Are you going to market differently with your Oasis product versus your legacy Paychex product? -- I would say, in the short term, probably a little bit differently just because of the brand and so forth, and we're working through that now. But the packages, what you would say is, Oasis has gone more into, obviously, brand-new clients that have not been on a PEO or any other service. With our base, we're working through the client base as well. So we have a team that sells into the client base, who has that need and can graduate, I guess, I'd say, to a PEO.And Oasis and the rest of the team is selling brand-new clients to the PEO or HR concepts. So a little bit different there. We'll be fixing the brand as we work through what's the best way to approach that. But generally, they're both selling, ""Hey, this is an HR support package that is there.Whether you take the insurance through us or whether we underwrite it through the agency, you have full retirement and payroll and HR administration packages."" And so, I would say, at a high level, it's certainly is being marketed the same way because that's the need of the client that we see out there. -- OK. I know during the last recession, this was a relatively small piece of the business. I'm not even sure if Oasis was even around then. But can you give us your expectations of what you think might happen to this business, if God forbid, we go into any type of downturn in the U.S.? -- Well, I think, from an HR standpoint, sometimes in a recession, you need HR support more than ever. Certainly, on the small business side, that's only payroll. For example, you have small businesses, more of them go out of business, and few of them start up. So you always have some hits there.But I think by expanding and really becoming much more of an HR company and having retirement offerings, insurance offerings and a much more complete package, that makes us much more resistant to a downturn in the economy. And that's the way we looked at it for the last few years as we've positioned the company to be much more of an HR outsourcing company than just payroll. That's because that is actually more in need in those difficult times. Now you need much more HR decisions to say, ""Hey, what do I do with pay increases? What do I do with insurance offerings? How do I cut costs but keep my people?"" That's when you need the personalized HR support that we give with over 500 HR generalists.At the same time, the technology, frankly, will make you more efficient as our clients are. Our clients are becoming much more efficient because of our mobile app that they use now, that if a client employee now needs to change their address in the system, in the old days, they'd go to their HR person or their business owner, they'd have to call us, they would talk to us they would change it. They don't do anything now. Now they say to the employee, you can change it yourself.You can go on your mobile app and do everything basically. So all those things, the technology changes, the HR focus, the total package, that makes us really more resistant and stronger in a recession-type era. -- So just to build on what Marty said, if you look at from a product standpoint, obviously, that's sticky. From a client size standpoint, you have more resilience because clients typically are larger in a PEO. So in our payroll, if you're payroll only, you tend to be smaller PEO clients or in a higher-sized bucket, which gives them a little bit more ability to withstand a downturn in the economy.Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. -- My first question is related to the e-commerce capability describing for SurePayroll. Can you just talk a little bit more broadly is there a big like digital marketing push accompanying this? So the concept being to get the small business owner over the weekend or whatever sort of Google searching and end up finding Paychex and SurePayroll and being able to onboard entirely independently. Can you just give a little bit more color around like where this is headed? Yes. -- Yes, it is. It's actually a continuation of -- what we saw was, with lead generation, we're doing a much stronger job with getting the leads in and typically, it's more of a form fill out, right? And then we get back to them, where the client contact is somehow through the lead and says, get back to me. Well, the hardest thing to do is get back to a client today, get anyone to answer the phone. So what we found with e-commerce is not only is it responsive to a client the way they want to set themselves up, when they want to do it, weekend, nights or whatever, but also that you've captured that lead because now you don't have to get back and the client will start themselves.They'll compare, they'll see the price, they'll see the product, they decide to buy, they're in the mix. And even if they get halfway into it and need help, that's fine. We have someone ready at all times to be able to just go to someone either through a chat or a direct line and talk to them to help them through the process. But you've captured them now as opposed to trying to reach back to them.And that has been one of the strongest findings through the e-commerce is, lead generation is great, but closing that lead at the time that the prospect wants to close it is huge. So that's been the biggest benefit of this thing. -- And I'd say that it's not in the future. We launched in Q2, and it's up and running. -- Yes, yes. -- OK. And then on a related note around the investments around technology that you've been talking about, when they evolve, given initiatives under way that are leveraging your underlying database of employment-related data, I mean, so you can feed back things like benchmarks or give guidance and advice? Yes? OK. -- Yes. They have already been released. So -- and given the size of our client base and employees of our clients, that can give great data. So we give data, for example, on turnover.And there obviously, it's at a gross basis kind of pulled together. But it can do it by size as well, size of clients or size of your business and so forth. So yes, we're giving data analytics. Something that's been very important to our clients, to get data analytics.And most small to midsize businesses could never get at that data or ever pay for that data in the market that we can give them very quickly using our very large client base. -- OK, great. And then just last one, Marty. Can you just summarize -- you always give really good color around the macroeconomic indicators you see in your business that give you a sense for the overall health of the economy. Can you just run through those, meaning employment growth, wage growth, the new business formation, etc.? -- Yes. I think what we've seen in the small business indexes is really focused on 50 employees and below. And what we've seen is, obviously, job growth has kind of flattened out here the last few months. Most of that is because there aren't the people out there to hire.So we're still seeing job growth, but the change in job growth is it has really flattened out to last year, down a little to flat. And we're seeing it kind of across all sectors. You are seeing wage growth probably in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, which has been good. It's coming up.And of course, those earning the least are getting the biggest increase. So they're seeing -- those earning minimum wage, etc., because of the minimum wage increases across the country are seeing 3.5% to 4% wage increase, sometimes a little bit more, where salaried or the higher-wage earners are seeing 2% or below 2% is what we're seeing, and that's kind of averaging out. Across all sectors in jobs, manufacturing kind of has been up and down but is down a bit now. Construction is still probably one of the better ones.Other services overall is the strongest, which is discretionary services. There are more part-time jobs. So again, you're seeing a little bit more growth there and a little bit more wage increases there because of the minimum wage changes. Overall, it feels steady, not necessarily heading -- it doesn't feel like it's heading into a recession.It's just job growth has kind of flattened out because it's tough to find people. What we are seeing also is -- hearing from our clients anecdotally that there is more of those on the fringe that may be high school graduates instead of college that they're bringing in and training more. So again, for our products, it's helpful because they're looking for more training, bring people on that they may not have hired before but trying to train them because it's so difficult to find people. And we actually have heard, on the negative side, probably some businesses are saying, ""Hey, I'm not taking some work because I can't find enough people to do it."" More in the trade and that kind of thing.And regionally, it's in the south that's still the strongest. Energy has picked back up, so Houston, Tex and Dallas look better. And of course, the Florida-Georgia, generally, that area is better for construction in both residential and commercial.Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. -- I just want to follow up on the workers comp part of the insurance. How big is that versus kind of health insurance in terms of the importance for your insurance business? And can you elaborate a little bit more on the issue? Is it just a down pricing market? Or is there, there are more happening there, I guess? -- So two parts, Tim, and I want to make sure that it's clear, when we say PEO and insurance and we call out softness in workers comp, we're calling out, specifically, the workers comp revenue in our insurance agency. We're not specifically referring to PEO workers comp, which is a separate conversation. That really is around the -- that's a separate discussion. So roughly half of our insurance business is workers comp premiums.And if you look at where we are this year and you look at PEO and insurance, insurance is about 30% of that number, a little bit less than that. It will go to 20% in terms of composition of that revenue. When you look at then insurance and disaggregate that part, about half workers comp, half health and benefits. Health and benefits is doing fine, upper single-digit growth and growing reasonably.And workers comp is where we've seen softness really starting a couple of quarters-or-so ago and accelerating. And the workers comp market goes through cycles. So if we have had this discussion a couple of years ago, we would have said, ""Hey, workers comp is doing great. Premiums are up, and we're getting our share."" Now we're getting our share, but the market is soft.And when it turns, who knows? But it goes through cycles, and we're going through a bit of a softening cycle now. -- OK. Fair enough. And can I follow up on the comment on the selling season? I guess, it sounded like obviously, it's good overall result, but it sounded much more about selling the broader bundle of services than necessarily client growth and, in particular, I guess, your legacy payroll businesses. Is that accurate, I guess? And can you elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of ability to grow the client base for that core kind of payroll suite of services? -- Tim, Marty can provide color commentary on the selling season. I would just caution that to infer that we weren't saying something about unit growth is not a correct assumption. -- Yes. -- And obviously, we don't give the client base per se. But I would say, generally, we came into the year expecting that the client base would grow, and we haven't been disappointed. So that's what I'd say about unit growth, and Marty can talk a little bit about the selling season. -- Yes. I think maybe what threw you off a little bit there, I mean, we had solid sales growth across the board in the first half of the year. In the third quarter, there was some moderation on the payroll side, but we still probably are -- when you look overall, we had our best par growth in three years, I'd say, and certainly year to date and in that selling season overall. I think on the small business payroll side, I think it was impacted by some things that happened there, but I think we had still good sales, particularly on the inside sales piece.And we would expect to see the HRP stronger because that's what we're pushing the most. Even on the payroll side, even small business payroll sales folks are leading with the complete package now. We just found that's what the clients were looking for. So I think it was a decent selling season, and it has continued where we've been through the year as good solid growth yearover-year in par. -- OK. And just one follow-up to that, when you said the inside sales team, is that mostly SurePayroll and then sub-10 type of employee? Or what's the end market that's served by that's a part of the sales force? -- Yes. What I mean by -- yes, I'm sorry. Our inside sales is not just SurePayroll. It's a pretty good-sized Europe sales team, which we've been increasing.And they handle, frankly, all products as well but the way they sell everything inside. And they take a lot of the leads, particularly in the small, and they take a lot of the leads that come over the web but will sell all products over the phone.Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan. -- Just a couple of quick ones. On the worksite employee front, is it fair to think that units are growing faster than the 17% given lower pass-throughs, and so it declines and some of the other pressures. It seems like, every year, WSEs are growing at a good pace. -- WSEs are growing, I would say, in the range, Tien-Tsin. If we were in the quarter, it's comparable, I would say. It's a little bit actually below but in that range. -- OK. Now, strong nonetheless then. OK. Then secondly, just on SurePayroll, do you feel like you've narrowed the gap versus some of the, call it, the Silicon Valley guys on the distribution front? Forget about the product, I know you've talked a lot about product, but just on the distribution side, do you feel like you've narrowed the gap there? -- Yes. I don't think -- yes, I mean, I think the gap was wider on how much better we were than them. So I guess, we've narrowed it all. But yes, I think we compete very effectively with the kind of the West Coast that are out there.I think pricing-wise, we've come up with some new ways to price as well and to capture that client through things like e-commerce that we've been talking about. So yes, I think we're very competitive with them. And frankly, I've seen excellent productivity and sales out of those teams. They've done very well.And the e-commerce, I think as Efrain mentioned as well, is really taking off. -- Tien-Tsin, mashing up your question with Tim's, increasingly, to understand the business, you have to go at it in a multichannel approach. You have to figure out what the right blend of feet on the street is, internal telesales and then web-based e-commerce sales. And I would say, the third piece of that trifecta was the e-commerce space sales. SurePayroll has given us that capability, and it looks like that opportunity may be additive to the other channels, not necessarily a substitute for the other channels.So we're looking at the results. We've got real-time data showing us, and increasingly in the future, to be successful selling not just payroll, but HR, too, you've got to have a capability in all three of those channels, both over the web, direct, without a sales person; field-based sales for the right kind of client; and internal telesales. And our competitors are also playing with that mix to try to figure out what makes sense. I think you need to have all three pieces of them.We have the pieces in place now. We're in the process of fine tuning each of those three pieces.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. -- Lots of things that you're doing. I've got a ton of questions, but I'll limit it to a couple. Just with regards to just what you're doing on the e-com sales, what percentage of the SurePayroll sales are now coming through that channel? -- Well, it's pretty small. We started in the last quarter -- well, in second quarter. And so it's still pretty small. But I think it's going to be growing pretty substantially.And as Efrain said, I think he made – Efrain made a very good point there that it is, we think, in addition. So this is -- it's capturing that lead that's coming in when somebody's ready to buy right at that time and doesn't want a callback. And so I think, we're expecting that this will be in addition to kind of the other channels that we've had. -- And so I imagine you're going to end up extending it across-the-board in terms of offering this. -- That would be very likely, yes. Yes. -- OK, great. And then with regards to just micro segmenting the payroll in the HCM market. Can you describe the different dynamics? When you're taking a look at the growth that you're seeing right now, we've traditionally talked about different sub-segments, whether it's truly small sub-six employees versus 6 to 20 versus slightly higher and then getting into MMS. Where are you seeing the strongest growth? -- So I would say, in part, because of these technology advances, Mark, we're seeing strong growth in the micro segment. I think we're seeing reasonable growth in the, and I'm going to call it, the 5 to 50 segment. And then midmarket, modest, I would say, at this point but largely and due to the fact that the level of competition there is very high. We'd add one thing though.If I now say, let's talk about client segment instead of by product and payroll but by client size, now what we see is that 20 and above is increasingly fragmenting into an MMS market and a PEO market. And on the PEO side, we're doing very, very well. So if you think about PEO's comprehensive outsourcing -- you were just with NSP, I saw your note. If you look at what's happening in that market, it's pretty clear that there is a trend in the market toward comprehensive outsourcing.And what we're seeing 20 and above is exactly the same thing. So in our system, we either are going to go with that client with potentially an MMS rep or in our midmarket rep or through a PEO, and in some cases, we incentivize them to cross-pollinate. And we're seeing a lot of success on the PEO side. So I think that's a bit of an overview.I think PEO increasingly needs to be overlaid with when you talk about midmarket because it's a solution that midmarket clients are interested in. -- Yes. That probably makes sense. I've been covering the PEO since the late 90s, so it's interesting to see the acceleration and the increased interest. When we factor in Oasis, just on the operating margin, because our callback is a little bit later and so I hope you'll indulge me on this.But we're scratching it out, and it looks to us like maybe the implication would be like around 30 -- so we're seeing 37% or 38% ex Oasis, maybe 37-ish, and maybe that comes out to more like 35 to 37. Is that with Oasis? Is that in the ballpark? -- Mark, you have a very sharp pencil. Your overall, you can look at it. I won't call it out specifically. But if you do the math, you're not incredibly far off, but I would caution one thing -- -- It's Greg and I. -- I'm sorry. I would say, increasingly, we think about the business also from an EBITDA margin perspective, too. So we've given you all the pieces there to calculate. We've also called out what we expect EBITDA margin to be next year.And there's not a lot of strange adjustments. It will be very clear on the face of the cash flow statement and net income to get to a margin number, but that's what I'd say about that. And very, very preliminary. -- And from a really longer-term perspective, there's two different dynamics that are occurring. One is you're early on in terms of the implementation of some of these efficiency measures as it relates to chatbots and everything that that can end up doing from an efficiency and a service model perspective, which would obviously increase margins. On the flip side, we've got adding PEO, it's growing faster. So from a mix perspective, that's going to drive the margins down.How do we think about the balance of those two from a longer-term investor expectation perspective? -- So Mark, I guess, I would say two things on that. One is assuming the current mix, when we get through the four-year of Oasis, we would expect to come into 2021 improving EBITDA margins off the 20 base. So that would be our expectation. Caveating it, as I've been saying for 18 months, that if PEO growth accelerates even faster than we anticipate, which is still good teens growth, then that could impact that perspective.The other thing that could impact it is, I called out, management solutions. The management solutions growth in that area because it carries a higher margin, it would be an offset. But I think those are all the factors that as you plug in the model, you'd have to evaluate. -- Great. And then Marty, one last one. Just the client scores with regards to the clients that are being serviced through the chatbots. How is that trending relative to more traditional? -- Yes, very good. We look at it from a number of ways. We don't always get them to do enough client sat, but you get to that or they're getting it. We watch this very closely.I just had a meeting on this earlier this week. How many of the questions are answered in the first question that they ask. How many are going to a service provider because they're not getting the answer. And that's being refined all the time.What we're seeing is that increase from 40% are being answered by the chatbot itself, now up to 45% in just a month. And I think if we look out three months or six months from now, I think that would be -- we're hoping that that is quite a bit higher. And that's an indication to us that they're getting their answer. Now we also have other feedback channels.And so far, we're getting good feedback that the answer is being there. And again, you start with 30 questions, then it goes to 50. Now we're over 100 because of the machine learning part of that of refining the question and understanding the natural language of what's the client asking for, what are they really asking for and are we responding with the right answer. So it's pretty early, but at this early stage, to have 45% answered by the chatbot itself is very strongly, we think.So we're getting good, positive feedback on that.Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. -- I wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. First, on Oasis, you made it pretty clear that you're tracking pretty close to what you'd thought. What should we look at as the potential, most likely sources of variance, either positively or negative, things that you're tracking that we should be aware of that could cause some variance there? And then just a follow-up question quickly on the chatbot comments from the last question. It sounds like you're improving the response rate pretty nicely.What's your sense and what are your systems people telling you as kind of an ultimate ceiling for the chatbots at least within a reasonable time frame? -- Yes. I'll start with that one. I think it's around -- it's still really pretty early. You don't get a lot of great data on this.But I think if we could get 70% long term, if you could get 70% answered by the bot by itself, I think that's pretty strong based on today's standards. So having only been in it pretty early, heading toward 50%, we feel really good about it. And you do get an awful lot of data. Given our use of it, we're able to change it pretty quickly and enhance it based on the number of people that are using it.So I think it's heading toward -- I think it would be good to head toward a 60%, 70% response because there's always nuances that people may want to talk to a live person. But that is changing pretty rapidly. This is really in response to the way the client doesn't, as you'd probably know, most younger clients, in particular, don't want to talk to somebody. They'd just soon chat and if it's a chatbot that gives the answer.And by the way, this is going to expand pretty dramatically to taking you, not only answering your question but saying, ""Do you want me to take you there?"" So, ""Hey, where do I find my check stub?"" It's here, today. Now it says, it's here, go here. Next, it'll be, ""Let me take you there by hitting this."" And if the question is how do I do something, it will evolve to video, short streaming video that will show you in 30 seconds or less, this is how you do it or you can contact somebody. So that will all continue to evolve the way the client needs it.First question? -- Yes. On Oasis, I think that we have a pretty good handle now on both revenue and expenses in the business. There are targets that we have set internally in terms of cost savings that we're measuring against the business. They're comprehensive, at least the framework that we gave you.So we'll be looking at that. And obviously, a success winning client is an important part of the equation as we head into next year.Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. -- A real quick housekeeping question on the preliminary outlook for fiscal 2020. What are your interest rate assumptions on the funds held? -- I'm sorry. Say that again? -- Interest rate assumptions in 2020. -- Oh, interest rate assumptions. Matt, we didn't include them, in part, because we need to see where the Fed is at this point. But we would assume that there really are not going to be rate increases there. So you'd see some modest increase on our client -- our interest on funds held for clients at this point.That's what we think is a more likely scenario. Hopefully, we don't end up in a scenario where it goes the other way. But we tend to doubt that that's what's going to happen. -- That's right. That makes a lot of sense. I know you've been asked a bit about some of the sort of Silicon Valley start-up competitive dynamic already. And in previous calls, you've been asked more pointedly about Square, and I think just because they're a well-known name, it comes up a lot in discussions.Is that something that you're seeing more or hearing about more? Or is this still kind of a different market with respect to your kind of customer base and your targets and they're through kind of micro merchant addressable market? -- Well, I think, Matt, some of the market is the same. But we haven't seen or heard much from that. Like they announced getting into the payroll. It was more a payroll mobile app, but it was only for employers, for example, and I think it's still that way.There is not an employee e-mobile app. And that was -- and frankly, something like that. So it got a lot of press. I think that's as far as they went or at least the last that we've see.And the employee piece is really the biggest piece of the mobile app, and we feel like we have a very competitive mobile app with a five-star kind of rating at this point. So we're feeling very good that that's very competitive. And we have not seen any takeaways or any real feedback of people leaving to go to Square. I think it rounds out their product set from a credit card and processing standpoint, but we have not seen someone who's going to go there necessarily for payroll and a mobile payroll app.That's only for the employer. -- Got it. So they're probably hunting more within their own existing merchant client base as opposed to the greenfield opportunities out there more broadly where you're a lot more established. -- Yes, I think so. And that plus, I think anyone who would look at that, even though you may have your processing through them, I think if anybody was really looking for an app that provided a full feature employer and employee access and gave the full features of retirement and payroll and HR administration, all on the app, I don't think there would be any comparison, so.Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank. -- Thank you for all the detail, including on 2020. I wanted to kind of get into your statement on introducing the discussion on EBITDA margin, as well as saying that you're now thinking of the business more on the EBITDA basis. Is that a comment on future capital allocation, use of cash? Should we sort of maybe combining that with the comment on low PEO penetration, it implies more Oasis-type deals. How should I think of that? -- Yes. I think, to some degree, as Efrain mentioned in his comments, that does make some sense to the fact that amortizations and so forth. We want to make sure that it's very clear where the margins really are because of the PEO business and sometimes the impact on operating margins versus EBITDA margins from an acquisition type of standpoint. So I think you're certainly right on that, and Efrain, I think, mentioned that.But on a go forward basis, we're certainly looking very much on organic growth and combining the strength. Here, we bought the largest private PEO in the business, and we feel like that integration is going very well. And so will we continue part of Oasis' plans or to continue rollups of other PEOs to add more strength through their offerings, and we'll look at continuing to do that. Will it be the size of Oasis? Not really because there's no one out there of that size.But I think that their strategy of rolling up and was part of ours as well will probably continue. -- Got it. And just switching gears a bit, as your existing client employees sort of go through the current tax filing process in the tax season, are you beginning to maybe see a change in withholding? Is there potentially maybe a surprise with their returns and so on? Or is it too early to tell? Any comment on future withholding patterns? -- I think we haven't really seen it yet. I think it might be a little bit too early until the filing date of April, even though people file early. I think they are -- you do get anecdotal evidence that certainly people are looking at it and asking a lot of questions of their tax preparers, like how do I avoid this next time? And how do -- and so probably, we would expect to see withholdings go up a little bit and, therefore, probably the cash balance is up a little bit. But it's a little bit early to see that just yet. -- Got it. And last question is, it's been asked a couple of different ways, the digital option that you spoke about. And you mentioned that you might be seeing a demand for this in other parts of your tech stack. Can you talk about how you're thinking of the level of future tech investments, as well as whether this mix will rethink your sort of your traditional sales force process? -- Well, I think, you're talking more of the e-commerce. But I mean, overall, we're always looking, as Efrain said, like even the sales -- well, the sales process is definitely -- it has been changing. And I feel like we've been changing and, to some degree, a few years ago, catching up now. I feel like we're in pretty good shape with the lead and demand gen investment that we use from some of the tax reform money in the last year to 18 months.We really have found how to capture much more data on client even searching for Paychex, how to get more of those leads. And also how to deal with leads that need to be nurtured, as we would say. So they're not ready to buy yet, but you don't just lose those. You put them in a process, where they're nurtured, and I'm sure you're aware of this, white papers on HR, and you build the credibility of paychecks.So when they are ready to buy, they're right there. So the increase and the way we've handled this from a digital process and a much more defined data analytics is much stronger than ever. We've been very good on the data analytics for using our client data that say when someone might have an issue or might be ready to leave us or something like that, but this lead generation has gotten a lot tighter. And then the next-generation -- the further generation of that is this e-commerce platform, it's sure right now, which we also found that the leads may be great, we may be able to get ahold of a lot more prospects, but it's hard -- but we may get a lot more prospects, but it's really hard to reach them.And so e-commerce allows them to come in, decide and select and start going down the process. And that is a much more powerful tool, probably than we even expected as far as capturing new leads. So we're constantly looking at this. The data collection and data analytics is becoming such a bigger part of the service model and the sales model.And I feel like we've got the right people on it and the right tools in place. -- And the other part of that question on the absolute level of tax spend? -- I think, well, we're at a pretty good kind of percentage of revenue, and we kind of stick to that. I think we had, obviously, an enhancement to that last year, but we feel like we can get back to a pretty levelized level of tax spend, and we're doing pretty good with that. We've also found ways to be more productive in the tech side as well and what our spend is by how we're doing some of that.Your final question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. -- Listen, I know we're closing in on 90 minutes here, so just three real quick ones. First, if you look at organic PEO growth in fiscal '19, can you help disaggregate the kind of WSE growth versus insurance and any other pricing dynamics that may be impacting growth? -- When you say impacting growth, what do you mean, David? I'm not sure -- -- Well, I'm just trying to disaggregate, I think, this over 17% of organic growth? -- Yes. So we've seen teens growth in revenue. I called out on the script where we are in terms of PEO and insurance growth. When you look at the PEO, again, growing in the teens.Worksite employees, growing in the teens. Some quarters, we've been a little bit above. Some quarters, a little bit below. But you're getting the contributions coming from the fact that you're getting good worksite employee growth, not necessarily because of pricing or add-ons from pass-through, so I'd say that.When you disaggregate a little bit of the change in the growth rate that I called out, it really is a function of the fact that the insurance portion of PEO and insurance is growing more slowly than the PEO. And then we've got this drag that really is more of a second half of the year -- second half of the year event that will be persistent to -into next year, and it could change, markets change. But if you look at the underlying PEO, we expect it to grow in the teens, and we would expect worksite employee growth to grow comparable, that's excluding Oasis. Including Oasis, the growth rate comes down a little bit just simply because it's a larger business.The low of large number starts to take place. And we expect to get a combination of both worksite employee growth and new client growth to drive the growth that's embedded in the outlook that we gave. -- All right. Great. And just following up in terms of the composition of the PEO, I mean, obviously, two significant acquisitions in the last year and a half or two years. Can you give us just a sense of what the PEO looks like today, excluding the ASO? For example, I know you report a combined WSE number.Can you give us a sense for what PEO is, excluding ASO? And what your mix is between white and blue gray? And also, what your at-risk kind of percentage of insurance businesses? -- Yes. OK, good. Three compound -- that's a one -- that counts for three, David, but OK, I'll answer it. So the first thing is, look, our client base is blue gray or gray blue, less white and more gray blue.And obviously, we want the composition of that base to moderate more gray over time than simply blue. So we'll look at that. That has a lot of implications as you know because you know the industry very well in terms of rates of healthcare attachment and workers comp rates. But we feel we're in a good place there.If you look at where we are from a worksite employee perspective, I haven't disclosed it. But if you look at No. 1 and you know what that number is, and you know what No. 3 is, we're No.2, right in the middle of the two. So that will give you a sense of where we are from a worksite employee standpoint. And so we think in that space that Oasis has -- and I would come back to something Marty said earlier, in that space that the combination of the Paychex's PEO and also, HROI and Oasis occupy, there is a lot of opportunity there. And right now, our at-risk insurance and those nonguaranteed cost insurance is primarily limited to the Florida market, and everything else that -- so the only thing that we are reporting as pass-through revenue is the minimum premium revenues largely, the minimum premium revenues that we're collecting in Florida, which is a percentage.It's not half of the percent of what we sell on health insurance. It's a pretty carefully controlled amount of risk that we're taking. So if you look at everyone else in the industry, we occupy a middle ground between the position that the largest competitor takes, which is all apparently guaranteed cost and others that are all at-risk. We carefully control the amount of that risk insurance that we have. -- OK, got it. And then just finally in the spirit of abusing the time limit here, your workers comp comment, because of the blue gray composition, why isn't it that the workers comp dynamic in the insurance side of your business isn't impacting the PEO business as well? I would think more favorably, it being [Inaudible]. So what's going on? -- In the PEO, because you've got a bundle, you can offset the pieces of the bundle that you're selling. So in a steady state, right? You would have some impact, but the reality is, you're balancing that between the amount of healthcare insurance you're selling and the amount of workers comp that's attaching and also the amount of admin fees you're charging. Our PEO is a little bit different probably than anyone else in the industry. When we underwrite a PEO customer, we make a determination, do we want you in our risk pool? Because if we don't want you in our risk pool, we're going to send you to our insurance agency, and you're going to get priced that way.So we've got a little bit more control on the PEO side. And to the extent that we don't like the risk, we basically offset the -- we offload the risk to specialized carriers that don't mind dealing with that level of risk. So the net-net net of what I just said is, it really doesn't have much of an impact on the PEO side.Thank you. I will now return the call to Martin Mucci for any additional or closing remarks. -- Great. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days.Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third-quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex.

The stock market had a big bounce on Tuesday and started off higher on Wednesday as well. By lunchtime though, investors were staring at ~1% losses across the board, although they have since erased about half of those losses. What's going on out there? We remain in a messy, choppy market after the indices' big rally off the December lows. Let's look at what's moving in the market today and get an idea of what top stock trades to watch going through the rest of this week.Let's talk about the  (NYSEARCA:  ). This name has been a leader over the past few quarters, both on the upside and the downside. Earlier this month, the IWM put in a lower high from the month prior and failed to hold its 200-day moving average.It's now below the 50-day and 20-day moving averages as well. The setup is…not great. But that said, it's not like the rally is completely giving way. There are some negative catalysts working against stocks - like fears of a global recession - but the Fed remains patient and earnings aren't getting sacked.That, to me, limits our downside. However, that does not mean we're immune to a pullback and/or consolidation. Bulls may want to be a bit more cautious, at least until the IWM can recapture the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. I'm not a huge fan of the lower highs and lower lows, but that concern is only that, as long as we're over $145. (NASDAQ:  ) is down about 10% after a number of downgrades came in  .So far, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement for the 52-week range is holding up as support, but CRON is far from out of the woods. If this level fails, there could certainly be more downside.The prior breakout is down near $14 to $15, while the 50% retracement is at $15.06. So should CRON take out Wednesday's lows, this could be its destination down the road. Dip buyers need to use caution, especially with CRON below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages.A slightly higher open on Thursday followed by a decline that takes out Wednesday's low could give bears a low-risk short-term shorting opportunity.Shares of  (NYSE:  ) started off higher on the day, but faded from its opening gains after the company  . PAYX stock is now down almost 2% on the day.The report wasn't necessarily bad, but perhaps it wasn't enough to sustain new highs. Worth noting though, PAYX did make new 52-week highs in the session. That said, it's near channel resistance on the weekly chart.At the very least, bulls may wait for a pullback into the 20-week or 50-week moving averages. However, waiting for a potential test of the 100-week moving average and/or channel support has proven to be much more prudent. It also allows bulls to enter into a less risky setup should it get there. Patience may be key here with PAYX.Shares of  (NYSE:  ) are rallying despite the company cutting its capacity guidance. A stock rallying on bad news is a good sign for a possible bottom.In either case, bulls have a reasonable setup. So far, the stock is holding above the 200-week moving average. Should the stock lose this level the recent lows near $45, it will tumble into no man's land. $45 is a notable multi-year level, but there's potential uptrend support (purple line) near this level as well.Aggressive bulls can go long on a weekly close over the 200-week moving average. Conservative bulls may want to wait for a potential pullback. If it materializes, an entry near $45 sets up a low-risk long. (NASDAQ:  ) has been a  , but shares have been getting whacked over the past few sessions. Short-term uptrend support (blue line) didn't hold as support, nor did the 20-day moving average.That leaves the post-earnings open and the 50-day moving average near $170 on the table. Should these levels fail to hold, growth investors sure would love to snap this name up between $150 and $160.If you like mid cap growth stocks, TTD should surely be on your list. But keep in mind, it's a volatile one, so investors need a strong stomach.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@5 Top Stock Trades for Thursday: PAYX, IWM, CRON, TTD@2019-03-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-stock-trades-thursday-payx-iwm-cron-ttd-2019-03-27-0

Efrain? -- Thanks, Martin, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. [Audio gap] involve risk. Please refer to our earnings release that provides disclosure on forward-looking statements and related risk factors.In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measures include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and the investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the third quarter to their related GAAP measures. I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, then follow with some greater detail in certain areas.I'll touch briefly on year-to-date results and wrap with a review of our fiscal 2019 outlook and '20 framework. So look also at the investor presentation, we've got more detail there. Total revenue and total service revenue both grew 14% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively, our first $1 billion quarter and hopefully, the first of many to come. The acquisition of Oasis in December 2018 accounted for approximately one half of the growth in service revenue.Expenses increased 13% for the third quarter to $641 million. The acquisition of Oasis contributed approximately 12% to this growth. Total expenses for the prior year three months ended February 28, 2018 included, as you'll recall, a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees and a one-time charge following the termination of certain licensing agreements. Total expenses, excluding Oasis and these one-time costs in their respective prior-year period, increased approximately 9% compared to last year.This 9% growth was primarily driven by increased headcount due to investments and sales force technology resources and operations to support the growth in the business. In addition, an increase in PEO insurance pass-through cost impacted the quarter. Operating income increased 16% to $429 million. Operating margin was 40.1% for the third quarter comparing to 39.4% for the same period last year.Adjusted operating income, which excludes the previously mentioned one-time charge in the prior-year quarter, increased 7%. And I just keep referring you back to both the presentations we posted on the investor presentation we posted on the website. It goes through an extensive detail, all of the callouts. Our effective income tax rate was 23.7% for the third quarter, compared to 1.1% for the same period last year.The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax reform in December 2017 resulted in a significant decline in the federal corporate statutory tax rate. In the third quarter last year, we recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $79 million from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities at this lower rate or at the new lower rate. In addition, during the third quarter last year, we recognized the fiscal year-to-date catch-up for the lower-blended effective tax rate applicable for the fiscal year. These two items resulted in the low 1.1% effective rate for the prior-year quarter.We anticipate that the effective tax rate before any discrete tax items will be approximately 24% for the full year of fiscal 2019. Again, I refer back to the investor presentation. Net income decreased 12% to 325% for the third quarter, primarily due to the significant tax impacts I just discussed, partially offset by the one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements also recognized in the last year's third quarter. Adjusted net income increased 3%.Adjusted net income as a non-GAAP measure that excludes the one-time charge related to termination of the licensing agreements, tax benefit, the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and excess tax benefits related to employees' stock-based comp, which we call out. However, this measure still incorporates the impact of the year-to-date catch-up for the lower-blended federal corporate statutory rate recognized in the third quarter last year, which is moderating the growth for the current period. Diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $0.90 for the third quarter, but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. These growth trends reflect the same factors as discussed for net income.And again, I refer you back to the investor presentation, which details it. I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management solutions revenue, which includes payroll service revenue, together with our HCM products, included in many of our product bundles, increased 4% to $802 million for the third quarter. Lessor contributed less than 1% to the growth.The remaining increase was driven primarily by growth in client bases across our HCM services and growth in revenue per check, which improved as a result of price increases, net of discounts. PEO and insurance. It increased 65% to $246 million for the third quarter. Excluding Oasis, PEO and insurance service revenue would have increased 17% for the third quarter.This growth was primarily driven by the continued strong demand for our combined PEO services, which, along with WSE growth, the worksite employee growth and our existing client bases, resulted in solid growth and in client worksite employees served. Our insurance service revenue benefited from growth and the number of health and benefits applicants. The rate of growth for insurance services was moderated by softness in the workers' comp market. As state insurance funds declined, we expect this trend and workers' comp revenue to persist, and we expect it to persist in the next year, more to follow on that.It will have a modest impact. Interest on funds held for clients. It increased 27% for the third quarter, $23 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down for the third quarter, primarily driven by the impacts of lower client employees' tax withholdings resulting from tax reform and client base mix, partially offset by wage inflation.Investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio currently has an average yield of 2.1% and an average duration of 3.1 years.Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the third quarter, up from 1.5% last year. Year-to-date results, let me briefly summarize where we've been for this nine-month period. Management solutions revenue is up 4%, PEO and insurance revenue increased 40%, 23% without Oasis and 17% organic. Interest on funds held for clients increased 28%, driven by interest rate increases, partially offset by the impact of a 2% decline in average invested balances.Total revenue, this includes obviously, Oasis, up 10%. Operating margins were 37.8%, tempered by accelerated investments in the business and growth in PEO direct insurance costs. Net income increased 4%, and adjusted net income increased 12%. Diluted earnings per share increased 3%, but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12%.Let's go through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $886 million as of February 28, 2019. We had a strong cash flow quarter, even though we utilized part of our cash to pay for the Oasis acquisition. Funds held for clients as of February 28, 2019 were $5.4 billion, compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018.Funds held for clients. As you know, very widely in a day-to-day basis, averaging $4.4 billion for the third quarter and $3.9 billion for the nine months. Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $10 million, compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018. Total stockholders' equity was $2.6 billion as of February 28, 2019, reflecting $604 million in dividends paid and $33 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months of fiscal 2019.Our return on equity for the past 12 months was up formidable 42%. Cash flows from operations were $1 billion for the nine months, an increase of 3% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and noncash adjustments, partially offset by working capital fluctuations, working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for the combined PEO business, it decrease in accrued liability balances in connection with the termination of certain licensing agreements in fiscal 2018. Now turning to 2019 guidance, I will discuss the guidance for full-year fiscal 2019.I'd remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic conditions. Continue with no significant changes, we maintained our guidance as provided last quarter, including the overlay on Oasis, which I'll talk about in a second. I will reiterate these guidance ranges and provide some color where applicable. And then just finally to remind everyone, I'll give the guidance first excluding any anticipated impact from the Oasis acquisition, then follow it with the anticipated impact of Oasis on our results.And I would say this, some of you have updated your models for the inclusion of Oasis, some have not, and so we thought that it made more sense and was better to be very clear to say, here's what our base guidance is and then the overlay of Oasis, so just remember that as I walk through this. So excluding Oasis, management solutions, expected to grow approximately 4%; PEO and insurance, anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%; interest on funds held for clients, anticipated to grow 20% to 25%; total revenue, anticipated to grow in the range of 6% to 7%; operating income as a percent of total revenue, anticipated to be approximately 37%; interest income, net, anticipated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million; the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019, expected to be approximately 24%; net income and diluted earnings per share anticipated to grow approximately 4%; adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both expected to increase in the range of 11% to 12%. We give the guidance this way so there can be no confusion as the fact that we're tracking exactly to the plan that we set at the beginning of the year, and don't blend or confuse the info on Oasis. So now let's talk about it when we include Oasis.It's anticipated, as we said previously, they have an incremental impact on total revenue in the range of $155 million to $175 million in fiscal 2019. As we've refined these numbers, we think that that number is going to be on the lower end of that range, in the low 160s. Excluding one-time cost related to the acquisition, Oasis is anticipated to have minimal impact on earnings per share. Now when we include one-time acquisition and integration costs, we anticipate the impact on diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.03 per share for fiscal 2019.And that's consistent with what we've said previously, a little more color on where we fall within that $155 million to $175 million, and that really has everything to do with the way we are looking at pass-through costs in that business. I'll provide you with a little additional color for the last quarter of the year. Consistent with how we guided on last quarter's call, we anticipate that management solutions revenue growth in Q4 will be below the full-year rate due to the anniversary, primarily, among other things, of the Lessor acquisition, we still think that management solutions will fall between 3% and 4%. Last quarter, we indicated that for Q3, we anticipated PEO and insurance services revenue increase in the range of 15% to 17% and for Q4 to be in the range of 10% to 13%.Growth in Q3 came in at the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter, and we now expect growth for Q4 to be approximately 9%, so below that range. There's two reasons for that, there was some timing of revenue that shifted between quarters on the insurance side. And despite this, we anticipate achieving our full-year guidance range. We'll talk a little bit more about what we're seeing as we talk about the '20 guidance, but there's also a little bit of softness on the workers comp portion of our insurance revenue that pulls that revenue down a bit.Now let me talk about the 2020, and I would just caveat everything I'm saying by saying that we haven't completed our planning process, but we thought, given the Oasis acquisition and the fact that you'll need to update models, we thought we'd give you some preview of what we're looking at for the year including Oasis. We'll provide detailed guidance during our fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter call as we always do. But let me give you some high-level commentary based on a preliminary look into next fiscal year. Management solutions revenue growth, we anticipate it to be comparable to the growth in 2019.PEO and insurance revenue, excluding Oasis, anticipated to reflect low double-digit growth, so that means about in the range of around 10%. Including Oasis, PEO and insurance services revenue growth will be in the range of 30% to 35% with growth higher in the first half of the year until the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition. Operating margins at this stage we think will be in the range of 37% to 38%. We'll see where we end this year, but that anticipates some improvement, some leverage on the base business.We anticipate Oasis will contribute revenue in the range of $355 million to $375 million next year, and it's going to be largely neutral to earnings per share. With the significance of the interest expense and the amortization expense associated with the Oasis acquisition, we introduced a discussion of EBITDA margins. Please refer to the investor presentation on our IR web page for the calculation of EBITDA for the first nine months of of fiscal 2019. We anticipate EBITDA for the full-year fiscal 2019 will be approximately 41%, and we expect EBITDA as a percent of total revenue for fiscal 2020 to be consistent with fiscal 2019.And if you look at the way we calculate EBITDA, it's pretty simple and should be pretty easy to follow. I reiterate that these comments are very preliminary and subject to revision as we finalize our plans for next year. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. By the way, I just wanted to clarify one thing that 37% to 38%, it's clear on the web page, that operating margin I cited would exclude Oasis.So look at the slide, it I think lays it out pretty clearly. So with that, I'll end my comments and turn it back to Marty. -- OK. Thank you, Efrain. And operator, now we'll open the call to questions, please.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. -- This is Damian on for Ramsey. Hoping you guys can talk a little bit about your long-term growth expectations for the PEO and insurance revenue, obviously, you'd provided that preliminary framework for 2020, which I really appreciate at the low double digits. But I think we were thinking about that more in like a mid-teens type of a rate. Can you maybe dissect what's going on in there? And why the declaration year over year? -- So the answer to that is, I gave you PEO and insurance. So our PEO business, our base PEO business is growing in the teens, insurance pulls that growth rate down a little bit. I would just say that insurance revenue can vary from year to year. It could very well be by the back half of next year, growth in insurance revenue picks up again.So it oscillates. Our PEO growth, we expect it to be in the teens. So that's one thing. And then the second thing is, we'll have to see when we anniversary Oasis, what our growth rate coming out of that will be because the numbers are larger.So I think that's the answer to the question. -- OK. And on the operating margin then for 2020. It's nice to see some of the leverage in the model there. Maybe if you could talk about some places that you guys are looking to invest next year or maybe in Q4 here and then into next year.Like what are the places that you guys are going to invest in? And how that kind of plays into your operating margin expectations? -- I would say that as we get into next year, we identified areas where we would invest this year as part of tax reform. And so there will be a continuation of those three broad buckets of investment. Not at the same level that we invested this year, certainly, on a net basis, meaning, we're getting some benefits from it, well, you won't see the same level of net spend that you saw this year. But we will continue to invest in marketing and sales, I think a little bit less in sales.And on the marketing side, continue to invest in operational efficiencies and then continue to work on IP and product. So Martin, you can go. -- Yes. One of the other things, as Efrain mentioned, those are the same things you'll see continuation of that and a little bit lower, but the product acceleration would be the other one that -- to the ones that Efrain mentioned. So lead generation, demand generation has been a big focus for us. A lot more leads coming in over the web.And I really think we're hitting our stride through some of the programs we put in place at the beginning of this fiscal year to drive more demand and then nurture those leads, because so many more are coming in that way and then handling them as well through internal sales. So we've really continued to invest there. Product acceleration, these were things that we were going to do. We accelerated, particularly, into this quarter, a lot of product around HR, what we call, our HR center and enhancing that with data analytics, learning management system to provide training for our employees and their clients and performance management among other things.So product acceleration, lead generation and operating efficiencies as well, using some of the work we've done and now chatbots and chat and other self-service capabilities that our clients we're looking for.Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- This is actually Amit Singh for Jason. You guys just went through the key selling season. So what were the key takeaways from there? Anything that stood out as being different this year versus, let's say, past couple of years in terms of competition, pricing, etc.? -- Yes. I think the competitive environment is about the same. We didn't see a big change there. We feel year to date, we're really seeing the best-selling seasons selling, frankly, in par growth that we've had in a few years.So that continued. I think it was moderated a little bit in January -- in the December, January kind of time frame, between the government shutdown, the market kind of dropping and then rebounding and etc. So we saw a little moderation there, but really when you look at the selling season overall for a par growth, we don't really give the number, but it's the best we've seen in three years, and certainly, year to date it's the same thing. So we're feeling great momentum, particularly, on the HR Solutions and PEO side of the business, insurances, health insurance and our inside sales piece as well. -- OK. And then just expanding on that competitive dynamics into your PEO market, and especially, as we look at your fiscal '20 guidance versus '19, there has been some strong growth for a while there, but is it now getting noticeably more crowded? -- Well, actually I think, we're building even more strength with adding Oasis and now serving through the various, not just PEO, but our other HR outsourcing solutions of 1.4 million worksite employees. We've built a real strength, and we expect to capitalize on that with carrier relations, the insurance carrier relations expanding into other states and selling our products into the Oasis base as well. So as Efrain said, I think, if you look at the whole PEO and insurance segment, it's moderated a bit, but a lot of that coming from the insurance side of it and particularly, workers' comp, which, I think, you know, cycles, working in a down-rate environment, which has actually picked up pretty quickly. And so once those state funds lower their insurance rates and the impact on the overall workers' comp rates have come down, that's really accelerated in the last couple of months.And that's going to put some moderation on the PEO and insurance line. But the PEO itself, we expect still to be very strong and particularly with the recent acquisition with Oasis, of course, and HROI as well. We feel very good about the leadership teams. They are the integration that's already under way.Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. -- I was wondering if you could maybe go a little bit further on the selling season commentary you had a minute ago, Marty. Just given what you've seen from Oasis thus far, what's been the reaction from clients with respect to the addition of that to your broad portfolio? And I guess, more broadly speaking, heading into fiscal '20, do you feel kind of incrementally better or worse about the growth in the kind of the core payroll franchise, revenue growth, heading into next year? -- Yes. I think, starting with the PEO, I think we've gotten good positive feedback from clients. I think Oasis already had a strong feeling from their clients and the leadership, Mark Perlberg, who has been running Oasis and is leading our PEO as we combine it. We're really designing a great balance of selling into new clients and selling into the base as well.Of course, we have a top 20 insurance agency that now Oasis can use the strength of that. So where insurance is not a good fit on the PEO model, you can now add Oasis clients as -- in new sales, like we've done, can now go to the insurance agency to be able to get insurance. So we're adding some strength there. Of course, they had different carriers, relationship levels than we did, and so we're expanding into new states.So I think the reaction has been good. The opportunity is great. And I think the integration is going very well from that standpoint. On the core payroll side, I think that competition has continued to be about the same.It's competitive. The pricing though hasn't changed a lot. I think we still have some pricing power there. Would always like to see that growth a little stronger, but that's also the way we're leading our sales now.We're leading much more with HR overall. So we're selling more bundles, we're selling more into the PEO and HR outsourcing. And you're not getting quite as much of the demand for payroll only and that's exactly how we expected it. So I think you're seeing price and level of competition the same there.It's OK. It's not as strong as we'd like, but I think it's moving exactly the way we thought toward more HR. Now on the SurePayroll side, for example, I mentioned that we just introduced an e-commerce option, we're seeing that that is helping not only accept more leads but gain more clients that way. It's early in the process.But what you're finding is, if a client comes in and can complete the entire transaction on their own or get help from our internal sales teams if they need it and kind of complete the whole thing in an e-commerce platform, that's pretty strong as far as capturing the client when they're looking, instead of getting a lead and then trying to reach the client, who may have decided to go to someone else because they couldn't talk to someone or complete the transaction. So I'm thinking we're seeing some positive growth there, and they're doing, and we are seeing some strong growth on the low end because of that. -- That's helpful. And then maybe relative to the margin outlook you're providing for fiscal '20. It looks like on an apples-to-apples basis, you're calling for margin expansion of a little bit over 50 bps, if I'm not mistaken. So I guess, could you maybe just kind of clarify relative to the reinvestments you've been making, do you feel like you have all the investment you need on the product side at this point to the extent that you're going to get incremental leverage off of that investment from here on out? And then maybe, Efrain, you can just clarify what the expected operating margin drag from Oasis will be for fiscal '20, roughly speaking. -- OK, so Jim, those are all interrelated. So you carefully pars what we said as usual. We said that this year's guidance, excluding Oasis, operating margins would be approximately 37%. And then the preliminary framework we're saying is between 37% to 38%, that would imply exactly what you would say.I would caveat one thing, Jim, that obviously, we could end up a little bit stronger than 37%, in which case the leverage will be a little bit less. But the premise to your question is valid. So what's happening is that, when we invested in year one, you don't see the benefits or the results of that investment in year one, you get into year two, you're continuing to invest, and you start to now get benefits from investments made in year one. That's why I carefully said, the net spend that we have relative to the investments we made after tax reform goes down, so you're seeing that in the margin.And the second thing before I turn it over to Marty, talk a little bit more about that, is to say that, when we think about what that spending has done and will do for us, it becomes a down payment for roadmap to the future where additional opportunities for leverage exist. Marty mentioned the investments we've made in things like that chatbots using AI NLP, machine learning, and not to be overlooked are things like the e-commerce developments we put into SurePayroll. And again, we are the first publicly traded company that has created that platform. So all of those now become things that we can leverage in the business to drive further efficiencies and in some cases, also in additional sales.So we're getting benefits. It's opening up other pathways that we hadn't considered. And that will be a benefit to us in the future. -- Yes. so I think Efrain's pretty much covered. The investments we made kind of from the tax reform that we talked about, starting really last year, was that that would do that from a product standpoint, we accelerated the product. In fact, a lot of that rolled out in the first two quarters and then in this quarter.From an HR center perspective, we're very happy with that that we were able to accelerate that. And then on the efficiencies, a lot of it has also been done to create those operating efficiencies. And the chatbot, for example, someone who wants to chat or have a quick answer to a question, 45%, now I think this last month, are already been answered only by the chatbot. So it doesn't have to go to a live person to handle through chat or live talk.And that is creating some nice efficiencies, and we're able to increase the productivity of our payroll specialist and across the board actually. So where actually the chatbot stuff and the work that's automated response is going much faster. And I said, given the millions of clients and employees -- client employees that we have using this, the machine learning is really creating things very quickly. Last month, we had a month and a half ago, we had about 45 answered by the chatbot, different questions that it would expect.Now it's over 100 because of the machine learning piece of that. So -- -- And if I can build on that, part of it's a productivity player, but another part is serving the client better. And so at the end of the day, when you combine that technology with our world-class service capability, you got a pretty powerful service differentiator. So we're pretty excited about where we're at. -- Great. And can you just quickly clarify the drag from Oasis expansion in fiscal '20 roughly? -- Yes, Jim. So if you look at the page where I put the -- or what we put on the IR presentation there, you can do the calculations to get there. You'll see what the impact is. I would say this, the drag year over year is, from an EBITDA perspective is modest.And I would say, also from an operating margin perspective, when you go through the calculations, you can call me later on that to make sure you got it, it's not dramatic.Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Wolfe Research. -- I guess, just to start, if you could just help us understand the $20 million range. Just what's keeping you from having a little more visibility, I guess, into the contribution from Oasis in the fourth quarter? And then some thoughts on cost and revenue synergies over time? And any signs you may be able to accelerate the upselling part of your payroll base, just given the acquisition of Oasis? And how much will you reinvest and whatnot into the sales force? -- So if you look at it, you have line of sight to what to was in Q3. I've given you a number that's pretty clear. I think it can get through where we think we're going to land. So I'm reticent to keep changing guidance because we're falling within the range.And I think at this point, I called out what I thought the contribution for the back half of the year is going to be. If you look in the presentation, we've detailed what Oasis was for the quarter, about $70 million. I've detailed what it is for Q4. I think we've given a pretty clear road map in terms of what we think it will be for the balance of the year. -- Perfect. Yes, I understood that you just didn't want to change it there. Just commenting on the cost and revenue synergies over time, if you don't mind? -- Yes. I think from a cost standpoint, I think, a lot of it we've actually already started. There was some synergies of duplication of people. Some of that's already been done.And I think we're pretty much far down on the road on that one. We also are looking at, obviously, from a cost standpoint, what can we do with the carriers to get better cost and plans is in place. And we'll be working those through. It's a little bit early on that one, but we're working through that right now.Organization is in place, and the product strategy is working through right now. I don't see a lot of needs of technology investment that needs to be done there right now. So that should be pretty solid. Sales team is pretty clear on who's got what already, that's in place.And I think, so the cost synergies will, again, be people but pretty much done; insurance carriers and rates there to lower our cost; efficiency and, frankly, handling; and I guess, I'd say, on the revenue side, selling more obviously and being able to capture some retirement products in there and more insurance. To the degree we couldn't underwrite them, we drive them to our insurance agency like we do for our PEO. That's something that Oasis did not have before either and now will be able to use. So we haven't laid out all the quantification, I think, in the guidance you see kind of overall where we think it's going to be.And frankly, the short-term impact is pretty moderate to the EPS. So we feel pretty good about the margins and everything there. -- OK. And then just more generally, real quick, I mean, I know your focus is obviously shifting toward PEO, and it's becoming increasingly important given the ACA and the 50-employee insurance mandate, etc. Just could you give any numbers or just an idea just on how much white space you see out there? And what percent of the addressable market is unpenetrated right now? And just kind of talk to your longer-term strategy in the space going forward, whether it's around M&A or organic growth, etc.? -- Well, yes, I think it's going to be both. I mean, primarily organic growth, but we'll continue to look for opportunities like Oasis and other PEOs. And it really it looks like more of an HR outsourcing opportunity because what's changed is, a few years ago, the average client size that needed HR, needed retirement and those things was, I would say, 25, 30 employees plus. That has come down pretty dramatically.As you've seen the states increased their regulations, Fed may have come down a bit, but the states have really increased the enforcement and the regulations that they have on things like immigration and whether your workers are legit or not, the need for retirement plans, all that has been pushed up and a lot of requirements, and the enforcement has picked up, where they're looking for revenue from these and enforcements. So the need for HR has really grown. So I think, look, there's a lot of white space there. There's a lot of opportunity.And it's growing as well. And so you have to be someone, who through your technology and your service, can give that kind of complete set. So not only are you helping on a tough -- on a low unemployment market, the first thing you hear constantly in our surveys is I need help recruiting and retaining employees because it's so tough out there to get them. So you have to offer benefits of a large company, but you're a small or mid.You have to offer benefits. You have to offer mobility options, so people can do things. 70% of our clients' employees expect that they should be able to do everything on their phone, they don't want to talk anyone in HR, they don't want to go online, they want every to read -- certainly, not on paper, they want to do everything mobile. And that's all the products that we've been introducing and linking together for a total HR experience.So that helps you bring in employees, and it helps you retain and develop your employees, so that they stay. And that's exactly what we're responding to. Like retirement, signing up retirement used to be a heavy paper-intensive process for your employees who want a retirement plan, you push it out there, it's all paper, it's tough to do. You now can have an employee set up their retirement in four clicks on our mobile app.So you're making the small and midsized business more competitive and helping them continue to retain those employees as well. -- The other thing, James, I'd say is, and maybe I'll publish you some data on this, but if you look at the 20 and above space and the amount of worksite employees, which is probably the best way to dimension the opportunity, you're in the multiple tens of million of worksite employees. If you take the top four PEOs, you barely get to two million worksite employees. Now there are more worksite employees serviced by smaller PEOs. But when you compare that to the amount of worksite employees that exist in 20 and above, which is we're in now, and may in the future be 10 and above, we're at the sweet spot of PEO because you have a significant amount of white space.And the penetration rate is in the low single -- is in the single digits, mid to low single digits.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. -- I just wanted to continue the discussion on the PEO space. Are you going to market differently with your Oasis product versus your legacy Paychex product? -- I would say, in the short term, probably a little bit differently just because of the brand and so forth, and we're working through that now. But the packages, what you would say is, Oasis has gone more into, obviously, brand-new clients that have not been on a PEO or any other service. With our base, we're working through the client base as well. So we have a team that sells into the client base, who has that need and can graduate, I guess, I'd say, to a PEO.And Oasis and the rest of the team is selling brand-new clients to the PEO or HR concepts. So a little bit different there. We'll be fixing the brand as we work through what's the best way to approach that. But generally, they're both selling, ""Hey, this is an HR support package that is there.Whether you take the insurance through us or whether we underwrite it through the agency, you have full retirement and payroll and HR administration packages."" And so, I would say, at a high level, it's certainly is being marketed the same way because that's the need of the client that we see out there. -- OK. I know during the last recession, this was a relatively small piece of the business. I'm not even sure if Oasis was even around then. But can you give us your expectations of what you think might happen to this business, if God forbid, we go into any type of downturn in the U.S.? -- Well, I think, from an HR standpoint, sometimes in a recession, you need HR support more than ever. Certainly, on the small business side, that's only payroll. For example, you have small businesses, more of them go out of business, and few of them start up. So you always have some hits there.But I think by expanding and really becoming much more of an HR company and having retirement offerings, insurance offerings and a much more complete package, that makes us much more resistant to a downturn in the economy. And that's the way we looked at it for the last few years as we've positioned the company to be much more of an HR outsourcing company than just payroll. That's because that is actually more in need in those difficult times. Now you need much more HR decisions to say, ""Hey, what do I do with pay increases? What do I do with insurance offerings? How do I cut costs but keep my people?"" That's when you need the personalized HR support that we give with over 500 HR generalists.At the same time, the technology, frankly, will make you more efficient as our clients are. Our clients are becoming much more efficient because of our mobile app that they use now, that if a client employee now needs to change their address in the system, in the old days, they'd go to their HR person or their business owner, they'd have to call us, they would talk to us they would change it. They don't do anything now. Now they say to the employee, you can change it yourself.You can go on your mobile app and do everything basically. So all those things, the technology changes, the HR focus, the total package, that makes us really more resistant and stronger in a recession-type era. -- So just to build on what Marty said, if you look at from a product standpoint, obviously, that's sticky. From a client size standpoint, you have more resilience because clients typically are larger in a PEO. So in our payroll, if you're payroll only, you tend to be smaller PEO clients or in a higher-sized bucket, which gives them a little bit more ability to withstand a downturn in the economy.Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. -- My first question is related to the e-commerce capability describing for SurePayroll. Can you just talk a little bit more broadly is there a big like digital marketing push accompanying this? So the concept being to get the small business owner over the weekend or whatever sort of Google searching and end up finding Paychex and SurePayroll and being able to onboard entirely independently. Can you just give a little bit more color around like where this is headed? Yes. -- Yes, it is. It's actually a continuation of -- what we saw was, with lead generation, we're doing a much stronger job with getting the leads in and typically, it's more of a form fill out, right? And then we get back to them, where the client contact is somehow through the lead and says, get back to me. Well, the hardest thing to do is get back to a client today, get anyone to answer the phone. So what we found with e-commerce is not only is it responsive to a client the way they want to set themselves up, when they want to do it, weekend, nights or whatever, but also that you've captured that lead because now you don't have to get back and the client will start themselves.They'll compare, they'll see the price, they'll see the product, they decide to buy, they're in the mix. And even if they get halfway into it and need help, that's fine. We have someone ready at all times to be able to just go to someone either through a chat or a direct line and talk to them to help them through the process. But you've captured them now as opposed to trying to reach back to them.And that has been one of the strongest findings through the e-commerce is, lead generation is great, but closing that lead at the time that the prospect wants to close it is huge. So that's been the biggest benefit of this thing. -- And I'd say that it's not in the future. We launched in Q2, and it's up and running. -- Yes, yes. -- OK. And then on a related note around the investments around technology that you've been talking about, when they evolve, given initiatives under way that are leveraging your underlying database of employment-related data, I mean, so you can feed back things like benchmarks or give guidance and advice? Yes? OK. -- Yes. They have already been released. So -- and given the size of our client base and employees of our clients, that can give great data. So we give data, for example, on turnover.And there obviously, it's at a gross basis kind of pulled together. But it can do it by size as well, size of clients or size of your business and so forth. So yes, we're giving data analytics. Something that's been very important to our clients, to get data analytics.And most small to midsize businesses could never get at that data or ever pay for that data in the market that we can give them very quickly using our very large client base. -- OK, great. And then just last one, Marty. Can you just summarize -- you always give really good color around the macroeconomic indicators you see in your business that give you a sense for the overall health of the economy. Can you just run through those, meaning employment growth, wage growth, the new business formation, etc.? -- Yes. I think what we've seen in the small business indexes is really focused on 50 employees and below. And what we've seen is, obviously, job growth has kind of flattened out here the last few months. Most of that is because there aren't the people out there to hire.So we're still seeing job growth, but the change in job growth is it has really flattened out to last year, down a little to flat. And we're seeing it kind of across all sectors. You are seeing wage growth probably in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, which has been good. It's coming up.And of course, those earning the least are getting the biggest increase. So they're seeing -- those earning minimum wage, etc., because of the minimum wage increases across the country are seeing 3.5% to 4% wage increase, sometimes a little bit more, where salaried or the higher-wage earners are seeing 2% or below 2% is what we're seeing, and that's kind of averaging out. Across all sectors in jobs, manufacturing kind of has been up and down but is down a bit now. Construction is still probably one of the better ones.Other services overall is the strongest, which is discretionary services. There are more part-time jobs. So again, you're seeing a little bit more growth there and a little bit more wage increases there because of the minimum wage changes. Overall, it feels steady, not necessarily heading -- it doesn't feel like it's heading into a recession.It's just job growth has kind of flattened out because it's tough to find people. What we are seeing also is -- hearing from our clients anecdotally that there is more of those on the fringe that may be high school graduates instead of college that they're bringing in and training more. So again, for our products, it's helpful because they're looking for more training, bring people on that they may not have hired before but trying to train them because it's so difficult to find people. And we actually have heard, on the negative side, probably some businesses are saying, ""Hey, I'm not taking some work because I can't find enough people to do it."" More in the trade and that kind of thing.And regionally, it's in the south that's still the strongest. Energy has picked back up, so Houston, Tex and Dallas look better. And of course, the Florida-Georgia, generally, that area is better for construction in both residential and commercial.Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. -- I just want to follow up on the workers comp part of the insurance. How big is that versus kind of health insurance in terms of the importance for your insurance business? And can you elaborate a little bit more on the issue? Is it just a down pricing market? Or is there, there are more happening there, I guess? -- So two parts, Tim, and I want to make sure that it's clear, when we say PEO and insurance and we call out softness in workers comp, we're calling out, specifically, the workers comp revenue in our insurance agency. We're not specifically referring to PEO workers comp, which is a separate conversation. That really is around the -- that's a separate discussion. So roughly half of our insurance business is workers comp premiums.And if you look at where we are this year and you look at PEO and insurance, insurance is about 30% of that number, a little bit less than that. It will go to 20% in terms of composition of that revenue. When you look at then insurance and disaggregate that part, about half workers comp, half health and benefits. Health and benefits is doing fine, upper single-digit growth and growing reasonably.And workers comp is where we've seen softness really starting a couple of quarters-or-so ago and accelerating. And the workers comp market goes through cycles. So if we have had this discussion a couple of years ago, we would have said, ""Hey, workers comp is doing great. Premiums are up, and we're getting our share."" Now we're getting our share, but the market is soft.And when it turns, who knows? But it goes through cycles, and we're going through a bit of a softening cycle now. -- OK. Fair enough. And can I follow up on the comment on the selling season? I guess, it sounded like obviously, it's good overall result, but it sounded much more about selling the broader bundle of services than necessarily client growth and, in particular, I guess, your legacy payroll businesses. Is that accurate, I guess? And can you elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of ability to grow the client base for that core kind of payroll suite of services? -- Tim, Marty can provide color commentary on the selling season. I would just caution that to infer that we weren't saying something about unit growth is not a correct assumption. -- Yes. -- And obviously, we don't give the client base per se. But I would say, generally, we came into the year expecting that the client base would grow, and we haven't been disappointed. So that's what I'd say about unit growth, and Marty can talk a little bit about the selling season. -- Yes. I think maybe what threw you off a little bit there, I mean, we had solid sales growth across the board in the first half of the year. In the third quarter, there was some moderation on the payroll side, but we still probably are -- when you look overall, we had our best par growth in three years, I'd say, and certainly year to date and in that selling season overall. I think on the small business payroll side, I think it was impacted by some things that happened there, but I think we had still good sales, particularly on the inside sales piece.And we would expect to see the HRP stronger because that's what we're pushing the most. Even on the payroll side, even small business payroll sales folks are leading with the complete package now. We just found that's what the clients were looking for. So I think it was a decent selling season, and it has continued where we've been through the year as good solid growth yearover-year in par. -- OK. And just one follow-up to that, when you said the inside sales team, is that mostly SurePayroll and then sub-10 type of employee? Or what's the end market that's served by that's a part of the sales force? -- Yes. What I mean by -- yes, I'm sorry. Our inside sales is not just SurePayroll. It's a pretty good-sized Europe sales team, which we've been increasing.And they handle, frankly, all products as well but the way they sell everything inside. And they take a lot of the leads, particularly in the small, and they take a lot of the leads that come over the web but will sell all products over the phone.Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan. -- Just a couple of quick ones. On the worksite employee front, is it fair to think that units are growing faster than the 17% given lower pass-throughs, and so it declines and some of the other pressures. It seems like, every year, WSEs are growing at a good pace. -- WSEs are growing, I would say, in the range, Tien-Tsin. If we were in the quarter, it's comparable, I would say. It's a little bit actually below but in that range. -- OK. Now, strong nonetheless then. OK. Then secondly, just on SurePayroll, do you feel like you've narrowed the gap versus some of the, call it, the Silicon Valley guys on the distribution front? Forget about the product, I know you've talked a lot about product, but just on the distribution side, do you feel like you've narrowed the gap there? -- Yes. I don't think -- yes, I mean, I think the gap was wider on how much better we were than them. So I guess, we've narrowed it all. But yes, I think we compete very effectively with the kind of the West Coast that are out there.I think pricing-wise, we've come up with some new ways to price as well and to capture that client through things like e-commerce that we've been talking about. So yes, I think we're very competitive with them. And frankly, I've seen excellent productivity and sales out of those teams. They've done very well.And the e-commerce, I think as Efrain mentioned as well, is really taking off. -- Tien-Tsin, mashing up your question with Tim's, increasingly, to understand the business, you have to go at it in a multichannel approach. You have to figure out what the right blend of feet on the street is, internal telesales and then web-based e-commerce sales. And I would say, the third piece of that trifecta was the e-commerce space sales. SurePayroll has given us that capability, and it looks like that opportunity may be additive to the other channels, not necessarily a substitute for the other channels.So we're looking at the results. We've got real-time data showing us, and increasingly in the future, to be successful selling not just payroll, but HR, too, you've got to have a capability in all three of those channels, both over the web, direct, without a sales person; field-based sales for the right kind of client; and internal telesales. And our competitors are also playing with that mix to try to figure out what makes sense. I think you need to have all three pieces of them.We have the pieces in place now. We're in the process of fine tuning each of those three pieces.Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. -- Lots of things that you're doing. I've got a ton of questions, but I'll limit it to a couple. Just with regards to just what you're doing on the e-com sales, what percentage of the SurePayroll sales are now coming through that channel? -- Well, it's pretty small. We started in the last quarter -- well, in second quarter. And so it's still pretty small. But I think it's going to be growing pretty substantially.And as Efrain said, I think he made - Efrain made a very good point there that it is, we think, in addition. So this is -- it's capturing that lead that's coming in when somebody's ready to buy right at that time and doesn't want a callback. And so I think, we're expecting that this will be in addition to kind of the other channels that we've had. -- And so I imagine you're going to end up extending it across-the-board in terms of offering this. -- That would be very likely, yes. Yes. -- OK, great. And then with regards to just micro segmenting the payroll in the HCM market. Can you describe the different dynamics? When you're taking a look at the growth that you're seeing right now, we've traditionally talked about different sub-segments, whether it's truly small sub-six employees versus 6 to 20 versus slightly higher and then getting into MMS. Where are you seeing the strongest growth? -- So I would say, in part, because of these technology advances, Mark, we're seeing strong growth in the micro segment. I think we're seeing reasonable growth in the, and I'm going to call it, the 5 to 50 segment. And then midmarket, modest, I would say, at this point but largely and due to the fact that the level of competition there is very high. We'd add one thing though.If I now say, let's talk about client segment instead of by product and payroll but by client size, now what we see is that 20 and above is increasingly fragmenting into an MMS market and a PEO market. And on the PEO side, we're doing very, very well. So if you think about PEO's comprehensive outsourcing -- you were just with NSP, I saw your note. If you look at what's happening in that market, it's pretty clear that there is a trend in the market toward comprehensive outsourcing.And what we're seeing 20 and above is exactly the same thing. So in our system, we either are going to go with that client with potentially an MMS rep or in our midmarket rep or through a PEO, and in some cases, we incentivize them to cross-pollinate. And we're seeing a lot of success on the PEO side. So I think that's a bit of an overview.I think PEO increasingly needs to be overlaid with when you talk about midmarket because it's a solution that midmarket clients are interested in. -- Yes. That probably makes sense. I've been covering the PEO since the late 90s, so it's interesting to see the acceleration and the increased interest. When we factor in Oasis, just on the operating margin, because our callback is a little bit later and so I hope you'll indulge me on this.But we're scratching it out, and it looks to us like maybe the implication would be like around 30 -- so we're seeing 37% or 38% ex Oasis, maybe 37-ish, and maybe that comes out to more like 35 to 37. Is that with Oasis? Is that in the ballpark? -- Mark, you have a very sharp pencil. Your overall, you can look at it. I won't call it out specifically. But if you do the math, you're not incredibly far off, but I would caution one thing -- -- It's Greg and I. -- I'm sorry. I would say, increasingly, we think about the business also from an EBITDA margin perspective, too. So we've given you all the pieces there to calculate. We've also called out what we expect EBITDA margin to be next year.And there's not a lot of strange adjustments. It will be very clear on the face of the cash flow statement and net income to get to a margin number, but that's what I'd say about that. And very, very preliminary. -- And from a really longer-term perspective, there's two different dynamics that are occurring. One is you're early on in terms of the implementation of some of these efficiency measures as it relates to chatbots and everything that that can end up doing from an efficiency and a service model perspective, which would obviously increase margins. On the flip side, we've got adding PEO, it's growing faster. So from a mix perspective, that's going to drive the margins down.How do we think about the balance of those two from a longer-term investor expectation perspective? -- So Mark, I guess, I would say two things on that. One is assuming the current mix, when we get through the four-year of Oasis, we would expect to come into 2021 improving EBITDA margins off the 20 base. So that would be our expectation. Caveating it, as I've been saying for 18 months, that if PEO growth accelerates even faster than we anticipate, which is still good teens growth, then that could impact that perspective.The other thing that could impact it is, I called out, management solutions. The management solutions growth in that area because it carries a higher margin, it would be an offset. But I think those are all the factors that as you plug in the model, you'd have to evaluate. -- Great. And then Marty, one last one. Just the client scores with regards to the clients that are being serviced through the chatbots. How is that trending relative to more traditional? -- Yes, very good. We look at it from a number of ways. We don't always get them to do enough client sat, but you get to that or they're getting it. We watch this very closely.I just had a meeting on this earlier this week. How many of the questions are answered in the first question that they ask. How many are going to a service provider because they're not getting the answer. And that's being refined all the time.What we're seeing is that increase from 40% are being answered by the chatbot itself, now up to 45% in just a month. And I think if we look out three months or six months from now, I think that would be -- we're hoping that that is quite a bit higher. And that's an indication to us that they're getting their answer. Now we also have other feedback channels.And so far, we're getting good feedback that the answer is being there. And again, you start with 30 questions, then it goes to 50. Now we're over 100 because of the machine learning part of that of refining the question and understanding the natural language of what's the client asking for, what are they really asking for and are we responding with the right answer. So it's pretty early, but at this early stage, to have 45% answered by the chatbot itself is very strongly, we think.So we're getting good, positive feedback on that.Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. -- I wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. First, on Oasis, you made it pretty clear that you're tracking pretty close to what you'd thought. What should we look at as the potential, most likely sources of variance, either positively or negative, things that you're tracking that we should be aware of that could cause some variance there? And then just a follow-up question quickly on the chatbot comments from the last question. It sounds like you're improving the response rate pretty nicely.What's your sense and what are your systems people telling you as kind of an ultimate ceiling for the chatbots at least within a reasonable time frame? -- Yes. I'll start with that one. I think it's around -- it's still really pretty early. You don't get a lot of great data on this.But I think if we could get 70% long term, if you could get 70% answered by the bot by itself, I think that's pretty strong based on today's standards. So having only been in it pretty early, heading toward 50%, we feel really good about it. And you do get an awful lot of data. Given our use of it, we're able to change it pretty quickly and enhance it based on the number of people that are using it.So I think it's heading toward -- I think it would be good to head toward a 60%, 70% response because there's always nuances that people may want to talk to a live person. But that is changing pretty rapidly. This is really in response to the way the client doesn't, as you'd probably know, most younger clients, in particular, don't want to talk to somebody. They'd just soon chat and if it's a chatbot that gives the answer.And by the way, this is going to expand pretty dramatically to taking you, not only answering your question but saying, ""Do you want me to take you there?"" So, ""Hey, where do I find my check stub?"" It's here, today. Now it says, it's here, go here. Next, it'll be, ""Let me take you there by hitting this."" And if the question is how do I do something, it will evolve to video, short streaming video that will show you in 30 seconds or less, this is how you do it or you can contact somebody. So that will all continue to evolve the way the client needs it.First question? -- Yes. On Oasis, I think that we have a pretty good handle now on both revenue and expenses in the business. There are targets that we have set internally in terms of cost savings that we're measuring against the business. They're comprehensive, at least the framework that we gave you.So we'll be looking at that. And obviously, a success winning client is an important part of the equation as we head into next year.Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. -- A real quick housekeeping question on the preliminary outlook for fiscal 2020. What are your interest rate assumptions on the funds held? -- I'm sorry. Say that again? -- Interest rate assumptions in 2020. -- Oh, interest rate assumptions. Matt, we didn't include them, in part, because we need to see where the Fed is at this point. But we would assume that there really are not going to be rate increases there. So you'd see some modest increase on our client -- our interest on funds held for clients at this point.That's what we think is a more likely scenario. Hopefully, we don't end up in a scenario where it goes the other way. But we tend to doubt that that's what's going to happen. -- That's right. That makes a lot of sense. I know you've been asked a bit about some of the sort of Silicon Valley start-up competitive dynamic already. And in previous calls, you've been asked more pointedly about Square, and I think just because they're a well-known name, it comes up a lot in discussions.Is that something that you're seeing more or hearing about more? Or is this still kind of a different market with respect to your kind of customer base and your targets and they're through kind of micro merchant addressable market? -- Well, I think, Matt, some of the market is the same. But we haven't seen or heard much from that. Like they announced getting into the payroll. It was more a payroll mobile app, but it was only for employers, for example, and I think it's still that way.There is not an employee e-mobile app. And that was -- and frankly, something like that. So it got a lot of press. I think that's as far as they went or at least the last that we've see.And the employee piece is really the biggest piece of the mobile app, and we feel like we have a very competitive mobile app with a five-star kind of rating at this point. So we're feeling very good that that's very competitive. And we have not seen any takeaways or any real feedback of people leaving to go to Square. I think it rounds out their product set from a credit card and processing standpoint, but we have not seen someone who's going to go there necessarily for payroll and a mobile payroll app.That's only for the employer. -- Got it. So they're probably hunting more within their own existing merchant client base as opposed to the greenfield opportunities out there more broadly where you're a lot more established. -- Yes, I think so. And that plus, I think anyone who would look at that, even though you may have your processing through them, I think if anybody was really looking for an app that provided a full feature employer and employee access and gave the full features of retirement and payroll and HR administration, all on the app, I don't think there would be any comparison, so.Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citibank. -- Thank you for all the detail, including on 2020. I wanted to kind of get into your statement on introducing the discussion on EBITDA margin, as well as saying that you're now thinking of the business more on the EBITDA basis. Is that a comment on future capital allocation, use of cash? Should we sort of maybe combining that with the comment on low PEO penetration, it implies more Oasis-type deals. How should I think of that? -- Yes. I think, to some degree, as Efrain mentioned in his comments, that does make some sense to the fact that amortizations and so forth. We want to make sure that it's very clear where the margins really are because of the PEO business and sometimes the impact on operating margins versus EBITDA margins from an acquisition type of standpoint. So I think you're certainly right on that, and Efrain, I think, mentioned that.But on a go forward basis, we're certainly looking very much on organic growth and combining the strength. Here, we bought the largest private PEO in the business, and we feel like that integration is going very well. And so will we continue part of Oasis' plans or to continue rollups of other PEOs to add more strength through their offerings, and we'll look at continuing to do that. Will it be the size of Oasis? Not really because there's no one out there of that size.But I think that their strategy of rolling up and was part of ours as well will probably continue. -- Got it. And just switching gears a bit, as your existing client employees sort of go through the current tax filing process in the tax season, are you beginning to maybe see a change in withholding? Is there potentially maybe a surprise with their returns and so on? Or is it too early to tell? Any comment on future withholding patterns? -- I think we haven't really seen it yet. I think it might be a little bit too early until the filing date of April, even though people file early. I think they are -- you do get anecdotal evidence that certainly people are looking at it and asking a lot of questions of their tax preparers, like how do I avoid this next time? And how do -- and so probably, we would expect to see withholdings go up a little bit and, therefore, probably the cash balance is up a little bit. But it's a little bit early to see that just yet. -- Got it. And last question is, it's been asked a couple of different ways, the digital option that you spoke about. And you mentioned that you might be seeing a demand for this in other parts of your tech stack. Can you talk about how you're thinking of the level of future tech investments, as well as whether this mix will rethink your sort of your traditional sales force process? -- Well, I think, you're talking more of the e-commerce. But I mean, overall, we're always looking, as Efrain said, like even the sales -- well, the sales process is definitely -- it has been changing. And I feel like we've been changing and, to some degree, a few years ago, catching up now. I feel like we're in pretty good shape with the lead and demand gen investment that we use from some of the tax reform money in the last year to 18 months.We really have found how to capture much more data on client even searching for Paychex, how to get more of those leads. And also how to deal with leads that need to be nurtured, as we would say. So they're not ready to buy yet, but you don't just lose those. You put them in a process, where they're nurtured, and I'm sure you're aware of this, white papers on HR, and you build the credibility of paychecks.So when they are ready to buy, they're right there. So the increase and the way we've handled this from a digital process and a much more defined data analytics is much stronger than ever. We've been very good on the data analytics for using our client data that say when someone might have an issue or might be ready to leave us or something like that, but this lead generation has gotten a lot tighter. And then the next-generation -- the further generation of that is this e-commerce platform, it's sure right now, which we also found that the leads may be great, we may be able to get ahold of a lot more prospects, but it's hard -- but we may get a lot more prospects, but it's really hard to reach them.And so e-commerce allows them to come in, decide and select and start going down the process. And that is a much more powerful tool, probably than we even expected as far as capturing new leads. So we're constantly looking at this. The data collection and data analytics is becoming such a bigger part of the service model and the sales model.And I feel like we've got the right people on it and the right tools in place. -- And the other part of that question on the absolute level of tax spend? -- I think, well, we're at a pretty good kind of percentage of revenue, and we kind of stick to that. I think we had, obviously, an enhancement to that last year, but we feel like we can get back to a pretty levelized level of tax spend, and we're doing pretty good with that. We've also found ways to be more productive in the tech side as well and what our spend is by how we're doing some of that.Your final question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. -- Listen, I know we're closing in on 90 minutes here, so just three real quick ones. First, if you look at organic PEO growth in fiscal '19, can you help disaggregate the kind of WSE growth versus insurance and any other pricing dynamics that may be impacting growth? -- When you say impacting growth, what do you mean, David? I'm not sure -- -- Well, I'm just trying to disaggregate, I think, this over 17% of organic growth? -- Yes. So we've seen teens growth in revenue. I called out on the script where we are in terms of PEO and insurance growth. When you look at the PEO, again, growing in the teens.Worksite employees, growing in the teens. Some quarters, we've been a little bit above. Some quarters, a little bit below. But you're getting the contributions coming from the fact that you're getting good worksite employee growth, not necessarily because of pricing or add-ons from pass-through, so I'd say that.When you disaggregate a little bit of the change in the growth rate that I called out, it really is a function of the fact that the insurance portion of PEO and insurance is growing more slowly than the PEO. And then we've got this drag that really is more of a second half of the year -- second half of the year event that will be persistent to -into next year, and it could change, markets change. But if you look at the underlying PEO, we expect it to grow in the teens, and we would expect worksite employee growth to grow comparable, that's excluding Oasis. Including Oasis, the growth rate comes down a little bit just simply because it's a larger business.The low of large number starts to take place. And we expect to get a combination of both worksite employee growth and new client growth to drive the growth that's embedded in the outlook that we gave. -- All right. Great. And just following up in terms of the composition of the PEO, I mean, obviously, two significant acquisitions in the last year and a half or two years. Can you give us just a sense of what the PEO looks like today, excluding the ASO? For example, I know you report a combined WSE number.Can you give us a sense for what PEO is, excluding ASO? And what your mix is between white and blue gray? And also, what your at-risk kind of percentage of insurance businesses? -- Yes. OK, good. Three compound -- that's a one -- that counts for three, David, but OK, I'll answer it. So the first thing is, look, our client base is blue gray or gray blue, less white and more gray blue.And obviously, we want the composition of that base to moderate more gray over time than simply blue. So we'll look at that. That has a lot of implications as you know because you know the industry very well in terms of rates of healthcare attachment and workers comp rates. But we feel we're in a good place there.If you look at where we are from a worksite employee perspective, I haven't disclosed it. But if you look at No. 1 and you know what that number is, and you know what No. 3 is, we're No.2, right in the middle of the two. So that will give you a sense of where we are from a worksite employee standpoint. And so we think in that space that Oasis has -- and I would come back to something Marty said earlier, in that space that the combination of the Paychex's PEO and also, HROI and Oasis occupy, there is a lot of opportunity there. And right now, our at-risk insurance and those nonguaranteed cost insurance is primarily limited to the Florida market, and everything else that -- so the only thing that we are reporting as pass-through revenue is the minimum premium revenues largely, the minimum premium revenues that we're collecting in Florida, which is a percentage.It's not half of the percent of what we sell on health insurance. It's a pretty carefully controlled amount of risk that we're taking. So if you look at everyone else in the industry, we occupy a middle ground between the position that the largest competitor takes, which is all apparently guaranteed cost and others that are all at-risk. We carefully control the amount of that risk insurance that we have. -- OK, got it. And then just finally in the spirit of abusing the time limit here, your workers comp comment, because of the blue gray composition, why isn't it that the workers comp dynamic in the insurance side of your business isn't impacting the PEO business as well? I would think more favorably, it being [Inaudible]. So what's going on? -- In the PEO, because you've got a bundle, you can offset the pieces of the bundle that you're selling. So in a steady state, right? You would have some impact, but the reality is, you're balancing that between the amount of healthcare insurance you're selling and the amount of workers comp that's attaching and also the amount of admin fees you're charging. Our PEO is a little bit different probably than anyone else in the industry. When we underwrite a PEO customer, we make a determination, do we want you in our risk pool? Because if we don't want you in our risk pool, we're going to send you to our insurance agency, and you're going to get priced that way.So we've got a little bit more control on the PEO side. And to the extent that we don't like the risk, we basically offset the -- we offload the risk to specialized carriers that don't mind dealing with that level of risk. So the net-net net of what I just said is, it really doesn't have much of an impact on the PEO side.Thank you. I will now return the call to Martin Mucci for any additional or closing remarks. -- Great. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days.Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third-quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex.

he technology services industry is continuously adopting and implementing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and biometrics, advanced data analytics and machine learning. This trend should keep increasing demand for the services.Given the significant savings post the tax reform, most of the technology companies are gearing up to invest the same for enhancing shareholders' value or to fund mergers and acquisitions to expand into new markets and technologies. Industry participants are also gearing up to assess global operations, which include supply chain, treasury, distribution, sales and marketing and finance, to function more effectively.The industry includes consumer as well as business-oriented products and services. It comprises companies with diversified end markets and customer base.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Zacks  stocks - IQVIA Holdings Inc.  and Delphi Technologies PLC  . Both the stocks are part of the broader Zacks  sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).

The stock has gained 1.3% in the past three months, underperforming the 15.1% rise of the  it belongs to.Let's see how things are shaping up for the announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $20 million, indicating growth of 5.3% from the year-ago quarter's figure. The expected upside is likely to be driven by strength in security-related managed services, security-related consulting and professional services and equipment, hardware and software resales. In the third quarter of 2018, revenues increased 6% year over year to $19.2 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $16 cents, which reflects year-over-year decline of 20%.

 is benefiting from vast global network and innovative product portfolio.Recently, the company reported mixed fourth-quarter 2018 results wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.06 beat the consensus mark by 18 cents and declined on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $1.17 billion missed the consensus estimate by $3.7 million and decreased 9.2% year over year on a reported basis and 5% on an adjusted basis (adjustments were made for currency exchange and certain aftermarket original equipment service revenue retained by the former parent).Delphi Technologies has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. It delivered average four-quarter beat of 8.6%.Delphi Technologies has a geographically diverse revenue base. Region-wise, it derived 44% of revenues from Europe, 28% from North America, 25% from the Asia Pacific and 3% from South America in 2018.Adjusted revenues increased 16% in South America, 6% in North America and 3% in Europe. While growth in Commercial Vehicle and GDi drive revenues from Europe, the same from North America is benefiting from program launches and increased sales to Commercial Vehicle customers.Regional presence coupled with its diversified and innovative product portfolio with updated technologies makes Delphi Technologies a solid choice for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This is because OEMs are focused on increasing efficiency and expanding their global manufacturing footprint by choosing suppliers with global scale, who can easily adapt to regional variations. In 2018, within the Powertrain Systems segment, 72% of net sales came from light vehicle OEM customers and 28% from commercial vehicle OEM customers.Furthermore, the company's aftermarket business continues to generate stable recurring revenues. Also, Delphi Technologies witnessed robust growth across its two portfolios - Power Electronics and Commercial Vehicle Systems - which grew approximately 30% and 25%, respectively, in fourth-quarter 2018.Delphi Technologies has a highly leveraged balance sheet. As of Dec 31, 2018, long-term debt was $1.49 billion, while cash and cash equivalents were $359 million. Such a cash position implies that the company needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Declining revenues in passenger car diesel and GDi continue to weigh on Delphi Technologies' top line. Global presence exposes it to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The company's business also gets affected by seasonal factors.Currently, Delphi Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

aychex (PAYX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when i  s results for the quarter ended February 2019. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 27, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to pos  of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +41.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.03 billion, up 19.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Paychex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paychex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would pos  of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.65, delivering a surprise of +3.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paychex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

emand for building maintenance services is currently in good shape despite a slowdown in the residential construction market, driven by rise in disposable and per capita income, lower unemployment rate and improving consumer confidence. In terms of non-residential, strength in the economy has been driving demand for offices and commercial buildings, a trend that will likely continue in the near to mid-term.Ebbing trade war and interest rate fears should be a tailwind for the industry.

Both the stocks are part of the broader  (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Rollins has a market capitalization of $13.3 billion, ABM Industries' market cap is $2.3 billion.As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight.

For the next year, Rollin's earnings are expected to grow 9.1% while that of ABM Industries are projected to increase 17.4%. Thus, Rollins has an edge over ABM Industries in terms of current year projected earnings growth. ABM Industries clinches the round in terms of next year earnings growth projections.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.ABM Industries has an impressive earning surprise history. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters with an average positive beat of 6.6%.

 prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.One such stock is  , which has gained 15.4% in the past year, outperforming the 12.3% rally of the  it belongs to.It has an expected long-term (three to five years) earnings per share growth rate of 10.4%. Moreover, the bottom line is expected to register 11.5% and 10.5% growth in 2019 and 2020, respectively.However, the company faces its share of headwinds. Seasonality is likely to lower predictably in Waste Connections' revenue generation and increase operating risks. Stringent environmental, health and safety laws have been hindering the company's operations and raising its operating costs. High debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile. Despite these headwinds, we believe that the company has enough positives that justify retention in investors' portfolio.Waste Connections is bolstering its stake in the solid waste industry through strategic acquisitions. In 2018, the company completed the purchase of 20 individually immaterial non-hazardous solid waste collection, recycling, transfer and disposal businesses. Previously, the company completed 14 acquisitions in 2017, 12 in 2016 and 14 in 2015. Some of the notable buyouts include that of American Disposal Services and certain affiliates, Groot Industries and Progressive Waste.We also appreciate the company's focus on secondary and rural markets to garner a higher local market share, which will be difficult to attain in more competitive urban markets. This, in turn, decreases Waste Connections' exposure to customer churn and improves financial returns.Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock enjoys optimal asset positioning as its disposal sites are located at prime locations, helping it generate higher profitability. Considering the importance of costs associated with the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites, having disposal capacity close to the waste stream offers a competitive advantage.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Omnicom  , Paychex  and Automatic Data Processing  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.One such stock is  , which has gained 14.6% in the past year, outperforming the 11.6% gain of the  it belongs to and 1.7% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.It has an expected long-term (three to five years) earnings per share growth rate of 8.8%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 5.2% growth in 2019 and 10.5% in 2020.However, the company faces its share of headwinds. Republic Services continues to face weak landfill pricing due to high cost of landfills and leachate. High debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile. Price increase and profitability expansion becomes difficult while operating in a highly competitive solid waste industry. Despite these headwinds, we believe that the company has enough positives that justify retention in investors' portfolio.Republic Services continues to grow internally with the help of long-term contracts for the collection, recycling and disposal of solid waste materials. Such agreements increase the company's contracted revenue base, thereby strengthening its market position.The company continues to look out for strategic price increase in order to offset increased costs, improve operating margins and enjoy an appropriate return on its substantial investments in vehicles, equipment, landfills, transfer stations and recycling centers. The company's business stands to benefit from increasing demand for recycling of waste products. Notably, 2018 revenues were driven by 2.5% internal growth.Republic Services is focused on increasing its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles and converting rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders, which will streamline the cost structure, improve revenue quality and enhance growth through profitable investment opportunities. In 2018, almost 20% of the company's fleet operated on natural gas and nearly 75% of its residential routes were converted to automated single-driver trucks.Meanwhile, the company is highly optimistic about the usage of CNG vehicles, which will help it maintain a clean environment. In 2018, almost 13% of the replacement vehicle purchases were CNG vehicles. As of Dec 31, 2018, Republic Services operated 37 CNG fueling stations.Currently, Republic Services is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

he staffing industry is growing steadily on promising developments in the broader economy. Trump administration's business-friendly approach, including tax cuts and higher government spending, has been a major catalyst. Thriving manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities on the back of favorable policies are leading to additional hiring and wage increase.Staffing firms are shifting toward employee-friendly, technology-based recruiting techniques like social media, mobile technology, artificial intelligence and big data. Also, technologies like cloud and blockchain offer more storage and safety to HR data. These trends are propelling demand for staffing services.The  is a group within the broader  . The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid growth prospects in the near term. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #49, which places it in the top 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Given this backdrop, let's do a comparative analysis of two staffing stocks -  and  . Korn/Ferry has a market capitalization of $2.7 billion and Kforce's market cap is $920.7 million.As the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using other parameters to provide investors a better insight.You can see Shares of Kforce have gained 27.2% in the past year against Korn/Ferry's decline of 5.5% and the industry's fall of 3.2%. So, Kforce clearly scores over Korn/Ferry.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.Korn/Ferry's current quarter earnings are projected to grow 11.3% year over year while that of Kforce are expected to increase 5.4%. Looking at the full year picture, Korn/Ferry's earnings are projected to grow 22.8% while that of Kforce are expected to increase 9.6%. Thus, Korn/Ferryhas an edge over Kforce in terms of quarterly and yearly earnings growth expectations.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.Kforce and Korn/Ferry have an impressive trailing four quarter earnings surprise history. Korn/Ferry delivered higher average positive surprise of 7.2% compared with Kforce's 3.8%.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Korn/Ferry's TTM net margin of 9.4% is above Kforce's figure of 4.1% and the industry's tally of 3.8%.EV/EBITDA is a commonly used multiple for the staffing industry. We observe that while Korn/Ferry and Kforce have trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratios of 8.77 and 11.14, respectively, the industry's figure is at 8.27X. Although the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Korn/Ferry has a lower EV/EBITDA value than Kforce.So, Korn/Ferry looks cheap compared with Kforce.Our comparative analysis shows that Korn/Ferry scores over Kforce in terms of quarterly and yearly expected earnings growth, earnings surprise and net margin. Also, Korn/Ferry is trading cheap compared with Kforce. A fast share price rally in the past year led to a rich valuation for Kforce.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Omnicom  and Paychex  , each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).Long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Omnicom and Paychex is 4.7% and 8.8%, respectively.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?Who wouldn't?

"n recent trading, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $72.07, changing hands for $72.47/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Paychex Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $63.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $80.00. The standard deviation is $4.651.But the whole reason to look at the  PAYX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PAYX crossing above that average target price of $72.07/share, investors in PAYX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $72.07 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Paychex Inc:

 is benefiting from strong organic growth and lower tax rates that continue to suppor  growth. The company's capital markets and investment management businesses are likely to stay in good shape as long as uncertainty-induced market volatility is prevalent.In a year's time, shares of the company have gained 4.8%, significantly outperforming the 1.8% rally of the  it belongs to.With an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a market cap of $11.7 billion, Broadridge's seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio for now.The company's recurring fee revenues that constitutes significant chunk of the top line have been growing significantly in the past few years. Broadridge currently has a large and growing recurring revenue backlog, which provides good visibility on organic revenues in the near to mid-term. | The company's capital market business should grow as markets globalize consistently and regulatory changes continue to take place. Its investment management business is benefiting from increase in scrutiny on money movements. Also, growing demand for transparency in corporate governance should drive the governance business.Increasing adoption of outsourcing in EMEA and APAC should boost Broadridge's global technology and operations segment. A strong economy should keep demand for the company's customer communications products in good shape.With increasing demand for technology solutions, Broadridge has ramped up investments in digital, AI, cloud and blockchain particularly via acquisitions. These investments should be beneficial in the long run.Despite riding on significant growth prospects, Broadridge is not free from overhangs. Increased spending will, to some extent, offset the positive impact of higher revenues and weigh on bottom line in the near term.

"On today's episode of the Tech Talk Tuesday podcast, Ryan McQueeney is joined by Chad Parks, founder and CEO of Ubiquity Retirement + Savings, to discuss the intersection of technology, retirement planning, and small business.Remember to subscribe and leave a rating on  if you enjoy the show!Ubiquity Retirement + Savings is a rapidly-growing fintech company that offers customizable, flat-fee retirement plans for small businesses. Chad started the business two decades ago after realizing that small businesses were drastically underserved in the retirement planning market. The company strives to use technology to improve its offerings and outcomes, most recently launching a cloud-based SaaS record-keeping platform called Paradigm.Beyond Ubiquity, Chad is an expert on the retirement industry and has encouraged federal lawmakers to pass small-business-friendly legislation. He has even produced a documentary film  , to help educate Americans on lingering problems in the retirement landscape.This combination of experiences makes Chad the perfect person to talk to about technology, retirement planning, and small business. In today's Tech Talk, Ryan and Chad chat about the intersection of these ideas, focusing on the needs that still need to be met, the progress that has been made in recent years, and where small businesses should go from here.Chad said that small businesses are slowly adopting ""one-stop shop"" platforms for saving, planning, record management, and accounting. These types of suites have been available to larger businesses in the past, but small business owners are just now starting to see software designed for them.But there is still plenty of work to be done, Chad thinks. Companies like Square  , Paychex  , and Intuit  are fantastic at what they do-yet these services still hold a relatively small share of their respective markets, as many owners still opt for a pen-and-pencil management.There are also national considerations that affect small business owners just as they do our wider society. Huge generations are entering retirement age and life expectancy is high, stretching the resources of federal retirement programs to the brink. Chad argues that people need to shift their perspective on saving for retirement to account for this situation.Luckily, there are plenty of new tools and resources that make this shift easier, and Ryan and Chad discuss several of them on today's episode.

Shares have added about 5.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Paychex due for a pullback?

The company also witnessed solid demand for its professional employer organization (""PEO"") services.In the quarter, Paychex announced a deal to purchase Florida-based Oasis Outsourcing for $1.2 billion in cash. The acquisition is expected to bolster the company's PEO growth strategy, expand its PEO sales organization and boost its client base.

The combined entity is anticipated to deliver solid human resources and payroll solutions to clients and employees.Revenues from Management Solutions improved 5% year over year to $685.4 million. The growth was driven by increases in the company's client bases across many of its services.

However, operating income margin declined 190 basis points to 35.8%.Paychex's total expenses rose 10% from the year-ago quarter to $551.7 million on account of continued growth in PEO business, higher compensation-related costs and acquisition of Lessor.Paychex exited the fiscal second-quarter 2019 with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $759 million compared with $523 million at the end of the prior quarter.

Hundsun stated in a press release that issue size of all kind of bonds in China surpassed $6.4 trillion (RMB 43 trillion) in 2018 and foreign inflows to the bond market reached about $100 billion (RMB 673.7 billion).The move is likely to benefit IHS Markit's Financial Services segment that performed well in the las  ed quarter.

" is currently benefitting from strategic buyouts and collaborations that are boosting the top line.With expected long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 12.8% and a market cap of $16.2 billion, it is a stock that investors should retain in their portfolios.Aptiv is well poised to gain from secular trends related to connected cars. With safety becoming a key selling point for these cars, automakers are seeking related technologies. This is one of the reasons for the rapid improvement of the driver-assistance system market. Demand for personalization, infotainment connectivity and convenience are also increasing rapidly. Further, added features require more wiring inside vehicles. We believe that with excellent system integration expertise, the company is likely to leverage on growing electrification, connectivity and autonomy trends in the automotive sector.Falling environmental impact and increasing fuel economy are key trends in the industry. Also, OEMs have increased their search for better engine management and lower power consumption. Aptiv intends to take advantage of this trend as its ""smart architecture"" reduces wiring requirement in cars, which makes them more fuel efficient and provide new features.Higher investments in advanced technology and collaborations have enabled the company to explore opportunities in the rapidly growing automotive sector. On the technology front, the company has launched automated driving software, key active safety sensing technologies and Multi-Domain Controller.Aptiv is also active on the partnership front. It has collaborated with Mobileye N.V. for joint development of Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning (""CSLP"") system. Its collaboration with BMW and Intel for development and use of self-driving technology is also encouraging.Acquisitions are key catalysts for Aptiv. So far in 2018, the company acquired KUM and Winchester Interconnect. The buyouts are expected to strengthen the Signal and Power Solutions segment. Aptiv's acquisition strategy offers diverse product portfolio and establishes strong foothold in industrial end markets, which will boost the company's top line. | In spite of significant growth prospects, Aptiv is not free from headwinds. The company is likely to witness escalation in costs as it plans to continue making investments in organic as well as inorganic growth, while being embroiled in a legal matter. Nevertheless, we believe that continued investments in technology and acquisitions bode well for the company's top- and bottom-line growth.Currently, Aptiv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Chicago, IL - December 27, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon  , Johnson & Johnson  , Home Depot  , Medtronic  and Paychex  .The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon, Johnson & Johnson and Home Depot. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Buy-ranked  's shares have outperformed the broader market year to date by a wide margin (the stock is up +14.9% vs. the -12% decline for the S&P 500 as a whole). The Zacks analyst thinks Amazon's strengthening retail position, with the help of its growing global footprint and distribution strength, remains its key growth driver.Moreover, robust Prime program and its benefits will continue to aid Amazon's retail business. Also, the rapid expansion of grocery services via Prime is a major positive. Additionally, the company's growing brick and mortar presence is a tailwind. Further, increasing AWS regions and its growing adoption will continue to aid Amazon's cloud momentum. Also, a rising number of Alexa compatible devices is a major positive.The company's growing initiatives are likely to aid its performance in the current holiday season. However, the management has lowered its sales outlook for this season due to changes in Indian holiday timing. Also, rising cloud battle and heavy investment in fulfillment centers are headwinds.Shares of  have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals in the past six months, gaining +1% vs. +5.3%. J&J's Pharma segment is performing better than the market in 2018 despite the impact of biosimilars on Remicade sales. Also, the Medical Devices and Consumer units are seeing improving organic growth trends.Though quite a few key products in J&J's portfolio are facing generic competition, the Zacks analyst thinks new products in all segments, successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top-line growth. J&J enjoys a robust multi-year pipeline of new drugs and line extensions.Headwinds like generics, pricing pressure and soft  conditions remain. Allegations that its talc/baby powders contain asbestos which causes the users to develop ovarian cancer have been an overhang on the stock's price lately.Buy-ranked  's shares have lost 18.9% in the past six months, marginally underperforming the Zacks Retail Building Products industry's 17% decline. The company has a five-year long trend of beating earnings estimates, which continued in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, it has delivered positive sales surprise in eight out of the last nine quarters.Results gained from strength in both professional and do-it-yourself categories. It also benefits from positive customer response for assortments as well as enhancements to drive integrated shopping experience. The company is witnessing strength across store operations as well as digital portals, which reflect strong customer demand in the home improvement markets.Backed by solid year-to-date performance, the company raised its earnings and sales forecast for fiscal 2018. However, the company saw tough comps comparisons in the fiscal third quarter owing to impacts of hurricane-related sales gains in the prior year. Higher supply chain and transportation costs also continue to hurt margins.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Medtronic and Paychex.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

he outsourcing industry is currently benefitting from higher demand for expertise to improve efficiency and reduce costs.Post the 2017 tax reform, the U.S. outsourcing companies are increasingly allocating tax savings toward investments in digital and artificial intelligence as well as cloud and blockchain. This is enhancing their service quality and spurring demand.Considering this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stock -  and  . While ADP has a market capitalization of $55.9 billion, the same for Paychex is $23.1 billion.As the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), we are using other parameters to provide investors a better insight.You can see ADP has performed impressively on the bourse year to date compared with Paychex and the  . While ADP's shares have gained 10.7%, the same for Paychex declined 4.2%. The industry inched down 2.9% in the same time frame.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.ADP's current year earnings are projected to grow 21.2% compared with 12.2% for Paychex. For the next year, ADP's expected earnings growth rate is 12.7% compared with Paychex's 6.8%. Thus, ADP has an edge in terms of current year as well as next year expected earnings growth.The long-term (three to five years) expected earnings per share growth rate for ADP is 12.5% and the same for Paychex is 8.8%.The direction of estimate revisions is an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on current-year and next-year earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days, ADP is better placed.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings increased 1.7% for ADP and 0.4% for Paychex. For fiscal 2020, the consensus estimate inched up 0.7% for ADP but declined 0.6% for Paychex.The earnings surprise history of a stock provides investors an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.ADP and Paychex have an impressive trailing four quarter earnings surprise history. However, ADP delivered average positive earnings surprise of 7% compared with Paychex's 2%.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 26.4%, Paychex has a lead over ADP's and the industry's TTM net margins of 12.2% and 15.1%, respectively.Comparing the companies with each other and the industry on the basis of price to forward 12 months' earnings, we see that ADP's 23.18X is ahead of Paychex's 21.93X and the industry's 18.16X.So, ADP looks expensive compared with Paychex and the industry.Our comparative analysis shows that ADP scores over Paychex in terms of price performance, expected earnings growth, estimate revisions and earnings surprise history. However, a faster share price rally led to higher valuation of the company. Paychex is superior in terms of TTM net margin.A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Interpublic  and Navigant Consulting  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 is currently benefitting from a business model that supports recurring revenue generation.Shares of the company have inched up 1.4% on a year-to-date basis, against the  's decline of 7.1%.With expected long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 10% and a market cap of $10.7 billion, it is a stock that investors should retain in their portfolios now.Let's take a look at the factors that bode well for the company.Broadridge aims to achieve internal growth on the back of strategic acquisitions. So far in 2018, the company acquired MackayWilliams LLP, FundAssist Limited and ActivePath. These acquisitions have enabled the company to emerge as one of the leading financial and outsourcing services providers.Some notable buyouts of 2017 include Summit Financial Disclosure, LLC and Message Automation Limited. In 2016, the company acquired 4sight Financial Software Limited and Inveshare Inc as well as completed the buyout of DST Systems Inc.'s North American Customer Communications (NACC) business. These acquisitions are aiding the company to expand product portfolio and widen customer reach.Broadridge is capable of generating significant recurring revenues, courtesy of a strong business model. Recurring revenues account for a major portion of the company's business and includes contributions from net new business, internal growth and acquisition-related synergies. Strong revenues will continue to expand margins and boost the company's bottom-line growth.Broadridge returns excess cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and share buybacks. In fiscal 2018, Broadridge returned $391 million to shareholders through a combination of dividend payment and share repurchases. On August 2018, the company's board of directors approved a dividend hike of 33%, marking the eleventh consecutive year of annual dividend increase since the company became public in 2007.In fiscal 2017, Broadridge repurchased $342.8 million worth of its treasury stock and paid dividend worth 152.2 million. These shareholder-friendly initiatives boost investors' optimism but and make a positive impact on earnings. | In spite of significant growth prospects, Broadridge is not free from headwinds. Frequent acquisitions add to costs and integration risks as well as are expected to have negative impact on organic growth going forward. Nevertheless, we believe that diversife portfolio along with strategic acquisitions bode well for the company in the long term.Currently, Broadridge carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector are Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , Paychex, Inc.  and Navigant Consulting, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Automatic Data Processing, Paychex and Navigant Consulting is 12.5%, 8.8%, and 13.5%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon (AMZN), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Home Depot (HD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Buy-ranked  's shares have outperformed the broader market year to date by a wide margin (the stock is up +14.9% vs. the -12% decline for the S&P 500 as a whole). The Zacks analyst thinks Amazon's strengthening retail position, with the help of its growing global footprint and distribution strength, remains its key growth driver.Moreover, robust Prime program and its benefits will continue to aid Amazon's retail business. Also, the rapid expansion of grocery services via Prime is a major positive. Additionally, the company's growing brick and mortar presence is a tailwind. Further, increasing AWS regions and its growing adoption will continue to aid Amazon's cloud momentum. Also, a rising number of Alexa compatible devices is a major positive.The company's growing initiatives are likely to aid its performance in the current holiday season. However, the management has lowered its sales outlook for this season due to changes in Indian holiday timing. Also, rising cloud battle and heavy investment in fulfillment centers are headwinds.(You can  ).Shares of  have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals in the past six months, gaining +1% vs. +5.3%. J&J's Pharma segment is performing better than the market in 2018 despite the impact of biosimilars on Remicade sales. Also, the Medical Devices and Consumer units are seeing improving organic growth trends.Though quite a few key products in J&J's portfolio are facing generic competition, the Zacks analyst thinks new products in all segments, successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top-line growth. J&J enjoys a robust multi-year pipeline of new drugs and line extensions.Headwinds like generics, pricing pressure and soft  conditions remain. Allegations that its talc/baby powders contain asbestos which causes the users to develop ovarian cancer have been an overhang on the stock's price lately.(You can  ).Buy-ranked  's shares have lost 18.9% in the past six months, marginally underperforming the Zacks Retail Building Products industry's 17% decline. The company has a five-year long trend of beating earnings estimates, which continued in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, it has delivered positive sales surprise in eight out of the last nine quarters.Results gained from strength in both professional and do-it-yourself categories. It also benefits from positive customer response for assortments as well as enhancements to drive integrated shopping experience. The company is witnessing strength across store operations as well as digital portals, which reflect strong customer demand in the home improvement markets.Backed by solid year-to-date performance, the company raised its earnings and sales forecast for fiscal 2018. However, the company saw tough comps comparisons in the fiscal third quarter owing to impacts of hurricane-related sales gains in the prior year. Higher supply chain and transportation costs also continue to hurt margins.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Medtronic (MDT),  (AMTD) and Paychex (PAYX).It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

all Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday after witnessing a highly volatile session following the Fed's decision to hike rates for the fourth time this year. Investors opted for panic selling despite the fact that the central bank hinted at a more dovish stance in 2019 as well as positive developments on the U.S.-China trade war front. All three major stock indexes suffered significantly.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 23,323.66, declining 1.5% or 351.98 points.

This was the fourth rate hike by the central bank in 2018. However, the Fed hinted that it may lower the pace of rate hikes from the previous projections of three to two times for 2019.The Central opted for fourth rate hike despite the fact that President Donald Trump severely criticized the Fed for adopting an aggressive monetary stance which according to him is acting as a hindrance to realize full potential of his government's fiscal stimulus.The reason for Fed's dovish stance is a reflection of the U.S. economy. The central bank estimates that the U.S. economy will grow 3% and 2.3% in 2018 and 2019 respectively, lower than earlier forecast of 3.1% and 2.5% in September.Unemployment rate has been kept unchanged at 3.7% and 3.5% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

 is currently benefiting from lower tax rates that are contributing to the bottom line. Shares of the company have rallied 37.1% over the past year, against the 9.5% decline of the  it belongs to.Increased regulatory scrutiny and a proliferation of corporate litigation are likely to increase the demand for FTI Consulting's products. Additionally, structural change has become a necessity in the rapidly evolving global markets as management teams look to fend off rivals, protect intellectual property rights and transform businesses via M&A, divestiture and other restructuring activities. These developments call for FTI Consulting's specialized skill sets and are likely to boost revenues.Lower tax rates (as a result of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are contributing to FTI Consulting's bottom line. The company witnessed lower effective tax rate of 31% in third-quarter 2018 compared with 22.2% in the year-ago quarter. In the quarter, earnings came in at $1.00 per share, up from 83 cents in the year-ago quarter.With the bottom line in good shape, the company continues to pursue opportunities in areas like business transformation services, transaction advisory business, restructuring, retail, construction, data and analytics, cyber business, information governance and international arbitration. This makes it an excellent partner for global clients dealing with international arbitration issues, thereby generating continued revenue growth from the existing international operations.FTI Consulting raised 2018 earnings per share (EPS) guidance to the range of $3.60-$3.80 from the previous expectation of $2.90-$3.30.Despite significant growth prospects, FTI Consulting is not free from overhangs. Higher investments in hiring professionals are likely to increase costs and put pressure on bottom-line growth. Also, the company remains susceptible to seasonality and foreign exchange risks. Nevertheless, we believe that strong international operations bode well for FTI Consulting.Currently, FTI Consulting carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks  sector are Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , Paychex, Inc.  and Navigant Consulting, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Automatic Data Processing, Paychex and Navigant Consulting is 12.5%, 8.8% and 13.5%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.8%.Revenues are expected to be $856.73 million, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Paychex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paychex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of +3.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paychex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

he waste management market is likely to gain traction backed by rise in population, increase in environmental awareness, and rapid industrialization and urbanization. Strict government restrictions to limit landfills and steps to increase the collection of waste for recycling are also expected to create opportunities for the industry.Per a new report by Allied Market Research, the global waste management market size is projected to witness CAGR of 6.2% from 2017 to 2023 to reach $435.0 billion.Notably, The Zacks  Industry has a  in the top 14% (36 out of the 250 plus groups). This indicates a relatively favorable earnings outlook for the industry.Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two waste removal services stocks - Waste Management  and Republic Services  . Both the stocks are part of the broader  (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Waste Management has a market capitalization of $40 billion, Republic Services' market cap is $25.1 billion.As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight. You can see Republic Services clearly scores over Waste Management in terms of price performance. Shares of Republic Services have gained 19% in a year's time, outperforming the 12% rise of Waste Management and 10% rise of the industry.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.Waste Management's earnings for 2018 are projected to grow 28.6% while that of Republic Services are expected to increase 25.9%. For 2019, Waste Management's earnings are expected to register 7.1% growth compared with 5.9% for Republic Services.Thus, Waste Management has an edge over Republic Services in terms of yearly projected earnings growth.The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Waste Management's 2018 earnings inched up 1.5% in the past 60 days. For Republic Services, estimates for 2018 moved up 0.7% in the same time frame.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.Waste Management and Republic Services have an impressive earning surprise history, with their earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters.However, Waste Management has delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise than Republic Services. The reading for Waste Management is 4.5% compared with 3.9% for Republic Services.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Waste Management's TTM net margin of 11.6% places it favorably in comparison to the industry's figure of 11% and Republic Services' figure of 9.5%.EV/EBITDA is a commonly used multiple for the waste management industry. We observe that while Republic Services and Waste Connections have EV/EBITDA ratios of 13.9 and 13.6, respectively, the industry's figure stands at 12.4. Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Waste Management has a lower EV/EBITDA value than Republic Services.So, Waste Management looks cheaper than republic Services.Our comparative analysis shows that while Republic Services scores over Waste Management in terms of year over year price performance and earnings estimate revisions, Waste management has an edge in terms of yearly projected earnings growth, surprise history and net margin.Although faster share price rally in the past year led to a rich valuation for both stocks compared with the industry, Waste Management is trading slightly cheaper compared to Republic Services.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Total System Services, Inc.  and Paychex, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Total System Services and Paychex is 14.2%, and 8.5%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

ll investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Headquartered in Rochester, Paychex (PAYX) is a Business Services stock that has seen a price change of 0.09% so far this year. The payroll processor and human-resources services provider is paying out a dividend of $0.56 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.29% compared to the Outsourcing industry's yield of 0.48% and the S&P 500's yield of 2.02%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.24 is up 8.7% from last year. Paychex has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 10.32%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Paychex's payout ratio is 90%, which means it paid out 90% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.PAYX is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.85 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.76%.Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, PAYX is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The decline was primarily due to weakness across listing and e-commerce services.Fang's top line has been weak in recent times particularly because of a decline in its e-commerce services revenues, which have been affected by the company's reversion to a technology-driven platform model. | This probably impacted share price that has declined 57.8% over the past year against the 3.4% decline of the  it belongs to.

he staffing industry is currently benefiting from a strong economy, leading to robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities, and higher corporate spending post the tax reform. The labor market has been witnessing record low unemployment levels and strong job additions since the beginning of 2018.Per a new industry forecast by Staffing Industry Analysts, the U.S. staffing market is anticipated to go up by 4% in 2018 from 3% in 2017.The  is a group within the broader  . The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid growth prospects in the near term. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #62, which places it in the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Given this backdrop, let's do a comparative analysis of two staffing stocks -  and  . Korn/Ferry has a market capitalization of $2.6 billion and Kforce's market cap is $804.4 million.As the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using other parameters to provide investors a better insight.You can see Shares of Kforce and Korn/Ferry have gained 21.5% and 7.5%, respectively, in the past year. Though the stocks have gained against the industry's decline of 7.3%, Kforce clearly scores over Korn/Ferry.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.Kforce's current quarter earnings are projected to grow 26.7% year over year while that of Korn/Ferry are expected to increase 19.4%. Looking at the full year picture, Kforce's earnings are projected to grow 40.8% while that of Korn/Ferry are expected to increase 21.3%. Thus, Kforce has an edge over Korn/Ferryin terms of quarterly and yearly earnings growth expectations.The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Based on current-quarter and current-year earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days, Korn/Ferry is better placed. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Korn/Ferry's current-quarter and current-year earnings was unchanged at 80 cents and $3.30, respectively. For Kforce, current-quarter and current-year estimates declined 3.4% and 1.8%, respectively.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.Kforce and Korn/Ferry have an impressive trailing four quarter earnings surprise history. Korn/Ferry delivered higher average positive surprise of 11.5% compared with Kforce's 1.5%.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Korn/Ferry's TTM net margin of 8.9% is above Kforce's figure of 3.8% and the industry's tally of 3.7%.EV/EBITDA is a commonly used multiple for the staffing industry. We observe that while Korn/Ferry and Kforce have trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratios of 9.72 and 9.66, respectively, the industry's figure is at 7.74X. Although the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Kforce has a lower EV/EBITDA value than Korn/Ferry.So, Kforce looks cheap compared with Korn/Ferry and the industry.Our comparative analysis shows that Kforce scores over Korn/Ferry in terms of price performance and quarterly and yearly expected earnings growth. Despite a faster share price rally in the past year, Kforce is cheaper than Korn/Ferry. Korn/Ferry has an edge in terms of estimate revisions, earnings surprise history and net margin.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Paychex, Inc  and WEX Inc  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rates for Paychex and WEX are 8.5% and 15%, respectively.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

"hares of  have gained 13.8% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the 4.4% rise of the  it belongs to.The company has witnessed a 12.6% rise in share price since it posted strong third-quarter 2018 results.The company's third-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and improved 22.4% year over year. Quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion beat the consensus mark by $1.8 million and improved marginally year over year on a non-adjusted basis and 4.1% on a pro-forma basis.Republic Services has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters. It delivered average trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 3.9%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has moved up by 2 cents.Republic Services continues to grow internally with the help of long-term contracts for the collection, recycling and disposal of solid waste materials. Such agreements increase the company's contracted revenue base, thereby strengthening its market position.Further, the company continues to look out for strategic price increase in order to offset increased costs, improve operating margins and enjoy an appropriate return on its substantial investments in vehicles, equipment, landfills, transfer stations and recycling centers. The company's business stands to benefit from increasing demand for recycling of waste products.Republic Services third-quarter 2018 revenue growth includes a positive impact of 2.2% internal growth. The internal growth was basically driven by 2.4% increase in average yield, increase in fuel recovery fees by 80 basis points (bps) and increase in energy services revenues by 10 bps, which were, partially offset by decrease in total volume by 10 bps and 1% decrease in recycling, processing and commodity revenues.Republic Services is focused on increasing its operational efficiency by shifting to compressed natural gas (CNG) collection vehicles and converting rear-loading trucks to automated-side loaders, which will streamline the cost structure, improve revenue quality and enhance growth through profitable investment opportunities. Almost 19% of the company's fleet operates on natural gas and nearly 75% of its residential routes have been converted to automated single-driver trucks.The company is highly optimistic about the usage of CNG vehicles, which will help it compete effectively on grounds of maintaining a clean environment. Despite higher expenses, CNG reduces the company's overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses.The tax reform policy (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective since Dec 22, 2017) are contributing to Republic Services' bottom line. The company's third-quarter 2018 earnings included a benefit of 12 cents from the tax reform. The company enjoyed a lower effective tax rate of 22.7% for the reported quarter compared with 37.4% in the prior-year quarter. Reduced taxes will likely lead to greater retention of profits, thus helping the company to allocate more funds toward growth initiatives as well as reward shareholders through share buyback or increased dividend payments.We are impressed with Republic Services' consistent efforts to reward its shareholders. In the first nine months of 2018, Republic Services repurchased shares worth $574.9 million and paid $340 million in dividends. In 2017, the company repurchased shares worth $610.7 million and paid $440.5 million in dividends. In 2016, the company repurchased shares worth $403.8 million and paid $418.9 million in dividends. Such moves indicate the company's commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.Republic Services' balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt (net of current maturities) was $7.56 billion while cash and cash equivalents were $81.9 million. Such a cash position implies that Republic Services needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. High debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Additionally, Republic Services continues to face weak landfill pricing due to high cost of landfills and leachate. This limits the company's ability to increase prices, which is necessary to cope up with higher costs, improve operating margins and make necessary investments. This inability is likely to weigh on the company's margins and earnings, going forward.Currently, Republic Services carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Paychex, Inc  , WEX Inc  and Automatic Data Processing Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rates for Paychex, WEX and Automatic Data Processing are 8.5%, 15% and 12.5%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" prudent investment decision involves buying well-performing stocks at the right time while selling those that are at risk. Rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock's bullish run. .  is an outsourcing stock that has performed well so far this year and has the potential to sustain the momentum in the near term. The company has outperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year. The stock returned 4% compared with 1% increase recorded by the index. Paychex currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 offer attractive investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.You can see  The direction of earnings estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paychex's fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 earnings have moved up by a penny each. Paychex has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, delivering average positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings is pegged at $2.85, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.8%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 8.2% growth in fiscal 2020. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 8.5%. Paychex is a cash rich company with a strong balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter fiscal 2019, Paychex had cash and cash equivalents of $440.1 million compared with $358.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. The company had no long-term debt to clear off. The significant amount of cash provides Paychex the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy in the form of strategic acquisitions and other related investments.During fiscal 2018, Paychex completed the acquisitions of Lessor Group (""Lessor"") and HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (""HROI""). While Lessor contributed less than 1% to Management Solutions revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2019, HROI contributed around 20% to total PEO and insurance services revenues. Collectively, both these acquisitions contributed nearly 4% to total revenues growth in first-quarter fiscal 2019.Prior to this, the company had completed 13 acquisitions that helped it to expand services as well as global reach, thereby boosting its revenues.Lower tax rates as a result of the tax reform policy (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) is contributing to Paychex's bottom line. The company's first-quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of 67 cents per share improved 18% year over year. The company enjoyed a lower effective income tax rate of 24.5% in the last reported quarter compared with 34.1% in the prior-year quarter. For fiscal 2019, management is optimistic about the company's bottom line and its tax rate. Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to be up approximately 11% and effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 24%.Reduced taxes will likely lead to greater retention of profits, thus helping the company to allocate more funds toward growth initiatives as well as reward shareholders through share buyback or increased dividend payments. Notably, in first-quarter fiscal 2019, the company repurchased 0.5 million shares for $32.8 million and paid $201.4 million in dividends. During fiscal 2018, Paychex repurchased shares worth $143.1 million and paid dividend of $739.7 million. Such moves indicate the company's commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.  , WEX Inc.  and Automatic Data Processing Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

While the industry rose 9.4% in the said time frame, Zacks S&P 500 composite declined 1.6%.The company reported third-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents but rose on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $1.41 billion lagged the consensus estimate by $19.4 million but came ahead of the year-ago figure by $12 million. Adjusted revenues of $1.35 billion increased $10 million on a year-over-year basis.Fiserv has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters. It delivered average trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 1.2% upward.Fiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions. On Oct 31, Fiserv completed the acquisition of the debit-based assets of Elan Financial Services (a unit of U.S. Bancorp USB) for approximately $690 million. The deal includes the purchase of Elan's debit card processing, ATM Managed Services and MoneyPass surcharge free network. It should boost Fiserv's payments portfolio, widen its client base and provide new solutions to enhance the value proposition for its existing 3,000 debit solutions clients.In 2017, Fiserv completed four acquisitions - Online Banking Solutions, Inc., PCLender, LLC, Dovetail Group Limited and Monitise plc. These buyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions and transform payments infrastructure.We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive deals, which will boost its market share and customer base going forward.Fiserv looks well poised on the back of its diversified product portfolio. In third-quarter 2018, Fiserv's DNA platform had eight clients and expects to reach nearly 30 by the end of 2018. In the first nine months of 2018, it had more than 20 clients. Zelle had 50 new clients in the last reported quarter. Zelle transactions grew more than 50% sequentially and more than 10 times year over year. While debit transactions recorded double-digit growth, Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 23% in the last reported quarter to nearly 8 million.Further, the company seems to be actively engaged in enhancing its services. In October 2018, Fiserv announced the launch of a flexible and interactive financial planning tool (which integrates with home office systems and streamlines manual processes) to help financial advisors operate more efficiently and collaborate with clients in their investment targets. In September 2018, the company announced the launch of Originate, a new suite of solutions aimed at helping banks and credit unions deliver enhanced digital account opening and loan origination to customers.In August 2018, the company upgraded its unified managed account (UMA) services to help financial institutions and advisors operate more efficiently and announced the launch of two enhanced consumer authentication solutions, step-up authentication and identity verification to help call centers counter card fraud.The diversified product portfolio has led to a steady flow of customers, considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking and payment services.Fiserv's balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $4.82 billion while cash and cash equivalents were $673 million. Such a cash position implies that Fiserv needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. High debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Additionally, Fiserv's policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk. Acquisitions can negatively impact its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $7.25 billion or 67.5% of the total assets as of Sep 30.Currently, Fiserv is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

 prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about  , a company that has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10.4%. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 11.6% growth in fiscal 2019 and 9.9% in fiscal 2020.Also, the company outperformed the industry it belongs to year to date. Shares of FactSet have gained 18.3%, which compares favourably with 6.2% rise of the  in the said time frame.FactSet's top line is being driven by higher sales of analytics products, content and technology solutions (CTS) and wealth management solutions along with an international price increase. We believe that its growing customer base, solid revenue growth, coupled with high client retention rate (91%) and a competitive pricing strategy will positively impact results going forward. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, total revenues of $345.9 million grew 5.9% year over year on a reported basis and 5.3% organically.Growth in Annual Subscription Value (ASV) reflects the rise in revenues from FactSet's subscription services. The company is witnessing growth in ASV, driven by new client additions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, FactSet's ASV of $1.39 billion increased 5.7% year over year. Organically, it increased $38.6 million during the quarter.FactSet is strengthening its global presence, especially in the Asia Pacific region. The company opened a new office in Shanghai in May 2018 to offer its data and analytic solutions to an increasing number of investors and investment managers in China who seek better tools. FactSet's expanding global presence has been contributing to its top line. Notably, the company's ASV recorded 11% organic growth from the Asia-Pacific region and 5% from Europe in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.Despite riding on significant growth prospects, FactSet is not free from overhangs. A debt laden balance sheet may limit its future expansion and worsen its risk profile. Also, the company remains susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to its international presence. However, we believe that solid revenue growth and higher annual subscription value bode well for FactSet.Currently, FactSet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Paychex, Inc.  , WEX Inc.  and Automatic Data Processing Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rates for Paychex, WEX and Automatic Data Processing are 8.5%, 15% and 12.5%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider.

Total revenues of $925.1 million lagged the consensus estimate by $15 million but increased 16.3% year over year.Insperity has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters. It delivered average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.4%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 8.3% upward.The staffing industry is currently benefiting from a strong economy, leading to robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities, and higher corporate spending post the tax reform. The labor market has been witnessing record low unemployment levels and strong job additions since the beginning of the year.This seems to be working in favor of Insperity, which witnessed its professional employer organization (PEO) solutions revenues from the United States to grow 16.3% year over year in third-quarter 2018. The company provides an array of human resources and business solutions through its PEO services, which includes Workforce Optimization and Workforce Synchronization solutions.Insperity's top-line growth is directly proportional to the rise in average number of worksite employees paid per month. Notably, the company's third-quarter 2018 revenues of $925.1 million (up 16.3% year over year) benefited from a 15.2% increase in average number of worksite employees paid per month and 0.9% increase in revenues per worksite employee per month. Average number of worksite employees paid per month was 215,051 and revenues per worksite employee per month were $1,434 in the third quarter.Worksite employee growth is being driven by strength across sales, higher client retention and rise in net hiring of worksite employees by the company's client base.Driven by the higher worksite employee growth rate, Insperit  has raised its earnings guidance for the full year. The company now projects adjusted earnings between $3.69 per share and $3.73 per share, indicating growth of 51-52%, above the previously guided $3.49-$3.53 per share.We are also impressed by Insperity's efforts to reward its shareholders. In the first nine months of 2018, Insperity repurchased almost 212,000 shares for $16.2 million and paid dividends totaling $25.2 million. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company paid dividends of $65.8 million (inclusive of a special cash dividend of $41.7 million paid in fourth-quarter 2017), $20.6 million and $21.2 million, respectively.

Clover Mini is a small but powerful point-of-sale terminal that helps saving counter space.In Argentina, Clover works with two software solutions, Punto de Ventas (Includes order, inventory and fiscal printer) and Sistema de Pagos (includes employee management, customers and reports). Argentina is one of the early non-U.S. nations to receive Clover.With the two devices, users can manage their businesses in real-time over an online backend portal, a merchant web dashboard from a smartphone, tablet or computer.Clover's business management functionality helps with order creation, inventory tracking, customer engagement, customizing staffing and back-office tasks. Further, Clover offers access to third-party app market allowing merchants to connect with relevant business applications.Notably, First Data's shares have inched up 0.4% year to date, against the 11% decline of the  it belongs to.The new move seems to be a part of the company's bid to expand Clover globally.

It delivered average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 14.6%.Clean Harbors continues to grow with the help of multiple acquisitions in both new and existing markets. So far this year, the company has completed two acquisitions  a privately-owned company in August and the U.S. Industrial Cleaning Business of Veolia Environmental Services North America LLC (the ""Veolia Business"") in February.While the privately-owned company is expected to expand Clean Harbors' environmental services and waste oil capabilities, Veolia boosts the company's U.S. Industrial Services business. Veolia assets contributed $44.9 million of direct revenues in third-quarter 2018.Thus, acquisitions have been helping Clean Harbors expand its business across multiple lines of services and contributing to its top-line growth, thereby  acting as key growth catalyst.Clean Harbors' focus on improving its efficiency and lowering operating costs through advanced technology, process efficiencies and stringent cost management are appreciable. By setting-up additional service locations near treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs), it expects to minimize capital expenditure and increase its market share. This, in turn, is likely to drive additional waste into the company's existing facilities, thereby, increasing capacity utilization and enhancing operating profit.Notably, the company witnessed adjusted EBITDA growth of 14.9% year over year in third-quarter 2018 on the back of higher-margin waste streams. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points year over year to 16.8%.We are impressed by Clean Harbors' endeavors in rewarding its shareholders in the form of share repurchases.

n a year's time, shares of  have gained 30.4%, outperforming the 18.2% rise of the  it belongs to.The company reported strong third-quarter 2018 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings of $2.19 per share outpaced the consensus estimate by 7 cents and increased 53.1% year over year.

It delivered average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 1.9% upward.WEX's top line continues to grow organically driven by its extensive network of fuel and service providers, transaction volume growth, product excellence, marketing capabilities, sales force productivity and other strategic revenue generation efforts. Organic revenue growth was 8.4% in the last reported quarter. Strategic acquisitions complement the company's organic growth by contributing to revenues, adding differentiation to its products and service offerings and enhancing scalability. WEX remains highly optimistic about organic growth opportunities across each of its segments.WEX has been continually undertaking efforts to optimize its activities and cost structure, and capture new revenue generating opportunities across its businesses. We believe these efforts have helped WEX achieve operating income growth. In the third-quarter of 2018, operating income increased 58% year over year to $100.69 million. Operating income margin rose to 26.3% from 19.7% in the prior-year quarter.

Backed by successful apprenticeship programs in cities like Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit and San Antonio, Accenture is optimistic about extending its national program to more than 150 apprentices by the end of 2018.This innovation hub is the latest addition in the network of U.S. hubs that includes Boston, Chicago, Columbus, metro Detroit, Houston, New York, metro San Francisco and metro Washington, D.C. Internationally, recent openings include Canberra (August) and Tokyo (January) in 2018. Notably, Accenture has more than 100 innovation locations around the world.Julie Sweet, chief executive officer at Accenture North America, stated, ""Our investment in Seattle ensures that we have the critical talent and capabilities to help our clients create, implement and scale solutions for the digital economy. We are an innovation-led company, committed to helping this important market continue to grow and flourish as a tech destination.""So far this year, shares of Accenture have gained 5.5% compared with the 1.9% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.The innovation hub is expected to complement Accenture's robust growth in North America.Revenues from North America increased 11% year over year on a reported basis and in local currency in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.

hares of  have gained 16.5% in the past year, outperforming the 13.2% rise of the  it belongs to.The company recently reported mixed first-quarter fiscal 2019 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same.Adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share outpaced the consensus mark by 9 cents and surged 46% on a year-over-year basis on the back of consistent organic growth, higher event-driven revenues and a lower tax rate. Total revenues of $973 million lagged the consensus estimate by $2 million but increased 5% year over year. Recurring fee revenues of $575 million rose 5% from the year-ago quarter's level driven by organic growth and recent acquisitions.Broadridge has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 18.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year EPS has been revised 10.1% downward in the past 30 days.The company's business model helps it generate a significant percentage from recurring fee revenues, which include contributions from net new business, internal growth and acquisition-related synergies. Broadridge's diverse products and services coupled with strategic acquisitions have been boosting its top-line growth. Higher revenues are expected to drive margins and increase profits in the long run. | The company has supplemented internal growth with strategic acquisitions. So far in 2018, Broadridge acquired FundAssist Limited, MackayWilliams LLP and ActivePath. It made three acquisitions in 2017 and six in 2016. We believe that such buyouts are helping Broadridge to expand product portfolio and customer reach, besides enabling it to evolve as a leading financial and outsourcing services provider.While tax benefit will continue to support earnings growth, trends like growing demand for data and analytics, mutualization and digitization are expected to drive sales. Broadridge has ramped up investments in digital, AI, cloud and blockchain particularly through acquisitions. These investments are likely to enhance the value of the company's core product offerings and will prove beneficial in the long run. Globally, consistent demand for technology solutions should help the company gain significantly from its SaaS-based offerings.Incremental investments may offset the positive impact of higher event-driven revenues. Broadridge's frequent acquisitions could result in additional leverage on the balance sheet. The company completed acquisitions of FundAssist Limited, MackayWilliams LLP and ActivePath at aggregate prices of $47 million, $8 million and $25 million, respectively.Customer/Client concentration is a major risk for Broadridge. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, Broadridge generated approximately 21%, 20% and 25% of total revenues, respectively from its top five customers. The largest single client accounted for approximately 6%, 6% and 7% of total revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.These clients work with numerous segments. Therefore, the loss of a single client due to merger or consolidation, financial difficulties or bankruptcy, or the termination or non-renewal of contracts affects the operating performance. So, the company is always under pressure to improve and maintain client or customer relations.Currently, Broadridge is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see A few better-ranked stocks in the broader  sector include The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc  , Paychex, Inc  and WEX Inc  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Revenues came in at $333 million, which beat the consensus mark by $0.9 million and increased 9.1% year over year.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, missing estimates in two of the last four quarters. It reported an average four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 2.4%.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 2.5% upward.The company is seeing strength across state and local government business as well as international government work. It continues to win contracts and register growth in business development pipeline, a significant portion of which is represented by disaster recovery. In the last reported quarter, the company gained a $5-million contract to provide on-the-job training services in the U.S. Virgin Islands affected by hurricanes in 2017. The company is well positioned to receive additional contracts because of raised fiscal 2018 and 2019 civilian agency budgets and the recent buyout of DMS. | Acquisition is an important element of ICF's growth strategy. So far this year, the company has acquired We are Vista, a U.K.-based creative communications agency; DMS Disaster Consultants, a disaster planning and recovery services firm; and The Future Customer, a boutique loyalty strategy and marketing company. While the acquisition of We are Vista is expected to strength the company's global marketing, technology, communications and digital services portfolio, DMS should improve its disaster response, recovery and preparedness offerings. Acquisition of The Future Customer has extended ICF's loyalty business to Europe.A considerable portion of ICF's business comes from commercial work that is highly concentrated in cyclical industries like financial services, energy, air transportation, retail, health and environmental. Therefore, demand for the company's services decline when these industries experience downfall, which is likely to continue in the future as well. As the company has expanded its work with commercial clients, considerable variations in revenues and profits are expected from time to time with ups and downs in the global economy.Moreover, ICF could see escalation in costs. The company plans to make significant investments in capture and proposal activities, infrastructure and intellectual property development, loyalty program and acquisitions.

Revenues of $1.28 billion outpaced the consensus mark by $11 million and increased 6.2% on a year-over-year basis.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters. It delivered average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 1.7% upward.Waste Connections continues to grow its top line with the help of acquisitions in both new and existing markets. In the first nine months of 2018, the company completed the purchase of 15 individually immaterial non-hazardous solid waste collection, recycling, transfer and disposal businesses.We appreciate Waste Connections' focus on secondary and rural markets to garner a higher local market share, which will be difficult to attain in more competitive urban markets. This decreases the company's exposure to customer churn and helps improve financial returns.Waste Connections enjoys optimal asset positioning as its disposal sites are located at prime locations, which helps it generate higher profitability. Considering the importance of costs associated with the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites, having disposal capacity close to the waste stream offers a competitive advantage.We are also impressed with Waste Connections' endeavors to reward its shareholders with dividend payments and share repurchases. In the first nine months of 2018, Waste Connections paid $110.44 million of dividend and repurchased shares worth $42 million. Such moves indicate the company's commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.Waste Connections' balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $3.90 billion while cash and cash equivalents were $244.39 million. Such a cash position implies that Waste Connections needs to generate an adequate amount of operating cash flow to pay its debt. Moreover, high debt may limit its future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Stringent environmental and health and safety laws have been hindering the company's operations and raising its operating costs. Revenues are highly seasonal in nature with the lowest in the first quarter. The expected revenue fluctuation between the highest and lowest quarters is roughly 10%.

etting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Based in Rochester, Paychex (PAYX) is in the Business Services sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -1.32%. The payroll processor and human-resources services provider is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.56 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.33%. This compares to the Outsourcing industry's yield of 0.98% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.9%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.24 is up 8.7% from last year. Paychex has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 9.80%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Paychex's current payout ratio is 90%. This means it paid out 90% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PAYX expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.85 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.76%.Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that PAYX is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing. The majority of the technologies used by Verisk are developed, maintained and supported by almost 20% of its employees. Its efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying client demands and its technical prowess in analytics and Big Data provide Verisk an edge over its competitors.Higher organic revenue growth through a combination of increase in new customers for existing solutions, cross-sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and the sale of new solutions will help Verisk create long-term value. In the first nine months of 2018, total revenues grew 7% organically and 6.3% on an organic constant-currency basis. This marks an improvement from 2017 when total revenues grew 4.5% organically and 5.3% on an organic constant currency basis.Moreover, Verisk continues to earn a major portion of its revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements. In the first nine months of 2018, Verisk's three reportable segments: Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services generated a respective 81%, 78% and 72% of revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements for its solutions.Acquisitions have also been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. In 2018 so far, the company has acquired three companies -Validus-IVC Limited on Jun 20, Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5. While the buyout of Validus will help improve and automate the claims settlement process, the other two acquisitions will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.Verisk's balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $2.04 billion while cash and cash equivalents was $147.6 million. Such a cash position implies that Verisk needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Since Verisk's business model centers on huge amount of data, it remains susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches at its facilities, computer networks, and databases, resulting in loss of its credibility and/or customers. Dependence on external sources for data supply can lead to contractual and pricing issues with data suppliers (some of them are also its rivals).Verisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

nvestors with an interest in Outsourcing stocks have likely encountered both TTEC Holdings (TTEC) and Paychex (PAYX). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system.

The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TTEC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.20, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 23.86. We also note that TTEC has a PEG ratio of 2.28. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.81.Another notable valuation metric for TTEC is its P/B ratio of 4.14. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 10.22.These metrics, and several others, help TTEC earn a Value grade of A, while PAYX has been given a Value grade of D.Both TTEC and PAYX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that TTEC is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"here's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy. Back on October 24, Paychex Inc's Director, Joseph Doody, invested $129,900.00 into 2,000 shares of PAYX, for a cost per share of $64.95. Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. In trading on Monday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) and achieve a cost basis even cheaper than Doody, with shares changing hands as low as $64.62 per share. Paychex Inc shares are currently trading up about 1.4% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of PAYX shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, PAYX's low point in its 52 week range is $59.40 per share, with $76.02 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $64.93. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which  was recorded over the last six months:

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (Symbol: SPLV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $53.12 per unit.With SPLV trading at a recent price near $47.69 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.39% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPLV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX), AFLAC Inc (Symbol: AFL), and Republic Services Inc (Symbol: RSG). Although PAYX has traded at a recent price of $64.16/share, the average analyst target is 14.50% higher at $73.47/share. Similarly, AFL has 13.75% upside from the recent share price of $42.70 if the average analyst target price of $48.57/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting RSG to reach a target price of $78.60/share, which is 13.53% above the recent price of $69.23. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of PAYX, AFL, and RSG:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Forecast 11% Gains Ahead For SPLV@2018-10-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-forecast-11-gains-ahead-splv-2018-10-25
"he consulting services industry is currently benefiting from improving economy, reduced tax rates, robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity. At the same time, it is bearing the brunt of higher talent costs due to a competitive talent market coupled with Trump's stringent policies on immigration.We believe that the macro drivers should offset operating challenges encountered by the industry in the long run. In fact, looking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the border economic recovery is enhancing investors' confidence in the industry.The  , which is a stock group within the broader  , has outpaced the S&P 500 and its own sector in the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 14.4%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Business Services Sector have rallied 7.2% and 9%, respectively.Given this backdrop, let's do a comparative analysis of two consulting services stocks -  and  . FTI Consulting has a market capitalization of $2.6 billion and Navigant's market cap is $1 billion.As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight.So far this year, FTI Consulting has performed impressively on the bourse compared with Navigant and the industry. While FTI Consulting stock has surged 57.5%, Navigant and the industry rallied 14.5% and 6.3%, respectively.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's solid prospects.For 2018, FTI Consulting's earnings are projected to grow 41% year over year, while that of Navigant are expected to decrease 60.7%. Thus, FTI Consulting has an edge over Navigantin terms of yearly earnings growth.While FTI Consulting's earnings estimate remained unchanged at $2.27 over the past 60 days, the same for Navigantmoved south 41% during the same time frame. This reflects increased pessimism surrounding the Navigant stock.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a solid net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Even though readings for both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry's figure of 10.2%, FTI Consulting has a lead with TTM net margin of 7.4% compared with Navigant's 6.2%.Comparing the companies with each other and the industry on the basis of price to forward 12 months' earnings, we see that Navigant's 27.01X is ahead of FTI Consulting's 20.39X and the industry's 21.95X.In terms of price to forward 12 months earnings growth, we see that Navigant's 2X is again ahead of FTI Consulting's 1.7X and the industry's 1.91X.So any way you cut it, Navigant is overvalued than FTI Consulting and the industry.Our comparative analysis shows that FTI Consulting scores over Navigant in terms of net margin and expected earnings growth for 2018. Its share price performance year to date has also been relatively better. Despite this share price rally, FTI Consulting's valuation looks cheap compared to Navigant.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include ICF International, Inc.  and Paychex, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for ICF International and Paychex is 10% and 8.4%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

hether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Paychex (PAYX) is headquartered in Rochester, and is in the Business Services sector. The stock has seen a price change of -0.21% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.56 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.3%. In comparison, the Outsourcing industry's yield is 1%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.93%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.24 is up 8.7% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Paychex has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.80%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Paychex's current payout ratio is 90%, meaning it paid out 90% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for PAYX for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.85 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.76%.From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that PAYX is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

he U.S. staffing industry is benefiting from promising developments in the broader economy. The labor market has been witnessing record low unemployment levels and strong job additions since the beginning of the year.While the economy continues to create new jobs despite the 18-year low jobless rate, a tight labor market is compelling companies to pay higher to attract and retain employees. Higher wage growth, a tightening labor market and a low unemployment rate indicate a bullish economy.Trump administration's business-friendly approach, including tax cuts and higher government spending act as major growth catalysts for the improvement of the overall economy, which in turn inspires optimism about growth of the staffing industry.Per a report by  , U.S. staffing industry has shown steady improvement over the past few years. From $119.4 billion revenues in 2013, the industry's top line grew to $142.8 billion in 2017. For 2018, revenues are anticipated to be around $148.3 billion and exceed $150 billion in 2019.Given these promising developments in the industry, let's undertake a comparative analysis of two such stocks - Insperity, Inc.  and ManpowerGroup Inc.  . While Insperity has a market capitalization of $4.72 billion, ManpowerGroup's market cap is $5.36 billion.As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight. You can see So far this year, shares of Insperity have gained 98.4%, significantly outperforming the 1.9% rise of the  it belongs to. However, shares of ManpowerGroup have declined 37.9% in the same time frame.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.Insperity's current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 43.9% compared with 18.1% for ManpowerGroup. Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Insperity's earnings are projected to grow 43.7% while that of ManpowerGroup are expected to increase 21.9%. For 2019, Insperity's earnings are expected to register 12.6% growth compared with 2% for ManpowerGroup.Thus, Insperity has an edge over ManpowerGroup in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.Insperity and ManpowerGroup have an impressive earning surprise history, with Insperity's earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters. ManpowerGroup's earnings outpaced the consensus mark in three of the past four quarters.However, Insperity has delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise of 18.2% compared with 2.9% for ManpowerGroup.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.While Insperity has a TTM net margin of 3.1%, the same stands at 2.7% for ManpowerGroup. Though both the stocks compare unfavourably with the industry's figure of 3.3%, Insperity has a higher TTM net margin than ManpowerGroup.The Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is considered better than a higher one.ManpowerGroup's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 9.5 is lower than Insperity's 40.2. It also compares favorably with the industry's ratio of 17.3.The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company's valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.ManpowerGroup's EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.5 not only compares favorably with Insperity's 25.2 but also with the industry's ratio of 8.5.Considering both the valuation metrics, we observe that ManpowerGroup is not only cheaper than Insperity but also undervalued compared to the industry it belongs to.Our comparative analysis shows that Insperity scores over ManpowerGroup in terms of price performance, quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth, earnings surprise history and net margin.A faster share price rally on a year-to-date basis has led to a rich valuation for Insperity compared with ManpowerGroup Some top-ranked stocks in the broader  include WEX  , ICF International  and Paychex  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for WEX, ICF International and Paychex is 15%, 10% and 8.4%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider.

"hares of  have gained 30.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the 3.9% rise of the  it belongs to.Clean Harbors continues to grow with the help of multiple acquisitions in new and existing markets. Acquisition of the U.S. Industrial Cleaning Business of Veolia Environmental Services North America LLC (the ""Veolia Business"") contributed $63.9 million of revenues in the first half of 2018. The buyout is also expected to help Clean Harbors increase its industrial services capabilities and expand its U.S. Industrial Services business.In 2017, Clean Harbors completed four acquisitions, which contributed revenues of almost $14.5 million and helped the company in multiple lines of services such as waste minimization, remodeling of its fleet of trucks, growth in daylighting and hydro excavation services markets. It also complemented its closed loop model in relation to the sale of oil products.Clean Harbors' focus on improving its efficiency and lowering operating costs through advanced technology, process efficiencies and stringent cost management is encouraging. It continues to make capital investments to enhance quality and comply with government and local regulations.Additionally, the company eyes strategic investment in businesses, which are likely to increase productivity.  By setting-up additional service locations near treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF), it expects to minimize capital expenditures and increase its market share. This, in turn, is likely to drive additional waste into the company's existing facilities, thereby increasing capacity utilization and enhancing overall profitability.With several facilities on the Texas Gulf Coast, Clean Harbors provides a broad range of services such as end-to-end hazardous waste management, emergency spill response, industrial cleaning and maintenance and recycling services.We believe this has helped Clean Harbors gain popularity as a leading emergency response firm through dedicated staff and integrated facilities.Currently, Clean Harbors carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about  , a company that has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.7%. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 15.7% growth in 2018 and 13% in 2019.So far this year, shares of Waste Connections have gained 10.2%, outperforming the 3.9% rise of the  it belongs to.Let's find out what's driving the stock and why investors should retain it in their portfolio.Waste Connections' top line continues to grow with the help of acquisitions. In the first half of 2018, Waste Connections witnessed annualized revenues of approximately $175 million from acquisitions. Acquisitions contributed almost $1.05 billion of revenues in 2017 and $1.27 billion in 2016.The company follows a combination of financial, market and management criteria to evaluate opportunities from acquisitions. It is highly optimistic about ""tuck-in"" acquisition opportunities within its current and targeted market areas as these can help increase market share.Waste Connections focuses on providing vertically integrated services, from collection through disposal of solid waste in landfills that it owns or operates. In addition, the operations are managed on a decentralized basis to place decision-making authority close to the customer.This enables the company to identify and address customers' needs on a real-time basis and in a cost-effective manner. This low-overhead, highly-efficient operational structure allows it to expand into geographically contiguous markets and operate in relatively small communities that its competitors may find unattractive.We appreciate Waste Connections' endeavors to reward its shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases. In the first half of 2018, Waste Connections paid $73.6 million of dividend and repurchased shares worth $42 million. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company returned $131.9 million, $92.5 million and $65.9 million to its shareholders, respectively, through dividend payment.In 2017 and 2016, the company did not make any repurchases. In 2015, it repurchased shares worth $91.2 million. Such moves indicate the company's commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.Despite significant growth prospects, the company remains susceptible to seasonality and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A debt laden balance sheet may limit its future expansion and worsen its risk profile. However, we believe that operational efficiency and strategic multiple acquisitions bode well for Waste Connections.Currently, Waste Connections carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Some better-ranked stocks in the broader  include Core-Mark Holding Company  , ICF International  and Paychex  .

Despite record low jobless rate, the economy continues to generate new jobs. A tight labor market is propelling companies to pay higher to attract and retain employees. Trump administration's business-friendly approach, which includes tax cuts and higher government spending, is a major growth catalyst for the overall economy. This raises optimism related to growth of the staffing industry. All these factors are driving Robert Half. Moreover, lower tax rates as a result of the 2017 tax reform policy (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are contributing to the bottom line. The effective tax rate is anticipated in the range of 25-26% for 2018.Robert Half has been allocating a major portion of capital expenditures on investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure. Major software initiatives include upgrades to enterprise resource planning applications and the implementation of a global, cloud-based customer relationship management application. Further, the company continues to invest in digital technology initiatives designed to upgrade the service offerings to clients and candidates. In line with this, the company concluded the global rollout of CRM software in 2017 and launched a website recently.

 is benefiting from a booming professional employer organization (PEO) industry and rise in average number of worksite employees paid per month.In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 66%, massively outperforming the 1.6% growth of the  it belongs to.With an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 18% and a market cap of $4.8 billion, Insperity seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio for now.Insperity looks promising backed by a booming PEO industry. Notably, it offers a comprehensive suite of HR services' solutions through PEO services known as Workforce Optimization and Workforce Synchronization solutions. With the help of these solutions, Insperity serves small and medium-sized businesses in selected markets across the United States. In second-quarter 2018, Insperity's PEO solutions' revenues from the United States grew 15.9% year over year. This marks an improvement from 14.9% revenue growth in first-quarter 2018. In 2017, the same increased 12.2% year over year.Apart from PEO services, Insperity is focusing on its Workforce Administration solution that provides human capital management and payroll services solution. By implementing Workforce Administration as the prime element of its next five-year plan, the company plans to offer the same as the most-integrated traditional employment solution in the market. In fact, Insperity remains highly optimistic about growth opportunities arising from Workforce Administration and Workforce Optimization.Insperity's top-line growth is directly proportional to the rise in the average number of worksite employees paid per month. The company's second-quarter 2018 revenues totaled $922.3 million (up 15.9% year over year), courtesy of a 13.1% increase in the average number of worksite employees paid per month and a 2.4% increase in revenues per worksite employee per month. Average number of worksite employees paid per month was 203.9 million and revenue per worksite employee per month came in at $1,507 in the same quarter.Worksite employee growth is benefiting from strength across new client sales, higher client retention and rise in net hiring of worksite employees by the company's client base. | Despite riding on significant growth prospects, Insperity is not free from headwinds. The company continues to face high competition in the PEO industry and its earnings are seasonal in nature. However, we believe that worksite employee growth bodes well for Insperity and will continue to boost its top and bottom lines.Currently, Insperity carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

" (NYSE:  ) isn't the kind of company that you find splayed out in the pages of most investment letters or financial publications. It's one of those ""boring"" stocks that operates in an industry that doesn't get much attention.But if 62% return in 12 months, or a 33% return year to date for an industry leading company with a $8 billion market cap sounds like your idea of an exciting investment, well, WEX is your stock.The company was started in 1983 in South Portland, Maine, as Wright Express. Initially it started as an issuer of fleet cards to the commercial and government car and trucking fleets. Now, its business has expanded into the healthcare and travel sectors as well.While this may seem like a pretty straightforward business with a business cycle that rises and falls with the fortunes of the economy, that isn't where WEX stock finds itself today.The fleet card business is pretty straightforward. Say you are a business - whether you're a trucking firm, a furniture store or an electric utility - that has a fleet or fleets of vehicles. Maybe it's to move other people's products, or deliver your merchandise, or get your people around their territory.Regardless, those vehicles need gas and also need maintenance. Instead of having each driver use their own money to make their runs and then reimburse them all - a bookkeeping nightmare - the business owner gets a fleet card it hands out to its drivers.The fleet card pays for gas, maintenance or whatever else each owner decides the cards can be used for while the workers are on the clock.WEX stock has become a significant player in this space, which means it has also developed significant skills in payment processing and information management solutions. This has helped WEX transition its fleet business into other sectors like healthcare and travel services.So, now you have a company that operates in the trucking business which is exploding because of the rise in e-commerce and same-day delivery services. It operates in the rock-solid and expanding healthcare sector. And it's also a key player in the global expansion of the travel industry through online travel agencies (OTAs).In the latter category for example, WEX works with  ,  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) as well as others. These are some of the biggest names and most important brands in global travel.Its healthcare division helps manage payments through HSAs, HRAs, COBRA, FSAs and various other plans between healthcare providers and the companies that manage these plans. Clients include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  .And then you have the original logistics division which is seeing a complete shift and expansion in its model. The fact is, for a ""boring"" company, WEX stock is pretty darned sexy.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@WEX Stock Still Has Room to Grow@2018-10-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wex-stock-still-has-room-grow-2018-10-08
 is benefitting from focus on improving solution offerings and platforms, which is aiding the company to grow organically.With expected long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 9.1% and a market cap of $4.7 billion, Stericycle is a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio now.Let's take a look at the factors that bode well for the company.Stericycle continues to grow on the back of acquisitions in the domestic and international markets. A global acquisition strategy boosts the company's customer base by providing a long-term growth platform for offering multiple services.In the first half of 2018, Stericycle completed 15 acquisitions, which contributed $15.2 million to top-line growth. In 2017 and 2016, Stericycle completed 30 and 31 acquisitions, respectively. Further, acquisitions contributed $570.1 million and $32.2 million to 2016 and 2017 revenues, respectively.Stericycle's efforts toward internal development bode well. The company is improving solution offerings and platforms to meet customer demands more effectively. This has enabled Stericycle build a strong and loyal customer base, having a revenue retention rate of nearly 90%.The company is trying to grow by selling additional services to the existing ones as well as attract new customers on the back of strong client relationships. | Stericycle provides assistance to customers and businesses to comply with the tough regulatory policies. It mainly focuses on smaller businesses with high demand for regulatory assistance compared with larger businesses, due to the lack of specialized staff. To this end, the company is offering services, depending on varying customer needs.We believe that this business strategy will help the company earn profits as well as expand into additional service offerings like hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management, communication services as well as secure information destruction.In spite of significant growth prospects, Stericycle is not free from headwinds. The company is susceptible to pricing pressure due to intense competition. It has a debt-laden balance sheet that may limit future expansion and worsen risk profile. However, we believe that internal growth, strategic acquisitions and strong customer base bode well for Stericycle in the long term.Currently, Stericycle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ll investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Headquartered in Rochester, Paychex (PAYX) is a Business Services stock that has seen a price change of 6.33% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.56 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.09%. In comparison, the Outsourcing industry's yield is 0.98%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.81%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.24 is up 8.7% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Paychex has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.80%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Paychex's current payout ratio is 91%, meaning it paid out 91% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for PAYX for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.85 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.76%.Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PAYX presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This marks an improvement from 2017, wherein total revenues grew 4.5% organically and 5.3% on an organic constant currency basis.The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries.

This is helping First Data to globalize its offerings and increase their receptivity. | The acquisition of BluePay, Acculynk and CardConnect have led to significant additions to First Data's product portfolio. While BluePay will allow the company to expand its market share in the high-growth integrated payments space, Acculynk is expected to enhance First Data's extensive payments portfolio. The CardConnect acquisition will help First Data to boost its financial technology capacities.First Data's Enterprise Business is also in good shape and expanding through client wins. The company differentiates itself in this space by consistently offering new features and solutions to existing clients apart from making continuous efforts to expand its client base.Despite riding on significant growth prospects, First Data is not free from overhangs. The company remains susceptible to seasonality, acquisition-related integration risks and foreign exchange risks.

" is benefitting from strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, which will help the company grow in the long run.With expected long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 7.5% and a market cap of $15.9 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio now.Despite troubles related to data breach, the company has registered a 4.1% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018.Let's take a look at the factors that bode well for the company.The company undertakes strategic acquisitions to strengthen the core business.In July 2018, Equifax acquired DataX, a leading specialty finance credit reporting agency and alternative data provider to lenders. In 2017, the company acquired ID Watchdog, one of the leading providers of identity theft protection and resolution services to the Employee Benefits marketplace. In 2016, Equifax completed the acquisition of Veda Group Limited, the leading Australian credit information provider.These acquisitions are expected to drive the top and the bottom line in the long run. | Equifax has shown great interest in joint ventures that will expand its business internationally. Joint ventures (""JVs"") keep operating costs down and require no integration time during the diversification of the revenue source.The company merged credit reporting operations of its Brazilian subsidiary with Boa Vista Servicos S.A. to harness the immense growth potential of the Brazilian credit data market. Boa Vista, the second-largest consumer credit bureau in Brazil, and Equifax own 15% equity interest in it.Additionally, the company also owns around 50% stake in Russia-based credit reporting agency, Global Payments Credit Services LLC, and 49% interest in the Indian credit reporting agency, Equifax Credit Information Services Private Limited (a JV between Equifax and six Indian financial institutions).Equifax deploys advanced statistical techniques and proprietary tools to analyze all available data and create customized insights, decision-making solutions as well as processing services. This helps customers understand, manage and protect their clients' information and make more informed financial decisions. We believe that a solid product portfolio and a clear understanding of the sector will keep Equifax stay competitive.The cyber breach faced by the company, through which the perpetrators stole highly-sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million, has heavily tarnished the brand image, reputation and credibility of Equifax. The company is bearing the brunt of higher costs as it has increased spending on technology post the incident. However, we believe that synergies from acquisitions along with continued general consumer credit activity, product innovation, initiatives to boost enterprise growth and efficient business executions will boost growth in the long run.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, it is experiencing solid improvement in international government work and stable revenue growth from federal, state and local government clients.ICF looks well poised for additional contract wins in the federal government market because of the raised fiscal 2018 and 2019 civilian agency budgets, approved earlier this year. During the second half of 2018, the company anticipates RFPs to be issued by civilian agency clients.In the commercial business category, demand remains strong across the markets that it serves.Within the commercial business, marketing service is benefiting from increased focus on digital commerce and social media as well as loyalty marketing. ICF's commercial energy markets group also looks well poised to benefit from advisory work connected to transformations in the utility industry and increase in mandated energy efficiency programs across the United States.The company's recent acquisition of disaster planning and recovery services firm, DMS Disaster Consultants, should improve its disaster response, recovery and preparedness offerings and help it expand further into the state and local government markets.Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader  include Broadridge Financial Solutions  , Paychex  and Convergys  , each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for Broadridge Financial Solutions, Paychex and Convergys is 10%, 8.2% and 7.5%, respectively.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.20 lagged the consensus mark by 2 cents but improved 15.8% year over year. Revenues of $345.9 million missed the consensus mark by a slight margin but rose 5.9% on a year-over-year basis.Nevertheless, FactSet has an impressive surprise history. It beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 1.9%. For the first quarter, the consensus estimate for earnings declined marginally in the past 30 days.The company continues to grow organically on the back of higher sales from international price increase and analytics, data feed products as well as workstations. In the reported quarter, organic revenues improved 5.3% to $347.1 million, primarily owing to accelerated sales of content and technology solutions (CTS), analytics products as well as wealth management solutions. Region-wise, FactSet reported 5% organic growth from the United States and 6% internationally. The company's ASV organic growth rate was 5.7% in the reported quarter.In a bid to strengthen global presence, the company has recently opened a new office in Shanghai to provide data and analytic solutions for an increasing number of investors and investment managers in China. Notably, the company's ASV recorded 11% growth from the Asia-Pacific region in the last reported quarter. The region also witnessed new client addition and higher sales to existing clients.Moreover, FactSet is enjoying robust growth across the European operations as it generates around 25-27% of revenues from the region.

".S. stock markets were mixed on Tuesday as investors are busy weighing the positive and negative outcomes of trade-related developments.

On Sep 30, the United States and Canada reached a landmark deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new trilateral agreement will now be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Notably, Mexico has already given its nod in the August.The USMCA is very important for strategic reasons as these two countries are immediate neighbors of the United States.

However, Italy accused the EU of imposing ""economic terrorism"" by linking the economic conditions of both Italy and Greece on the same platform. EU's behavior has raised the cost of funds of the country, it alleges.Meanwhile, in the UK, at the ongoing annual conference of the Conservative Part, delegates are discussing the new proposals of Prime Minister Theresa May about future UK-EU relations.

The deal should result in incremental revenues and earnings opportunities and boost profitability metrics on a pro-forma basis. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Interpublic's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the year after the deal closes.Acxiom, which accounts for almost 8% of the combined entity's revenues, is likely to diversify Interpublic's revenue base through client additions and effective execution of business.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: PAYX)Q1 2019 October 2, 2018, Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Paychex's First Quarter . At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2018. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days.This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today's call, I will review the business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for Fiscal 2019. And then we will open it up for your questions.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Paychex wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!We have had a good start for Fiscal 2019 and our financial results reflect growth across our major product lines. Our total revenue growth was a solid 9% for the first quarter. Beginning this quarter, we are changing from our traditional disclosures, as Efrain talked about last quarter, of the service revenue categories or payroll and human resource services, and are now reporting service revenues as management solutions revenues, or PEO, and insurance services revenues. This new revenue segregation provides a better representation of how our business has evolved to the selling of more bundled products, and Efrain will provide more information about this in his commentary.You may recall, last fiscal year, we implemented certain go-to-market strategies for sales, which began to gain momentum in the back half of the year. That momentum has continued for the first quarter, especially [audio cuts out] HR Outsourcing Services, both in our PEO as well as our traditional ASO/HCM service bundle. We have also continued to add to our salesforce and are fully staffed as we head into our upcoming peak selling season.With regards to client retention in the first quarter, we are very pleased with the continued increase in this metric for retention as well as our strong client satisfaction performance. August 18th was the anniversary of our acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc., or HROI, a national PEO. HROI continues to perform well and has integrated very well into the existing PEO sales and service organization of Paychex.We also acquired Lessor Group, a payroll and HR services provider headquartered in Denmark, at the end of February 2018. Lessor is performing well and we are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities that these acquisitions provide us. At the HR Tech Conference in September, we premiered our Paychex brand refresh, which focuses on the power of simplicity. This renews our commitment to our customers to make their lives easier by alleviating the complexity of payroll, HR, benefits, and insurance. Paychex has over four decades of experience working with businesses to solve their complex challenges, and everything we do is focused on making it simpler for our clients to run their businesses through a combination of our leading technology, our breadth of product offerings, and our personalized service options.At HR Tech, we also introduced Paychex Learning Management, a web-based learning management system that provides employers with a simple and affordable learning tool. Paychex Learning Management features access to hundreds of preloaded learning modules, allows clients to create their own new materials, and upload existing training material specific to their industry or workforce. It is also integrated with our performance management solution, which recently underwent a user experience update.In our current environment of record low unemployment and a war for talent, employers need every advantage they can for recruiting and retaining employees, and our comprehensive suite of HR products can help employers recruit with an attractive benefit package, and our new LMS offering helps with the retention of talent by providing ongoing engagement and professional development.We also showcased additional new enhancements and features within our HR product suite. We now offer tablet enabled facial recognition for time and attendance, and the new Paychex Flex Assistant, a chatbot for commonly asked HR related questions. These are examples of our ongoing commitment to continually introduce advancements in technology that evolves and enhances our clients' experience and makes it more valuable to them across all of our services.We are pleased with our progress in retirement services for the eighth consecutive year. Paychex was named by  as the leader in total number of defined contribution plans as we now serve well over 80,000 plans. Paychex Retirement Services meets the needs of businesses of all sizes by delivering next level efficiency with full Paychex HCM integration, fee transparency, plan accessibility across devices, flexibility in investment options and fiduciary solutions, and personalized participant support.We also ranked number 20 as the 20th largest business insurance agency in 2018, in their top list of 100 brokers in the US. This is up one spot from last year. This is our eighth time on this list as well, and is a testament to our best in class insurance agents who continue to deliver customized solutions to meet the evolving needs of business owners and their employees. Value rich insurance coverage plays a key role in both hiring and keeping key talent.I'd also like to note that, for the sixth consecutive year, we were recognized by  as one of its 50 best companies to sell for, in fact ranking number three. We have been making significant investments in our salesforce, including new technology support tools and more sophisticated demand generation to improve the quantity and quality of the sales leads to support our salesforce and their success. We continue to also provide value to our shareholders. Our quarterly dividend is currently at $0.56 per share, with a last increase of 12% this past April.In summary, our state of art technology full suite of integrated HCM product offerings and personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth in our markets. Our employees make this combination successful with their hard work and commitment to our clients each and every day.I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? -- Thanks, Marty, and good morning. I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings release that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to the press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures. The investor slide presentation should be up and it has a lot of supplemental information on it.As mentioned previously, effective for this fiscal year, we've adopted a new revenue recognition guidance in ASC Topic 606. We've adopted under the full retrospective method, so prior year results have been restated to conform with this guidance. After the previous  in June, you'll recall that I held a supplemental call to introduce the impacts of this new guidance on our financial results. On our IR page, we've published an updated presentation from that call, and that gives quarterly information on the financial impacts of ASC 606 and other non-GAAP adjustments for the past two years.Overall, the changes from adoption of the accounting standard are not significant, but they do have a modest effect on the quarterly periods. This presentation also reflects the impact of tax reform and non-GAAP measures. In connection with the adoption of the new guidance, the categorization of our service revenues is evolving. In prior years, we disaggregated service revenue into two buckets -- payroll service revenue and human resource services revenue. As our business has evolved, selling more bundled products, this disaggregation has become less meaningful. ASC 606 requires disaggregation of revenues to reflect how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are impacted by economic factors.Given how we manage our business, and the risk inherent in various services, we've decided that a more meaningful presentation is the categories of management solutions revenue and PEO and insurance revenue. Management solutions revenue includes payroll, and HR, and employee benefits products that are better reflective of offerings in our product bundles. So, this presentation includes our previous category of payroll services, together with retirement services and HR administration solutions, including our comprehensive HR service bundle. This presentation represents our integrated HCM services.PEO and insurance services revenues have similar operational economic characteristics. Both involve the provision of insurance benefits to clients. PEO revenues also reflect a gross up for certain of our insurance offerings to PEO clients. During this transition period, I want to emphasize this will provide information on service revenues under both our previous and new classification. So, you'll have that information. You'll have the ability to adjust your models as you go forward. And there is information on our Investor Relations site. It provides both as reported disaggregation of revenue, payroll and HRS, and the revised disaggregation of revenue management solutions and PEO and insurance services for the past few years.Now, with that preface out of the way, I'll provide some of the key highlights for the quarter and then provide greater detail in areas. And, as usual, I will touch briefly on the results and wrap with the review of the Fiscal '19 outlook. Total revenue and services grew 9% for the first quarter, to $863 million and $846 million respectively. The growth was aided by the acquisitions of HROI and Lessor. More to come on those.Expenses increased 14% for the first quarter. The acquisitions of HROI and Lessor together contributed approximately 6% to the total expense growth for the first quarter. Accelerated investment in sales, marketing, and product development as part of tax reform investments and PEO costs were major factors in expense growth.Operating income increased 1% to $320 million. Operating margins were 37.1% for the first quarter. Margins were impacted by acquisition expenses, increased investment initiatives, higher growth and PEO costs, and the composition of payroll processing day.Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% for the first quarter compared to 34.1% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year in the effective tax rate is, of course, due to tax reform legislation. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be approximately 24% for the remainder of the year.Net income increased 16% to $244 million for the first quarter, and adjusted net income increased 18% to $242 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.67 for the first quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67.I'll provide some additional color now in selected areas, and start with a discussion of service revenues, and we'll discuss results under our previous categories and our new service revenue categories. Under our previously reported categories of service revenue, payroll services revenue growth was 1% for the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Organic growth related to pricing for the first quarter was offset by the impact of client size mix and the composition of payroll processing days within he quarter. If you recall, in June, I indicted that payroll revenue growth for Q1 would be below the low end of the range of our guidance.HRS revenues grew 18%, approximately 12% excluding the HROI acquisition. This growth is due to the growth in clients across our HR products, in particular Paychex HR Services, ASO and PEO, and retirement services.Now, let's talk about management solutions revenue. This includes, as I discussed previously, payroll service revenue together with other HCM products included in many of our product bundles. Management solutions revenue increased 3% to $688 million for the first quarter. This increase was driven by growth in client bases across our HCM services, including payroll, ASO, retirement services, and time and attendance solutions. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the asset value participants' funds. The acquisition of Lessor contributed less than 1% to this growth. The growth was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable composition of payroll processing days in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Same thing that I mentioned on payroll.PEO and insurance services revenue increased 39% to $158 million for the first quarter. We acquired HROI near the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2018. The incremental impact of HROI accounts for approximately one-half of this growth. The remaining growth was primarily driven by continued strong demand for combined PEO services as we continue to experience strong growth in the number of client worksite employees. In addition, our insurance services revenue benefited from growth in the number of applicants.Interest on funds held for clients grew 25% for the first quarter to $17 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. And, just to pause there for a second, we have assumed that there would be fed rate increases in this fiscal -- there will likely be more. But we only included two in our plan. The first occurred last month, and we anticipate there will be one more. At least, that's what's contemplated in our plans. As we get to midyear, we'll talk a little bit more about what our expectation is based on where the fed is at that point.And turning to our investment portfolio, our goal, as always, is to protect principle and not optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipals bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%. Average duration is 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.8% for the first quarter, up from 1.4% last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down modestly for the first quarter, primarily driven by impacts of tax reform and client employee withholdings partially offset by wage inflation.I'll now walk through our thoughts on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $788 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients vary widely, as you know, on a day-to-day basis, and averaged $3.7 billion for the first quarter. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $36 million as of August 31, 2018 compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018.Total stockholders' equity was $2.4 billion as of August 31, 2018, reflecting $201 million in dividends paid and $33 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 45%. Please note that our return on equity calculation was adjusted to reflect the impacts of the adoption of ASC 606. At Fiscal 2018 year end, we reported 46% return on equity, which would be actually 44% on restated basis, because of those changes made by ASC 606.Cash flows from operations were $274 million for the first quarter. It was a decline versus the prior year quarter. The change was primarily a result of timing impacts within working capital, largely related to income taxes, and our PEO payroll and related unbilled receivables for payrolls not yet processed as of the reporting date offset by higher net income.Fiscal 2019 guidance -- now, I'll turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2019. I'll remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our guidance for Fiscal 2019 is unchanged from what was provided in June, which was given reflecting adoption of the ASC 606. Under our previous revenue categories, there's no change to payroll revenue guidance in the range of 2-3% and HRS revenue guidance in the range of 10-11%.Payroll services revenue was below the low end of the range in the first quarter, as anticipate, due to the composition of payroll processing days. Growth in payroll revenue will be at or above the high end of the range for Q2 and Q3, and Q4 is anticipated to be within the range. HRS revenue growth for the first quarter was significantly higher than the range due to the timing of the HROI acquisition. Growth for Q2 and Q3 is anticipated to be within the range, for Q4 growth as anticipated to be below the low end of the range due to a more challenging compare caused by the strong growth in the PEO in the latter part of Fiscal 2018.We'll also provide you with revenue guidance under our new categories as we transition to this approach in the future. Management solutions revenue is anticipated to grow by approximately 4% for Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018. Our Q1 results were obviously lower than this due, as I mentioned before, to the composition of payroll processing days. We anticipate that Q2 and Q3 will be above 4%, and we anticipate that Q4 will be in line with the full year guidance.PEO and insurance services revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 18-20%. Growth in the first quarter was obviously significantly higher due to the timing of the HROI acquisition. We anticipate that growth for Q2 and Q3 will be in the range of 15-17%, and for Q4 in the range of 11-13% due to the factors that I mentioned before due to a challenging comparison with strong PEO growth in the latter part of Fiscal 2019. All other guidance remains unchanged.Finally, just as a reminder, we have provided on our IR website a presentation entitled Service Revenue Disaggregation, which reflects historical revenues as originally reported and as they would be under the new categories. We've also published an updated presentation entitled Impacts of ASC 606 and Other Items that reflects the impacts of adoption of 606 and other non-GAAP adjustments for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018.With all of that, I will turn it now back to Marty. -- All right. Thank you, Efrain....Operator, we'll now open up the call to questions, please.Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Solid results. I just wanted to ask about the margins that came in a little bit better than expected, and wondering if that had to do with some timing of investments. Because I think the full year operating margins were reiterated. -- Yeah, Bryan. I'd say that investments into one were a little bit lower -- they were planned that way, so this wasn't different. Investments were a little bit lower in first quarter than they will be in subsequent quarters. That was one. And then, revenue was a little bit better than we had originally anticipated in the quarter. So, the combination of those two drove margins a bit better than we anticipated. -- Okay. And then, just in particular on ASO and PEO strength, it looks like those trends continue. In particular, just curious if there are any callouts. And then, Efrain, when we get toward the end of the year, I know it gets a little more challenging on comps. So, does that mean that that 11-13% is a more normalized range for the PEO business and insurance business as we go forward past this fiscal year? -- Bryan, I knew when I put out that number in those ranges, just so everybody could be centered, I'd get that question. I don't know the answer to that at this point. I think I'll talk to that as we get closer to Q2 and Q3. We had an exceptionally strong back half of the year, so I'll have to see. We have some momentum in PEO and we have a degree of conservatism in the way we look at the information. So, I'll hold out on commenting on whether that's the run rate going in the next year. Your first question was any callouts on PEO? I'll just let Marty -- -- Yeah, Bryan, I think just that we continue -- as Efrain just said, we had a strong back half of last year. That continued right into the first quarter. We're finding a lot of success with the PEO and ASO both from an HR outsourcing perspective. And the integration with HROI has gone very well and, frankly, has complimented us in our teams and the leadership, I think, very well. So, we've really picked up -- continued to have some great momentum in the first quarter. So, right now, the callouts are that there's a great need for the PEO and the ASO products and we're capturing the sales for that need. So, we're very pleased with the work that those guys have been doing. -- Okay. Helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. -- Sure. -- You're welcome. Thanks.Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please go ahead. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystThank you. Good morning. -- Hi, David from Stifel. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystHi. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you could go back to the PEO for a minute. I don't know if you could just focus on the PEO, excluding the other insurance business, but can you help us understand the components of the growth that you're anticipating for this year broken down? How much of that is unit growth, versus passthrough, versus maybe pricing and other items that may be impacting the growth rate year-over-year. -- You know, David, here's what I'd say. What we're experiencing is strong growth in worksite employees that continued into first quarter. So, it's not primarily pricing driven. It's really much more driven by volume of clients. So, we're not anticipating any significant step up in the rate of attach on healthcare. So, it's not it's getting a little bit more contribution from passthroughs. It's really more volume driven. I got a lot of calls -- we got a lot of questions about whether our worksite employee growth was real, or how real it was and -- or how sustainable more than how real. We had strength in the back half of the year and that's continuing as we start the year. -- Yeah, I think you can really see it in -- when you think about it, worksite employee growth is double digits as well. So, it's continued to be very strong. Not only the sales from new sales, but also the existing base is continuing to grow. So, we're getting a little uptick on the economy from those slightly larger businesses -- I guess, I'd say midmarket sized PEO client. -- And, David, one other thing that I'd like to add, because this is probably not what was true five or six years ago. We get a lot of PEO clients outside of the base. So, when you see the growth, a lot of that's coming from outside the Paychex payroll base. So, we're winning both inside the base and outside the base. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystAnd, just to confirm, the way your disclosure is set up, the actual WSE growth that you're quoting now is an organic number, right? Because you had HROI at the end of last -- the fiscal first quarter of last year as well, correct? -- WSE growth or revenue growth? -- Worksite employee growth. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystWSE growth. -- Yes. I'm sorry. -- Organic is double digits. -- Yes. Yes. Correct, David. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystRight. Got it. Okay, great. And then, just to -- you gave us some good guidance on the growth and the cadence as the year goes by. Do processing days normalize at all as the year goes on, or is that just this year, or a one-quarter, issue with no real impact to the balance of the year? -- We never recover that one heavy processing day, and the impact on payroll services revenue is about $5 million from that one day. So, we never recover it. And then, you have the normal ups and downs you might have in a given quarter, which is why the other quarters look so different from Q1. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystAll right. So, just 1Q is the $5 million and nothing else through -- -- [Crosstalk] Yeah, just to be clear, because I'll get this question. We're not saying there's one less day. It's really just the composition of a heavier processing day in Q1 that we lost, and then the rest of the year is normal, which will mean you've got some a little bit more in one quarter, a little bit less in other quarters, but it'll look like a normal year. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystGot it. And then, just one last quick question on the competitive dynamic. A nontraditional competitor came out with a revised payroll solution during the quarter. I think it's been out there, so it's really not terribly new. But, I guess the reason I bring it up is that in the past, point of sale usually goes in a small business before payroll. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that. If in fact a point of sale competitor comes in with a stronger solution, and how that may impact you given that, typically, the cash register, if you will, goes in before the payroll system. -- David, this is Marty. You're absolutely right. That's how it's always been. Of course, other competitors have been out there with those solutions for a while. This one is not a new one. A lot was made about it, but it's a mobile version of something they've had for a number of years. It doesn't support all the states. It's not as complex, obviously, as opposed to our offering. You have to do payroll many days ahead. So, at least, in this instance, I don't see it as any big change from a competitive standpoint. And, you're right, in that point of sale -- typically, because we're also selling through a partner those payments solutions, we find that is something that they take upfront and then payroll comes along a little bit later. So, we've experienced that ourselves. So, we can be selling it -- we actually unseat more payment solutions because they already have them before they ever talk about payroll with us.So, we don't see that as a big change at this point. Again, a number of competitors have been out there and this one really wasn't that big of a change, or anything close to the competitiveness that we have. It's a mobile payroll solution. It doesn't, I don't believe, even have employee access, which is what many companies are looking for now on a mobile basis. -- And, just more concretely -- building on what Marty said. Look, we have a really competitive offering the microenterprise space, and we'll be talking as we go through the year about some really significant enhancements of that product that we think will put us certainly at the forefront of what's happening on the low end of the DIYSS part of the market. We're doing really well in that part of the business. It was really, really surprising to us, the reaction that occurred as a result of that because we don't see any of that in our numbers. As a matter of fact, in the past six months, we've been building momentum in that part of the market.So, everyone's entitled to make their own opinion as to what a press release makes. Unfortunately, from the standpoint of the facts, we're not seeing any impact. So, I just want to make that very clear. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystThanks for that, but I guess the follow-up related to that -- does this change at all your appetite to be in the merchant acquiring business? Or has that really not changed? -- No. I mean, we're selling and our sales have done very well. We have inside team that sells through a couple of partners now, and has continued to do well. But, as far as getting into a full-fledged -- doing the processing itself of the payments -- I don't think so. There is not a great interest there. As you know, the company dynamics are very different. The financials are very different. I don't think it makes a huge difference from the payroll side, on the frontend. Frankly, we've had better experience with having the payroll and then unseating an existing competitor in the payment space because those rates constantly are changing and we can give them a little bit better product. And frankly, sometimes it offsets the cost of payroll or other products. So, we're in it, but I think we're in it at the right level right now. --  ,  & Company, Inc. -- AnalystAll right. Got it. Great. Thanks very much. -- Thanks, David.Our next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Two questions on the PEO business. One is somewhat of a follow-up. The WSE growth had double digits versus the 19% organic growth. It seems -- double digits doesn't sound quite as high as 19%, so what's the revenue per WSE. Maybe talk about that in terms of that dropping incremental growth. I'll stop there first. -- Yeah, so we don't disclose the revenue per WSE number, Tim. We will talk to that as we go through the year. It doesn't sound impressive because when we said organic was 19, remember that the base now, including HROI, increases the number of WSEs. It's still pretty strong. So, I wouldn't take that as an implication that growth is somehow decelerating because now, when we talk about organic, we're talking about the inclusion of HROI in the base, which adds more WSEs. So, we're talking about a more apples-to-apples comparison. And then, as we walk through the year, we'll talk more about revenue per worksite employee. -- Is the implication of that last comment that, I guess, HROI wouldn't be growing as fast as your organic? Is that what you're saying -- now that it's rolled in -- -- No, the implication of that is that now you've got a larger base on which to calculate growth. So, the 19% was on the Paychex business itself. That was the organic comparison. And now, we roll in the HROI base to our clients, and so the growth rate, obviously, is a little bit lower because you have a bigger base on which you're calculating the growth. -- Yeah, and we didn't really mean to imply that double digits means at the low end of double digits. -- Yeah. -- Okay. And then, a broader question. You're breaking PEO and insurance out into a separate segment. I get it's somewhat driven by the revenue disclosures, but also even just this call -- a lot of discussion of this business and you've talked about a lot of momentum in it. Yet it's still a smaller piece relative to your business. I know it's been clearly an area of expansion. Should we read anything into how important this is going to be strategically to Paychex in terms of your focus and where the investment dollars are going over the next three years, given all of those factors? -- Well, I think you certainly could read into it that we think that's an important part of our business going forward. The HR Outsourcing has been very important, and the PEO has picked up momentum the last two or three years in particular, even from the client standpoint, from accepting what a PEO is and understanding. The competition that's out there, I think, has also helped drive that -- understanding what a PEO is and how that can assist them. The changes in insurance have driven that. So, yeah, I think you'll see us continue to make investment in that business and we do think -- we wouldn't break it out as a segment with insurance unless we thought it was certainly a significantly growing piece of the business. And it adds different dynamics, obviously, to the financials that we'd like to call out as well. -- Okay. Thank you. Actually, one more on that -- the dynamics part. Sorry to raise the question. Just, the margins on that side of the business? Can you comment at all? Is it different versus the other segment as we think about the growth of that side of the -- -- [Crosstalk] Hey, Tim. So, we'll talk more -- this is the first quarter reporting on it. But, obviously, because PEO is bundled with insurance -- well, not bundled with insurance, but presented with insurance -- and PEO has passthrough costs, it's lower than the overall company margin. And management solutions is higher. We'll have to go through the year and see where rates normalize, but it's fair to say it is lower than overall company margins. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Okay.Our next question will come from the line of James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the question related to the crossover. You've made it clear that you feel like merchant acquiring, etc., is a different business. But, I am wondering if there is opportunity, or how you think about the selling motion to continue to make sure that Paychex has the best opportunity to win the business where you do want it, especially the way people are setting up new businesses, etc., seems to be changing. -- I hope I got the question. You mean, specific to the payment business -- payment with payroll? -- Yeah, just as people are starting to think about it as they set up new business, especially smaller businesses, that may be looking for a one-stop shop. I can understand what you're talking about in terms of where merchant acquiring maybe doesn't fit within Paychex. But, I think perhaps what people are expressing some concern about is what that selling motion looks like or needs to look like so you can get the best opportunity to win new business. -- Yeah, I think we are very much at the frontend. I would just say our experience has been that, with the payment solutions -- that we do a payment solution through two partners. We're, I think, very effective at it. That sales team has grown. It's all an inside team, so we get referrals from the field and we have, of course, one of the largest field-based selling teams out there in payroll and HR. And so, when we run into brand new clients, we can certainly refer them back to that team to sell payment now and then build a relationship to payroll. But we also, more times than not, have payroll first and then unseat the payment solution.On the other hand, I would tell you that a lot of the work that we're doing now on the frontend is to be able to get at those clients where they come to us on the Web. So, you're seeing a lot more web-based -- coming in through the web and then selling them whatever they need at that point, whether that's payment, payroll, or a combination of that with HR. So, I think we're well positioned, very much, to get those businesses at the frontend of when they're searching. And more of our dollars, frankly, have shifted to marketing, and web development, and demand generation than any time in our history -- because of that. Because of the way the whole sales approach is.And Efrain mentioned, SurePayroll, a component of ours out of Chicago, is also -- we're working on some things that we'll be releasing and talking about the next quarter or two, that I think will help that even more. -- The other thing is, we have been involved with merchant services over the past five years. And I think we have a pretty good understanding of the dynamics of how that sale occurs and how it occurs with payroll. So, I think, between SurePayroll and what we do on the merchant side, we're in a position to see if that starts to tilt or tip, and take the appropriate action. Right now, though, I just want to emphasize that we're not seeing that. And a lot of the dynamics that we saw five years ago still remain. Now, what happens in the future we'll monitor and see what's going on. -- Great. That's really reassuring. On your online customer acquisition and referral efforts, and what you're putting in there, any even qualitative color you can share with us about the effectiveness of that versus the traditional salesforce, and maybe how that has been changing, and what kinds of further improvements you may be able to make, at least on what those metrics look like? Thanks. -- Yeah, sure. I think it's been a very significant change, particularly over the last year. We've moved more leads to a virtual team inside for the smallest of clients. Those were starting up one to four. We use more virtual teams, or telephonic sales -- because that's the way the client in those small areas in particular -- their leads come in, they want to be addressed very quickly. We've really become much more sophisticated in our lead generation, in the way we're scoring leads, and then communicating with prospects who aren't ready to buy yet. Those used to all be kind of in a bucket with all the leads being the same. That is not the way it's done anymore.We know when someone just comes in. We know where they start and stop looking at our product. We know if we've been compared to somewhere else. We know if they've looked at pricing or not. And we can respond telephonically much faster, with much better data targeted right at that client. And we're set up to demo and sell over the phone, or through chat, very quickly. So, the dynamics have changed quite dramatically, particularly for the inbound web search and low-end client. And I think we've really -- last year, we started this toward the beginning of the year, or actually in the fourth quarter of the year before, and we really have picked up momentum in the last six months. I think we've really finetuned this to where it's working very well. -- That's great color. Thanks, guys. -- Okay. -- Thank you.And our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Marty, if you could talk through -- I think you touched on some of them, but maybe talk through the remaining product and service initiatives you've got under way for the fiscal year. And maybe share what goals you might have in terms of retention rates exiting this fiscal year. If you could give us any color on that, that would be great. -- I'll start with the latter. Certainly, our goal is always to be at the best we've ever been. I think we're approaching that from a client retention level. First quarter doesn't make the year, but we certainly have seen continuous improvement in the -- our net promotor scores and our satisfaction surveys, which have then translated into even better retention. We went through a pretty big service realignment two years ago that really settled out through last year, and we feel like all of that is behind us now and has worked very effectively in how we're servicing clients in different ways with different teams.We've also added a lot of technology for the retention. So, we put in a whole new unified communications system across all of our branches and locations. We collect a lot more data. I know a lot more about the clients, what they're looking at, and what their history has been before I ever talked to them when they're calling in. And, of course, we've continued to use a lot of data analytic models to anticipate if a client is possibly going to leave us or not and then do proactive calling to them. So, our goal is certainly to have the best retention ever in our history, and we hit that peak about two to two-and-a-half years ago, and we're slightly below that and aiming for more.From a product standpoint, Jim, we're very -- at HR Tech just a few weeks ago, we released, as I mentioned, the Paychex Learning Management. That tied training into development, so now we have a fully bundled development. So, you can think about it all the way from acquiring new employees for our clients. We can do all of that in a paperless fashion, right from the recruiting to the onboarding of the client, so there is no paper necessary. Once they're in the system, now we've been much more full featured as far as training them, developing them, giving turnover data analytics of what's going on in the environment. I think the data and the enhancements have never come faster.And then, adding more self-service. The other thing we're seeing is, a lot of clients wanting self-service. So, if they have questions, or their employees have questions, or their employees want to make changes, we allow them to do that in the app, whether mobile or on the desktop. They can make changes. They can ask questions. We'll be introducing a chatbot that we showed at HR Tech, that will service 50-60 answers to questions. All you have to do is, ""Where's my W-2,"" or, ""Where do I find this,"" or, ""How do I do that,"" and that'll pop up. And you'll see that continue to evolve throughout the year. -- That's helpful. Maybe a corollary question to that is, are you seeing those initiatives now starting to translate to higher bookings at this point? I know you don't give the precise booking figures, but is there a way to quantify how much higher bookings were this quarter than say a year ago quarter? -- Not without giving it to you, but a good try anyway. I would just say we had some momentum going into the last half of last year. We feel like that has continued. So, selling season is the peak and we're fully staffed up on our sales team. We did that very quickly. We added some additional sales. We have added more to virtual, to telephonic, as well. Both field and telephonic -- and I think we're well positioned for peak selling season product wise and sales wise. And, by the way, I didn't even mention, the sales team has a lot more tools as well. So, when you think about the use of Salesforce and how sophisticated Salesforce has not become for them, it's amazing the tools that are at their disposal. And the ability to train and get them to use it is coming much better too.They're seeing that, when they give us data on a prospect that maybe didn't close this time, they're getting a lot more information back the next time they go out and talk to CPAs, current clients, etc. So, it's starting to translate. Wouldn't quite call it the year yet, because we have to get through that peak selling season. But, we're feeling really good about where we are now. -- Well, I had to try. Thanks very much, though. -- Okay. All right.Our next question will come from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, Tien-tsin. -- Good morning. Thanks for the slides. It's all very helpful. Just a couple of quick clarification questions and then I have a strategic question. Within the PEO side, I heard you mention that it's more new rather than existing. But, are you taking preexisting PEO clients and converting to your own, or are these first-time PEO clients? I'm just trying to understand the end market dynamics. -- Yeah, I don't have a good split between previous -- obviously, you get a lot outside the PEO who know PEO. So, we're doing well there. And the split, as to new to PEO, I don't know. My suspicion is it's more people who know about the PEO model to start with. But I do want to say -- just reiterate, Tien-tsin, what you said, which is as we looked at the data we always had a certain amount of PEO clients outside the base. But, that trend has certainly been accelerating. -- Gotcha. It seems that way. But then, within core payroll, I know the segmenting is changing. But, as we go into 2Q-3Q, you mentioned it would be at the high end or above the range. Is that just a function of the processing days? Are there any other drivers -- pricing, units, retention -- that you might see? -- Yeah, yeah. It is a function of the days, but our assumption is that through the year we build in terms of sales units and sales volume as we progress through the next three quarters. As Marty said, we're off to a decent start this year. -- Got it. So, it's a backlog conversion. Okay. Great. And then the last one -- for you, Marty -- I have a question on freelancers and that whole market. I'm curious if that's an area of focus, for you to potentially go after that freelance market? -- I'm not sure -- -- 1099 -- gig -- -- Oh, I'm sorry. The gig economy. Yeah, I -- -- The gig economy -- sorry. -- That's all right. -- It's a trendier word to use. -- I think we're well prepared for that. We've been building out -- a number of the products I'm looking at are from a strategy standpoint of how do we look at, from an insurance, retirement, savings, and payroll -- but even more so, from the benefit side -- how do you look at ways to let that follow the employee as opposed to being so client focused, the employer focused? And I think we'll have some things to talk about in future quarters as we're rolling that out. We're not seeing a big impact from that right now. I think it was a little bit overstated last year, but we're certainly preparing for that. I think, already, with the mobile app and the way we're building out the data by employee, you're going to see much more of a shift toward the employee and how they can carry information with them. We'll be prepared to react to that as it continues to grow. -- Very good. Thank you. -- Okay. All right. -- Thanks.[Omit attempt to connect caller] We'll move on to the next question. It comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Good morning, guys. How are you? -- Good morning, Jason. -- Good. -- Good. So, I had a question to follow-up on core payroll. Thanks for continuing to give the disclosure there. I just wanted to try and break down the pieces because it seems like there's a few moving parts. So, I guess, it seems like the tailwind from Lessor was more or less offset by the one less processing day. So, if that's right, you have about this 1% underlying revenue growth. It does sound like pricing is still a tailwind. I know it had been running around 2%. So, I'm just trying to figure out the implications for organic client count, because qualitatively it doesn't sound, based on what you're saying, that that metric would be down year-over-year. But, what are the other pieces here? Is this an average client size issue or is organic client count down? -- No, no, no. No, it isn't. -- Okay. -- And I don't typically give quarterly, but I can say no. No, it's really client size, and that abates as we go through the year. We anticipate it will abate in addition to all of the other factors changing as we go through the year. We have another day. We assume better unit and volume growth -- all of those and mix of dates a bit. So, it's those factors. -- Are you running at about 16 on the average client size now? -- We're between, I think -- 15-16 is where we ended up -- the client base last year. -- Okay. Can you just talk a little bit about what the differences may be in the pricing trends between renewals of existing clients versus pricing for new clients that you're bidding on? And, at a high level, are you still running at around a 2% pricing uplift? -- Yeah. You want to take that? -- No, go ahead. -- I think, that would be -- our anticipation is still two to three -- we've always said two to four, but tend to recognize a little on the lower end of that. I think, on new clients, you're seeing some discounting there upfront, but we're able to roll that off very effectively and pretty quickly through using a lot of data analytics. We started this a number of years ago, but instead of leaving it to individual branches to decide how to roll off discounts, we do it on a much more automated basis and it's done with data analytics. So, we know based on the history of the client whether we can roll off more of a discount or less of a discount. And that has been very effective for us at bringing the price -- the discount back off.So, you're still seeing pretty much the same level of competition upfront, which drives a little bit more of the discounting -- or the same level of discounting. But, we're able to roll that off. And, I think, between the service levels, the additional products we offer -- all of that allows you to drive more revenue per client after you have the client. And, once you have the client, the price increase seems to stick pretty well. So, the more of that discounting is more upfront to get the client in a competitive environment, but not as much once you're going forward. -- Okay. Thanks for the commentary, guys. -- Sure. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. -- Sure. -- Just one for me. I was wondering if you could talk about the talent acquisition. You did mention, Marty, in your script about how you're fully staffed up on the sales headcount increase that you were looking for. But, just in general, across your organization, how has it been finding talent? Maybe if you could spend a little bit of time on finding the sales talent as you upped your investments. Thanks. -- Yeah. Interesting question. I think it's still been pretty good as far as finding -- I know there's the shortages -- that are more difficult to find based on the work that we do in the overall market, as well as Paychex itself, is more in the IT side. And we've actually been very successful there too. But that's where -- when you get into certain disciplines of IT security and so forth, that's been difficult. Sales has not been too difficult. I think, one, we're attracting good, solid sales folks. Typically, we still look for that some sales experience already, and they're seeing the level of products and success that we're having. They're seeing growth opportunities that, when they come into the company, they could start. And, frankly, in virtual telephonic, they can grow to the field payroll. They can advance to midmarket. They can grow into HRS.In fact, we just came back from our sales conference two weeks ago, and just tremendous enthusiasm and a lot of good employee referrals. So, we're really not having an issue of getting fully staffed. In fact, we got fully staffed faster than we expected in the first quarter because of the success in the recruiting. And the retention is improving across virtually every sales organization. So, the retention is getting back in line with where we were historically as well. I think that's all about them feeling like they've got the right tools -- Salesforce, the enhancements we've made to that; the lead generation that they're getting; the leads and that they can be successful. All of that equates well to acquiring and retaining the talent. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Rick.And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please go ahead. -- All right. Thank you so much. This is going to be really quick. I know you're not directly impacted by all the noise regarding tariff wars, etc. Are you seeing, though, any hesitation from your clients that might be impacted, that could indirectly impact you? -- Not at this point. We're not seeing much. There certainly are specific small and midsized businesses that are impacted, whether they're supplying the automobile industry and so forth. But, we have not seen much of an impact on our client base at all. And, when you think about also, when we saw the storm impacting an awful lot of businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina, we haven't seen too much of an impact there yet, either. So, so far, retention is in very good shape, as I mentioned earlier, and we're not seeing an impact, either from regulation and tariff changes or the hurricane. -- Okay, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. -- Sure. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question this morning. A couple of follow-ups to some of the answers. You mentioned a lot of new tools for the sales organization. I was wondering if maybe you could dig deeper into what those are and how much you're factoring in productivity increases from these tools into the forecast for this year. And then, I have one follow-up. -- Yeah, I think when you think about -- like Salesforce. We've had Salesforce for some time, but we've really added a team that has worked with the sales team to encourage them to find it to be much more useful. So, we've gotten a lot more into the analytics of Salesforce, and we've also profiled the clients and the leads that they're getting much better. So, let me start with the leads. When the leads come in -- in the past, as I mentioned, they were in kind of one big bucket. So, all of the leads that came in that had interest went out to the salesforce, and they may have been of different quality. We started with a new leader in marketing with a lot of experience in demand generation, and started making these much more sophisticated.We're scoring the leads now at the frontend. We have a team that has been talking to leads for some time, taking them through the web, etc., and now scoring them. And if they don't score high enough, they're put back into the system to get worked and continue to provide information and details to prospective clients before we send a salesperson out to them. So, we're seeing that the quality of the leads to the sales team is much better. As the sales team continues to use Salesforce and gives us more data on their prospects, that goes back into data analytics that then helps us profile the clients -- also profile the CPAs, and give you more data on the CPAs and what's the last time that they referred us, who referred us, how they referred us, what they referred us -- all giving the sales rep much more data to go out and approach either a prospective client, a current client for referral, a CPA, or other lead referral source.You're also evolving into giving them a lot more data on their mobile phone as to where their next appointments are, how they make the best use of their time, and how they can then get data off of social media on those prospects so that, when I walk into a prospect, I know a lot about them already from our internal resources and combining that with external resources. So, the level of sophistication, and the tools that we give them, has increased dramatically just even in the last 6-12 months. And we're starting to see some benefit from that one -- I think better retention of the salesforce, and certainly we're looking for improved productivity as well. And it's a little early in the year to talk about that, but so far, as we have said a number of times, we think we're off to a good start. -- That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a follow-up, with that in mind, and then some of the commentary about nontraditional competitors and customer acquisition -- I'm curious if you've seen a change in your customer acquisition costs as you move more to virtual and/or your nontraditional competitors try to spend aggressively in building their merchant base. I'm just curious what you've seen in your customer acquisition cost trends. -- Yeah, I would say, first of all, not in the merchant base. Again, it seems like that got an awful lot of play and we just haven't seen that there. I think it's just not really much of an impact, at least at this time. We have seen the shift of dollars have definitely gone toward marketing. So, where you would necessarily put dollars more in to sales, we continue to put dollars into sales -- but I have to say some has shifted earlier in the process. So, redesigning our web, redesigning the whole lead flow that I just talked about, data analytics and the work in building those support systems -- more money goes into, and investment goes into, the marketing side.And overall, that probably does raise the cost of acquiring a client to some degree, certainly. But you're also getting more productive on the sales side -- or that's your hope. So, you're getting more revenue, and more success, and a higher close rate as a result of that. But, you're definitely doing more upfront and the spend is much more upfront to get that. That's just the way they're searching. Most client prospects today are 60% of the way through the sales process before we even get contacted. That's very different than in our past. And we think we're very much ready for that. -- That's very helpful. Thanks, again, for taking my questions. -- Sure. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. On the service revenue disaggregation slide that you put out earlier this week -- or last week, rather -- I was wondering if you could speak to the drop-off in growth for the restated HR Management Solutions revenue from Fiscal '17 and '18? It goes from 6.1 to 2.9 -- -- [Crosstalk] Yeah, I'll just make that really quick. So, what happens there is that because we bundle into that revenue the impacts from modules related to The Affordable Care Act, you didn't see that growth in that number. So, that number started to tail off. We penetrated the base and that part of the module, which a couple of years earlier started at basically zero, didn't grow very much. So, that dropped off in growth. And then, the second thing was the impact of payroll services revenue growing more slowly as seen in that number.You'll see, if you look at the numbers that we're projecting in terms of growth for the remainder of the year, that we bounce back off that number that we had last year and we start to see better growth in the back half of this year. But those are the reasons -- growth in payroll, growth in that one category, was muted. -- Okay. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. I know last quarter you guys talked about organic growth guidance being 1.5% for payroll and then 9-10% for HRS. Are you able to provide those numbers for the new segmentation? -- We repeated it. It should be on the website. We break out management solutions and PEO and insurance, and then we just reaffirmed the guidance that we provided for the full year. -- On an organic basis? -- On an organic basis. Yeah, I think what we said, James, was that Lessor would be about 1% of payroll growth. -- Okay. All right. Thank you very much. -- Okay.Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning, Efrain and Marty. -- Good morning, Kartik. -- Good morning. -- I wanted to go back to -- I think, Efrain, you were talking about client growth. I'm just wondering if you could talk about maybe -- is there a difference in the client growth you're seeing between your traditional payroll and mature payroll? So, in essence, are you seeing client growth in both? And is one greater than the other? -- We don't break out the client base between them anymore, Kartik. But, I think both are growing. You certainly see, as Efrain said, on the low end of both companies a stronger growth. We really feel like that has picked up a lot of momentum, particularly on the low end. And I think that's a lot of the things that we've been talking about -- the demand generation, the virtual sales team, the faster response to leads, doing it with chat, and selling over the phone much more. So, I think both of them are doing well. Certainly, Sure has continued to see good growth as well. We're really pleased with the team there. -- And just lastly, on the PEO side, any thoughts on price competition? It seems like that business is really growing well, so I'm assuming it's attracting all of the competitors into that space. Any worries on that becoming a little bit more price competitive as we go through this fiscal year? -- Yeah, always some concern with that. But, I think right now, what you see in those kinds of clients that are taking a PEO solution is, they're much more interested in the service that they're getting and the support for the insurance in particular. And they're looking at those costs -- do you have the right insurance plans, and do you have the right service with the HR generalist. And we have 500 of those out there that are supporting PEO and ASO. Do they have the right experience? It's really much more of a value play, so frankly I worry less about that price competition than I would small business payroll, which is much more competitive.So, the more that we grow toward the PEO side, from a price standpoint, I think that the value is much stronger to say -- hey, we hear plenty of clients that say to us this was -- having a strong HR person and this insurance plan was very valuable to my business. And they probably pay more. -- Thanks, Marty. I appreciate it. -- Okay, Kartik.And the last question that we have in queue, comes from the line of Matt O'Neal with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. -- Hi, Matt. -- Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. It's actually already been answered, so I thank you for the time. -- Yep. Okay. Thank you. -- Thanks.And we have no further question in queue at this time. -- All right. Thank you. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days....Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Paychex currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of In order to see if PAYX is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this payroll processor and human-resources services provider holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For PAYX, shares are up 1.17% over the past week while the Zacks Outsourcing industry is up 1.53% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 1.84% compares favorably with the industry's 1.16% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Paychex have risen 8.76%, and are up 22.99% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 7.79% and 18.79%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to PAYX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PAYX is currently averaging 1,635,762 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PAYX.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PAYX's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.83 to $2.84 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PAYX is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Paychex on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"One of the most popular investment strategies is to focus on fast-charging growth companies. The appeal, of course, is that you can get in on the ground floor of a paradigm-shifting industry. But remember the adage  . The most dependable stocks to buy are usually what people call ""cash cows.""While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a business' lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. That's why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.Another reason to look at a company's money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options. They can choose to put money to work through key investments, or to expand operations.And if the worst happens, and the underlying industry hits a recession, cash cows can better weather the storm. Because of this dynamic, you'll want to at least peek at the cash flow statement for your target investments.Below are the eight best cash cow stocks to buy now:I'm going to make a confession straight off the bat. I don't understand why people eat at  (NYSE:  ), particularly those who do so regularly. Admittedly, they make great coffee and their French fries are to die for, but the rest of it? Not quite so appetizing.Nevertheless, I don't need to understand a phenomenon to recognize that it's working. Moreover, those who are looking primarily for reliable stocks to invest in should seriously consider MCD stock. Last year, the iconic fast-food company generated nearly $5.6 billion in cash flow from operations. In their most recent quarter, MCD produced $1.34 billion in operating cash flow, up over 10% from the year-ago level.Additionally, McDonald's enjoys consistent FCF every year, offering invaluable confidence in a rising, but unpredictable market. Plus, MCD pays out a 2.5% dividend yield, which management should have no problems sustaining.We often say that there are two guarantees in life: death and taxes. In reality, we should add a third, which is random events that conspire to ruin your day. Whether it's a massive accident or a debilitating illness, stuff happens. When it does,  's (NYSE:  ) insurance products can help you or your family recover financially.It's amazing how much a relatively common occurrence, such as a broken leg, can add up to serious  . Just for the consistent demand, AFL should be on most people's list of stocks to buy. And as you might expect, Aflac enjoys robust cash flows from operations. Last year, the insurance provider generated $6.1 billion. It also has FCF that averaged over $6 billion over the past four years.AFL is one of those conservative stocks to buy that have performed well in the markets. On a year-to-date basis, shares are up nearly 9%. Better yet, Aflac pays out a 2.2% dividend yield. Steady growth and passive income? AFL is too good to ignore.If you're asked to come down to the human resources department, chances are, it's for unpleasant reasons. Nevertheless, HR plays a crucial role as it deals directly with a company's most valuable asset: people. You can never go wrong with experts in this field, which is why  (NASDAQ:  ) is a consistent winner.But another factor boosting PAYX is their product flexibility. Despite their big-name brand, they offer  for virtually any organization. From tiny businesses with only a lone employee to major, multinational firms, PAYX can tailor-fit an effective, efficient platform. That will come in handy over the next few years as new businesses focus on agility rather than brute size.As you might expect, Paychex features a healthy balance between growth and cash flows. In the most recent quarter, PAYX rang up $871 million in revenue, up 9% year-over-year. It also generated $288 million in cash flow from operations, up nearly 51% YOY.The video game sector offers some of the best stocks to invest in. Thanks to gaming culture and tournaments going mainstream, this is an industry that will perpetually rise higher. Over the longer-term, this presents a viable tailwind for  (NASDAQ:  ).Admittedly, though, the ride in ATVI hasn't been an easy one. While its YTD performance is nearly 26%, shares have gyrated severely multiple times. Investors have an understandable concern that they're buying into ATVI near at or near its highs. Moreover, Activision has suffered significant competition; namely,  ' ""Fortnite.""Still, I'm not worried. In terms of first-person shooting games, ATVI is still the king. Its ""  "" series is legitimately a cash cow. Furthermore, Activision's financials have consistently demonstrated rising cash flow from operations. That might take a hit this year due to the competitive environment.However, don't count out ATVI. Not only can Activision leverage its own strengths in shooter games, ""Fortnite"" mania  .Out of all the cash cow stocks to buy,  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) stands alone. One of the chief reasons why is due to the company's prevalence across multiple lucrative markets. From laptops to cloud computing to driverless-vehicle technology, GOOG disrupts any sector it wishes.But the biggest reason I like Alphabet is that it  . I realize that it's a tired argument because everybody has mentioned it. That doesn't mean, though, that the argument is any less valid. For instance, we all know that Google is the  . But the gap between first place and second-ranked Bing is a whopping 66%!Moreover, Google is the unquestioned leader of mobile and tablet search engines with a 93% market share. In order to get anything done online, you essentially must go through Alphabet. And if your company doesn't rank well on Google, you're dead in the water.Oh yeah …GOOG features blistering cash flow from operations. Last year, it pulled in $37 billion, and in the most recent quarter, GOOG delivered $10.1 billion.On the surface, it appears big tobacco firms like  (NYSE:  ) face a double-whammy. First, Americans are  . Also, the under-18 crowd isn't taking up the habit like prior generations had. Second, the vaping market has exploded in popularity thanks to its cleaner platform.Naturally, PM stock has taken a big hit in the markets. On a YTD basis, shares have lost nearly 23%. Still, I don't think it's over for Philip Morris. For one thing, several markets, including the eastern Mediterranean and Africa, have witnessed a  . That of course suits PM perfectly, which is the international arm of the iconic tobacco firm.Second, PM is intently focused on  , which is a type of vaporizer. What makes IQOS distinct from the vaping competition is authenticity. PM understands the nuances that smokers are looking for, and they seek to replicate that experience in a digital platform.Best of all, Philip Morris is a cash-rich organization. Last year, it delivered $8.9 billion in operating cash flow, and it's on pace for $10 billion this year. That provides substantial confidence in the company's generous 5.6% dividend yield.Thanks to an unpredictable political environment, and an extremely-competitive atmosphere, several pharmaceuticals have underperformed this year.  (NASDAQ:  ) is no exception, with GILD shares having gained only 3% YTD under choppy conditions.But in the long run, I don't expect this pressured situation to continue. Recently, Gilead announced positive results from a late-stage clinical trial of a  . Additionally, management is looking forward to developing iterations of its HIV drug, Biktarvy. GILD could develop an injectable version of Biktarvy for patients who are resistant to the drug.If nothing else, GILD belongs on your list of stocks to buy thanks to its cash position. Even under a challenging environment, Gilead managed nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow last year. The company is more than stable enough to continue supporting its dividend yield, which currently stands at 3.1%.As Canada's  ,  (NYSE:  ) essentially has a moat. In this day and age, no one can survive without internet access. As such, BCE leverages extensive broadband and wireless networks that have a value north of $4 billion. The company's broadband footprint extends out to 9.2 million locations, and it offers LTE wireless coverage for almost every Canadian.Unfortunately, these impressive stats hasn't translated into market success. So far this year, BCE shares are down nearly 12%. But if you're looking for a contrarian play with strong cash flows, BCE is one of the best stocks to invest in.For starters, shares have relatively stabilized since late April, suggesting the worst of the volatility is over. Second, BCE's revenues have steadily increased over the past three years, and we're on pace for a fourth. Finally, BCE offers a generous 5.8% dividend yield, which the company can support.Last year, the telecom firm had $5.8 billion in operating cash flow, and $2.6 billion FCF. Unless Canadians suddenly stop using the internet, you can trust BCE.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The 8 Best Cash Cow Stocks to Buy for Stable Returns@2018-09-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-8-best-cash-cow-stocks-to-buy-for-stable-returns-2018-09-20
 is expected to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Sep 25.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 166.7%.In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 4 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent. The figure also improved from the in line results reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues were $35.8 million, up 35% from the year-ago quarter. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings shows an increase of 100% year over year to 2 cents per share for the to-be reported quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $44.2 million, up 29% year over year.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.USA Technologies is one of the chief payment technology service providers of cashless and mobile transactions in the retail markets. The company had effectively acquired Cantaloupe Systems, a provider of cloud and mobile solutions, for roughly $85 million.The buyout is aimed at expanding USA Technologies' product offering as well as customer reach. Notably, with Cantaloupe's existing customer-base in the United States, Canada, Australia, and South America, USA Technologies is likely to expand its footprint globally. We believe that further acquisitions will add to the company's growth.USA Technologies had also announced a strategic alliance with Ingenico that will help the company to expand presence in North America and market share in unattended retail market worldwide.International markets provide both growth and diversification benefits to USA Technologies. Major part of the company's revenue is generated from international regions such as the United States and Canadian market. These markets have the potential to generate growth over the coming years, led by a shift toward card usage and higher consumer spending. Strategic alliances with the governments, banks and corporations in these regions bode well for expansion into e-commerce in the emerging e-money sector.Further, the company successful cross-selling wins is aiding it reach new customers, gain competitive advantage and expand its existing customer base. With a diverse self-service portfolio and associated benefits (cost and time savings), we believe that USA Technologies is poised for solid growth.We believe all these factors will positively impact the company's to-be-reported results.However, USA Technologies is seeing some increased operating costs related to higher revenues, particularly related to some of its services such as loyalty and patents. This along with stiff competition and pricing pressure add to the woes. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Paychex (PAYX) reports results for the quarter ended August 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.8%.Revenues are expected to be $849.76 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.26% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Paychex, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.90%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Paychex will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of $0.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.61, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paychex appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

etting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Paychex (PAYX) is headquartered in Rochester, and is in the Business Services sector. The stock has seen a price change of 9.03% since the start of the year. The payroll processor and human-resources services provider is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.56 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.02%. This compares to the Outsourcing industry's yield of 0.98% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.8%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $2.24 is up 8.7% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Paychex has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.80%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Paychex's payout ratio is 91%, which means it paid out 91% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.PAYX is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.84 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.37%.Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that PAYX is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

CTS look strong on the back of the recently launched Open FactSet Marketplace platform, which offers both core financial and alternative data sets. The company's wealth management business is performing well with workstation deployments across top-tier clients. | In third-quarter fiscal 2018, total revenues rose 8.9% from the year-ago quarter to $339.9 million.The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), which reduced corporate tax rates significantly, should benefit FactSet's earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $2.22, indicating year-over-year growth of 16.8%.In the fiscal third quarter, adjusted earnings rose 17.8% from the year-ago quarter to $2.18 per share.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

nvestors interested in stocks from the Outsourcing sector have probably already heard of Convergys (CVG) and Paychex (PAYX). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Convergys and Paychex are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that CVG has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CVG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.55, while PAYX has a forward P/E of 25.74. We also note that CVG has a PEG ratio of 1.94. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.14.Another notable valuation metric for CVG is its P/B ratio of 1.66. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PAYX has a P/B of 12.97.These metrics, and several others, help CVG earn a Value grade of A, while PAYX has been given a Value grade of D.CVG sticks out from PAYX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that CVG is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about  , a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10.3% and a  of A.In a year's time, the stock has gained 23.9%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 15.6% rally.We believe Accenture has the potential to exceed expectations, moving ahead. This optimism surrounding the stock is backed by the company's strong cloud and digital marketing capacities, courtesy of acquisitions and partnerships.The latest forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner raised optimism about Accenture's near-term performance. According to the research firm, worldwide IT spending will reach $3.7 trillion in 2018, representing a 6.2% increase from the last year. According to John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner, ""Although global IT spending is forecast to grow 6.2 percent this year, the declining U.S. dollar has caused currency tailwinds, which are the main reason for this strong growth."" This encourages us about the company's near-term prospects. | Accenture's strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships is a step in the right direction. This is evident from the recent forecast by several independent research firms. According to a research firm, Gartner, the worldwide public cloud revenues are likely to grow 21.4% in 2018 to $186.4 billion, up from $153.5 billion in 2017.International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasted spending on public cloud services and infrastructure to witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% during the 2016-2021 period. Therefore, considering the increasing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Accenture's investments in this space to propel long-term growth.Accenture has strengthened its digital marketing capabilities through some significant acquisitions, including HO Communication, Reactive Media, Acquity Group Ltd., dgroup and OCTO Technology. It should be noted that competent marketing is the key to success for every organization. Marketing and digital executives of a company are responsible for developing digital marketing campaigns, marketing contents, e-Commerce and marketing operations.Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher return on investment from it. Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect the company's investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth. This will also help Accenture in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as IBM, Dell and Deloitte.Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader  include Genpact  , Automatic Data Processing  and Paychex, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Genpact, Automatic Data Processing and Paychex is 10%, 11.3% and 8.2%, respectively.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

hares of  have gained a massive 70.8% over the past year, outperforming the 25% rally of the  it belongs to.The company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results missed the Zacks Consensus estimate on both counts. Adjusted earnings of $1.86 per share missed the consensus mark by 2 cents but came ahead of the year-ago figure by 15 cents. Total revenues of $1.32 billion lagged the consensus estimate by $6.6 million and fell short of the year-ago figure by $26 million.However, Broadridge has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 23.4%.Broadridge's business model helps it to generate a good percentage from recurring fee revenues, which include contributions from net new business, internal growth and acquisition-related synergies. Notably, revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 came in at $4.3 billion, $4.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 5%, 43% and 7.5%. The company's diversified products and services coupled with strategic acquisitions have boosted top-line growth. Higher revenues are expected to expand margins and increase profitability in the long run. | With increasing demand for technology solutions, Broadridge has ramped up investments in digital, AI, cloud and blockchain particularly via acquisitions. These investments are likely to enhance the value of the company's core product offerings and should prove beneficial in the long run. Globally, consistent demand for technology solutions should help Broadridge gain significantly from its SaaS based offerings. Growing trends like increasing demand for data and analytics, mutualization and digitization should boost sales.Broadridge has supplemented internal growth with strategic acquisitions. So far this year, the company completed acquisitions of FundAssist Limited, MackayWilliams LLP and ActivePath at aggregate prices of $47 million, $8 million and $25 million, respectively. It made three acquisitions in 2017 and six in 2016. We believe such buyouts are helping Broadridge to expand its product portfolio and customer reach, besides enabling it to evolve as a leading financial and outsourcing services provider.Broadridge carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company's adjusted gross margin expanded 110 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 84.1%, primarily due to a higher revenue base.As a percentage of revenues, total adjusted administration expenses and sales and marketing expenses of 47.9% and 23.4% declined 290 and 330 bps, respectively. Paycom Software's adjusted EBITDA increased 46.2% year over year to $53.5 million.Paycom Software exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $54.6 million compared with $68.1 million in the previous quarter.The company's balance sheet comprises long-term debt of $33.5 million compared with $35.3 million in the previous quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2018 was $100.4 million.

Analysts also adjusted their estimates higher for next year, projecting 23% top line growth and a nearly 22% EPS markup.Not only did this guidance compel analysts to raise their estimates and make PAYC a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy), but it compelled investors to buy all the shares they could in August, rallying the stock over 40%.Keep your eye on this young upstart in the big world of SaaSy employer services.Zacks Research has released a report that may shock many investors.

Xerox was sued by Fujifilm demanding more than $1 billion as punitive damages and a $183 million as merger termination fee.The deal, which was announced in January 2018, was called off by Xerox in May after activist investors - Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason - stated it undervalued the company. Among other things, the company also cited unresolved accounting issues with Fujifilm as a reason to end the merger.Xerox then made changes to the board of directors and replaced the then chief executive officer, Jeff Jacobson, with Icahn-backed John Visentin. | Advancements in IT have replaced the traditional means of sending and storing information by digital media.

"Chicago, IL -August 13, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include:  , L  ,  ,  and  . Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their 'first' profit and explains why they are ones to watch.Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the newest jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries:1) Professional & Business Services: +51,000(up 518,000 over the last 12 months)2) Manufacturing: +37,000(up 327,000 over the last 12 months)3) Health Care: +34,000(up 286,000 over the last 12 months)4) Food Services & Drinking Places: +26,000(up 203,000 over the last 12 months)5) Construction: +19,000(up 308,000 over the last 12 months)Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

hether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Headquartered in Rochester, Paychex (PAYX) is a Business Services stock that has seen a price change of 4.49% so far this year. The payroll processor and human-resources services provider is paying out a dividend of $0.56 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.15% compared to the Outsourcing industry's yield of 0.99% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.83%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.24 is up 8.7% from last year. In the past five-year period, Paychex has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.40%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Paychex's current payout ratio is 91%. This means it paid out 91% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, PAYX expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.84 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.37%.Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that PAYX is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

very week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries:1) Professional & Business Services: +51,000(up 518,000 over the last 12 months)2) Manufacturing: +37,000(up 327,000 over the last 12 months)3) Health Care: +34,000(up 286,000 over the last 12 months)4) Food Services & Drinking Places: +26,000(up 203,000 over the last 12 months)5) Construction: +19,000(up 308,000 over the last 12 months)Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 5 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report: Paychex(Professional & Business Services) Luxfer Holdings(Manufacturing) WellCare Health Plans(Health Care) Carrols Restaurant Group(Food Services & Drinking Places) Jacobs Engineering Group(Construction)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place. But instead of waiting for the next great stock to fall into your lap, you can actively search for them. And by reading a few extra reports and then putting those ideas into a capable screener, you'll soon be amazed at some of the new picks you come up with.And you'll feel pretty smart after finding them too.The Research Wizard is a great place to begin. It's easy to use. Everything is in plain language. And it's very intuitive. Start your trial to the Research Wizard today. And the next time you read an economic report, open up the Research Wizard, plug your finds in, and see what gems come out.Want more articles from this author?

"ate doing taxes? If so, you're not alone.Americans spend  preparing their taxes, which collectively adds up to around six billion hours every year. To put that number into perspective, it took 22 million man-hours to build Dubai's Burj-Khalifa, the largest building in the entire world. Number-crunching our taxes takes us 272 times longer each year than the construction of one of the greatest feats of modern history.Image source: Getty Images.Several businesses have attempted to address this huge pain point of time inefficiency.  (NASDAQ: INTU) built a $52 billion empire by automating tax-preparation accounting, offering TurboTax for consumers and Quickbooks for small businesses. The company has been firing on all cylinders,  a 45% increase in online Quickbooks subscribers.  (NASDAQ: ADP) has focused on larger enterprises, handling the payroll and HR bookkeeping needs of 700,000 global customers in 113 countries. ADP's strong results led it to  its full-year guidance and quarterly dividend.The magnitude of those numbers is nothing to sneeze at, but they're still just a drop in the bucket of the larger opportunity. The U.S. alone has 30 million small businesses, and software assistants can only help so much.We're already living in a world of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. What we really need is a fully-automated solution, which would allow us to be completely hands-off but also comfortable knowing that we're fully compliant and accurate.I recently spoke with Gusto CEO and co-founder Josh Reeves about a potential next-generation solution. Gusto's cloud-based, fully-automated platform is helping 60,000 small businesses  of payroll, benefits, and HR. And because the platform is cloud-based, it's able to be both fully integrated  affordable.In the following video, Reeves describes the impact that automation will have on the workforce, how vendors are differentiating from one another, and several of the new initiatives Gusto has recently launched.You may never think of payroll processing in the same way. A full transcript is provided below.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now… and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. Hi everyone. Motley Fool Explorer lead advisor Simon Erickson. I'm here at the CB Insights Future of Fintech event in New York City. I'm joined today by Josh Reeves. Josh is the co-founder and CEO of Gusto. Josh, thanks so much for joining me this afternoon. Great to be here! Now, you're an electrical engineer by training. What brought you into Gusto and tell me what this company does? So all three founders of Gusto were actually electrical engineering way back when. That was a long time ago. I would not hire myself as an engineer today. Fair enough. You know, we got into this space. What Gusto does, we serve over 60,000 businesses today with payroll, HR, and benefits, so an all-in-one solution to help these small businesses, many of which have been doing it manually for a long time. The way we got into the space was, we had all run our own prior small businesses. So that was one catalyst, we had all run our own small companies, had a lot of frustration with the existing tools out there, and then we also have family that run small businesses, so we had grown up with exposure to some of those same frustrations. As we did some research, we realized it wasn't just ourselves and our families. A ton of companies out there are actually doing things like payroll by hand, doing insurance in a very manual way, and there's a lot of pain that comes from that.Every year in the States, 40% of companies get fined for incorrectly doing their payroll taxes. That was a call to action for us: Let's go try to fix that. So that's the frustration a lot of these SMBs are feeling -- a lot of inefficiencies. It takes a lot of time, and you guys are automating a lot of these processes. Yeah, so we have, I'd say, three kind of big pillars to what we're trying to do. One is definitely what we call ""peace of mind"". So take all these manual processes, tax filings, tax payments, tax calculations, local/state/federal; we process tens of millions of dollars now through Gusto and do it in a way that's accurate, efficient, and scalable. A business owner does not need to do those things themselves by hand. We like to think that we are taking five of those 20 hats that business owner's been wearing off their head and saying, ""We'll work with you and do that for you."" That's a really positive impact. It saves you time, it saves you money, it gives you that peace of mind. So this is a hot topic right now. Automation has come up quite a bit at the conference that we're here at today. There's competitors who are also trying to do the same thing. How do you differentiate yourselves from others? Or maybe if I ask this a different way, what are the hardest things in your world to do? Yeah, Government hasn't made it easy. You know, like I said, we work with every tax agency, process every document, and so it took us time. We got to nationwide coverage three years ago, and that was three years into our company's history. We started six years ago. Then, the reality is it's a very fragmented market so you have companies out there like ADP and  (NASDAQ: PAYX) , very large businesses. They each serve about 10% of the companies in America.We now serve 1%, so we've made some good progress, but it really wasn't possible until recently to build a product like Gusto.It's a cloud-based product; it's fully integrated. What customers love about it is it's really, really easy to use. It doesn't require any training whatsoever. It's a more affordable price point. And then if you have any questions, you can call us, reach out to us, and we have an amazing service team that is super excited to help you. Now, as soon as those calls or chats end, we try to figure out how to prevent them from happening. But customers really love that simplicity, that ease of use, that affordability. That's been a big part of our breadth to-date. Is that what brought you to the SMB segment? Because I know the enterprise is also very interested in something like this, but why is it small business instead of the larger ones? Every part of the market has its own set of pain points, I would say. We're super excited and very focused on small business, because it's a massive segment. A third of the workforce is in companies with 1 to 100 employees -- 98% of the companies in America, the employers are in that segment, too. We saw a huge segment, but more importantly, we saw that's the segment with the most pain. That's the segment that hasn't had access to technology, has been doing it mostly by hand. So even with companies like ADP and Paychex, over half of these companies are still doing it by hand. Manual, paper rich, and getting fined and making mistakes. So we had some ideas of how to build a much better product, how to reach this segment in a much more efficient way. We wanted to start with the folks that were most in pain, because we wanted to help them. Josh, last question for you. You got a big announcement here at Future of Fintech. What's the news that you want to talk about? I alluded earlier to these pillars. Peace of mind is about the automation. We actually have a big phase we went through in the last couple years launching health insurance, and now we can help you set up health insurance, HSA/FSA if you're a small business owner.But the thing we are announcing today is really a big part of our third phase. That's something we call personal prosperity. The feature we're launching for the first time is what we call ""flexible pay"". It's something that we believe is the future of payroll. It's the ability for you to get paid when you want, for the work you've done. So this idea of a two-week pay schedule really should go away. It's created a lot of pain in the work. If someone has rent due two days before a payday, it leads them to have to take out credit card debt or a payday loan with a high interest rate. All of that would go away if you could get paid for the work you've done as you do it.With flexible pay from Gusto, literally you work three days, and if you want to pull out your earnings and get your pay tomorrow in your bank account? You can do that. Or if you want to change your pay schedule and get paid weekly, every Wednesday, you can do that. And there's no impact on the employer, so the employer's debit cycle does not change. Their cashflow stays the same. Gusto is actually making this all possible by advancing that capital to you. But the outcome is again, employees now get access to their money when they should have access to their money. Someone yesterday put it: This person's kids have a better payroll experience than he does, because when they go mow the lawn, they get paid. Right. But he has to wait 13 days to get paid. You're changing that. We're trying to change that, fix it, make it the standard. People should get paid for the work they've done when they do it. You shouldn't have to wait. Sounds like a good next wave. Josh, thanks very much for your time. My pleasure. And check out Gusto. Again, Josh Reeves, CEO and co-founder of Gusto. Thank you for your time and for tuning in.

We believe this business strategy will help the company earn profits and expand additional service offerings like hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management, communication services and secure information destruction.Moreover, government regulatory bodies require proper and immediate implementation of rules and regulations to protect the overall health environment. Notably, this is a major positive for Stericycle, which is focused on providing regulated business-to-business services. | Stericycle continues to grow backed by acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. In 2017 and 2016, the company completed 30 and 31 acquisitions, respectively. These buyouts contributed $570.1 million to 2016 revenues and $32.2 million to 2017 revenues.

uman resources solutions and payroll provider  (NASDAQ: PAYX) released fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 earnings on Wednesday before the markets opened. The company's report revealed that it made headway on both revenue and earnings over the last three months; we'll dive into the details after a review of headline numbers directly below.Data source: Paychex, Inc.The company's 9% top-line advance was paced by human resources revenue, which expanded 17% to $401.0 million during the fourth quarter.Payroll service revenue grew at a much more moderate clip, improving 3% to $452.4 million.Interest on funds held for clients of $17.7 million represented a 27% leap over the prior-year quarter. This was due to an average earned interest rate of 1.7% versus 1.3% last year, applied to funds held for clients of $4.2 billion. The interest Paychex earned is the equivalent of nearly 8% of total net income for the quarter.Paychex's total revenue growth was supported by two recent acquisitions. HR Outsourcing Holdings (HROI) is a professional employer organization (PEO) serving small and medium-sized businesses, which Paychex acquired in August 2017. HROI contributed eight percentage points of the 17% growth in Paychex's human resources business during the quarter.Paychex acquired Danish human resource and payroll software provider Lessor Group in March of this year. Management intends to extend its footprint in Europe via Lessor Group over the next 18 to 24 months. During the quarter, revenue from Lessor contributed one percentage point of the 3% growth in payroll services.Paychex achieved operating income of $320.3 million during the last three months, versus $300.5 million in the comparable prior-year quarter. However,  slipped roughly one percentage point, to 36.7%. According to management, the sales growth contribution from acquisitions was partly offset by higher expenses related to the acquired companies, an increase in PEO direct pass-through costs, and higher headcount as the company invested more in its sales and product development teams.In April, Paychex announced a 12% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.56 per share, which, at the current share price, returns a handsome annualized dividend yield of 3.2%. The company attributed its dividend increase to additional cash flow realized as a result of last year's U.S. corporate tax legislation. Management also noted that Paychex now pays out roughly 80% of net income to shareholders.The company repurchased $143.1 million of its shares during the quarter, primarily to offset dilution from stock compensation expense.Image source: Getty Images.While acquired revenue delivered a meaningful boost to Paychex's top line, the company has also demonstrated a knack for organic growth through product innovation in recent years. During management's  , CEO Martin Mucci discussed a new product for small and medium-sized businesses introduced this quarter, which is illustrative of the company's current strategy regarding payroll clients:This fee-based service is intriguing as it enables Paychex to further utilize its vast store of client funds and essentially enter the short-term lending business with its legions of smaller business clients. Perhaps more importantly, a service that can assist small business owners with the crucial task of making timely payroll payments, regardless of cash-flow timing issues, should prove a powerful retention tool for Paychex, which currently retains payroll clients at an annual rate of 81%. Each percentage point of improvement in retention equates to significant earnings and revenue potential.Alongside earnings, Paychex provided its outlook for the new fiscal 2019 year. The organization expects revenue growth of 6% to 7% inclusive of interest earned on held client funds. Operating margin is projected to hover around the current level of 37%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) is expected to increase 11%. Given fiscal 2018's adjusted diluted EPS reading of $2.56, Paychex is thus aiming for roughly $2.84 in earnings in the current 12-month period.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

utsourcing is the business of transferring the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company's internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by  , the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis. The buoyancy in the outsourcing space is further confirmed by its  in the top 37% (95 out of the 250 plus groups).Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stocks - Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.  and Paychex, Inc.  .

Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Broadridge clearly scores over Paychex in terms of price performance. Shares of Broadridge have gained 53% in a year's time, outperforming the  's rally of 24.8%. Paychex, despite rallying 20.9% in the same time frame, underperformed both Broadridge and the industry it belongs to.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.Paychex's current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 11.3% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge. For 2019, Paychex's earnings are expected to register 10.9% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge.Thus, Paychex has an edge over Broadridge in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge has performed better than Paychex, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 23.6%. Paychex delivered a positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 1.2%.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 27.6%, Paychex not only compares favorably with the industry's figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge's 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.The Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and Paychex is 28.5 and 27.9, respectively, while that of the industry is 27.5. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Paychex has an edge with a lower P/E ratio.Our comparative analysis shows that Broadridge scores over Paychex in terms of price performance and earnings surprise history. Paychex, however, has an edge in terms of expected earnings growth and net margin. Although both companies carry a Zacks Rank #2, Broadridge, with a better style score, has a higher probability of success in the near term. However, a faster share price rally in the past year has led to a relatively rich valuation for Broadridge compared to Paychex.Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation  and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.  . While Automatic Data Processing and Dun & Bradstreet sport a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR carries a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Automatic Data Processing, Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and FLEETCOR Technologies is 11.3%, 6% and 16.5%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

" reported decent fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassed the same.Adjusted earnings per share came in at 61 cents, which increased 17% on a year-over-year basis. The bottom-line figure benefited from the tax reform policy. Notably, Paychex enjoyed a lower income tax rate of 28.7% in the reported quarter compared with 35% in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $871.1 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $3.5 million and improved 9% year over year. Revenues at Payroll service and Human Resource Services (HRS) increased in the quarter. Interest on Funds Held for Clients surged as well.In a year's time, shares of Paychex have gained 17.8%, outperforming the 12.1% rally of the S&P 500.Let's delve deeper in to the numbers.Payroll service revenues totaled $452.4 million, up 3% year over year. The improvement was driven by growth in revenue per check resulting from price increases, net of discounts.Human Resource Services (HRS) revenues climbed 17% year over year to $401 million, mainly owing to a rise in client bases across the company's human capital management (HCM) services that includes comprehensive HR outsourcing services, comprising HROI, time and attendance, retirement services and insurance services.Paychex's largest HRS revenue stream - Paychex HR Services - includes the company's professional employer organization (PEO) and administrative services organization. Increased demand for these services led to double-digit growth in the number of client worksite employees on a year-over-year basis.Retirement services revenues benefited from rise in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participants' funds as well as the number of plans served. Insurance services revenues also increased, courtesy of growth in the number of health and benefit applicants, and higher average premiums for workers' compensation insurance services.Furthermore, interest on fund held by clients improved 27% year over to $17.7 million on the back of higher average interest rates earned. | Paychex's total expenses rose 11% from the year-ago quarter to $553.3 million on the account of continued growth in PEO business, increased compensation and one-time bonus to non-management employees. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 90 basis points (bps) to 62.6%.Adjusted operating income was up 6% year over year to $317.8 million. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 90 bps to 36.5%, chiefly due to increased total expenses as a percentage of revenues.Paychex exited fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $424.2 million compared with $421.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. The company has no long-term debt. For fiscal 2018, it generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion.Paychex repurchased 2.5 million shares for $143.1 million and paid dividend of $739.7 million during fiscal 2018.Total revenues are expected to grow in the range of 6-7%. Payroll Services' revenues are anticipated to be within in the 2-3% band. Human Resource Services revenues are projected to grow in the 10-11% range. Interest on funds held for clients is envisioned to grow in the band of 15-20%.Operating margin is anticipated to be roughly 37%. Adjusted net income is likely to increase in the range of 11-12%. Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to be up approximately 11%. Effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 24%.Paychexcurrently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader  include The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation  , NV5 Global, Inc.  and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc.  . While Dun & Bradstreet sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NV5 Global and FLEETCOR carry a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see  .The long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Dun & Bradstreet, NV5 Global, and FLEETCOR is 6%, 20% and 16.5%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

 has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 28.6%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 24.4% and a market cap of $6.33 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to retain in their portfolio if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Notably, the Paycom stock has gained 25% in the year so far, outperforming the  's rally of 18.7%.Let's take a look at the factors aiding the company's performance.Paycom is a provider of cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software as a service solution for integrated software for employee records and talent management processes. The company offers analytics which manage the complete employment life cycle, right from recruitment to retirement.The company is gaining from its regular investments in SaaS technology. Over the last few years, clients migrating from traditional payroll service providers to the company's SaaS-based services have contributed significantly to its revenues. Notably, more and more organizations are becoming aware of the benefits of new age human resource technologies, which will continue to positively impact their financials.We believe accelerated adoption of Paycom's robust portfolio has aided the company's financials. In first-quarter 2018, the company's revenues came in at $153.9 million, reflecting a 29% year-over-year increase, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151 million.Furthermore, the company's client base has been growing, supported by its sales force. In the last reported quarter, management was particularly optimistic about the operations of the company's sales force, with senior sales people outperforming expectations. Pertaining to the stellar performance of the sales team, the company opened its 47th sales office in Rochester, NY, in the first quarter of 2018.Nevertheless, heightening competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation  , Intuit Inc.  and Paychex, Inc.  remains a headwind, which could lead to pricing pressure and affect Paycom's margins.Paycom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: PAYX)Q4 2018 June 27, 2018, Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we'll conduct the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press * followed by the number 1. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect from the conference. May I introduce our speaker for today, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Thank you for joining us for the discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. You can access our earnings release on our investors relations webpage, and our 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today's call, I will review the business highlights for the fourth quarter, Efrain will review our fourth quarter and full-year financial results, and discuss our guidance for Fiscal 2019. Then will open it up for your questions.We were pleased with our strong finish to Fiscal 2018 and the progress we made on key initiatives. Our total revenue growth was 9% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the fiscal year, including our acquisitions of HROI and the Lessor Group. As of May 31, 2018, we served over 650,000 payroll clients. We acquired HROI, a national PEO in August of 2017, and acquired the Lessor Group, a payroll and HR service provider headquartered in Denmark, at the end of February 2018. We are pleased with both of these acquisitions, which have so far exceeded our expectations and are progressing well, and we believe these acquisitions position us well for long-term growth in both our PEO and international businesses.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Paychex wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!At the start of Fiscal 2018, we implemented certain changes on our sales go-to-market strategy. We started off slowly in the first half of the year, but gained momentum in the second half. We are particularly pleased with the sales performance in our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, including our PEO business, which performed well in both sales and client retention. Excluding Lessor, our payroll client base was comparable to last year.Client retention was greater than 81% of our beginning fiscal year payroll client base at the end of last year. We had just completed a realignment of our service organization to allow greater flexibility and customization of the service our clients receive. During that transition, we experienced a slight reduction in retention. If Fiscal '18, client loss trends improved as the year progressed, and in particular, we showed strong retention in our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions for the year.Job growth among small businesses has moderated and the unemployment rate is the lowest we've seen in many years. These reflect the tightening labor markets. We are well positioned at Paychex to help business owners make positive changes to wages, benefits, in their challenging employee recruiting environment that will aid them in competing for top talent.Within the small business sector, entrepreneurship has also neared peak levels since the recession, which has helped create jobs and drive the economy. Overall, business owners have a positive outlook on small business economic environment and hiring. We are constantly evaluating strategic opportunities to bring value to our customers and help them grow their businesses, and this past month we launched several new innovative offerings that are being well received to start.First, we introduced Paychex Promise, which was its first-of-a-kind offering in the payroll and HR industry. Paychex Promise is a subscription-based service that delivers peace of mind to business owners through protection against payroll interruptions and solutions to address the routine challenges of running a successful business. The primary offering is payroll protection, which extends the collection period of payroll funds from a business' bank account by 7 days without interruption of service. This will allow business owners to pay their employees and remit taxes on time regardless of cash flow timing issues.This is particular helpful for small businesses that many times have cash flow timing challenges. The service also provides access to other tools to help businesses build their credit file, stay on top of regulatory changes, and resolve fraudulent events. We are pleased with the positive reaction to this service received so far in the market, with over 1,000 clients joining us so far.Second, we announced a partnership with Workplace by Facebook, to introduce a social collaboration tool to the company's HCM suite. This platform allows for a secure space for companies and their employees to connect, communicate, and collaborate in the digital age, fostering increased productivity and efficiency. The partnership with Workplace allows client employees to gain access to their Paychex Flex information without logging into Flex directly. We're bringing the information to them in their social collaboration space.We are committed to delivering best-in-class technology solutions for our clients and business partners. In April, we added new features to our financial advisor console to enhance the user experience, to manage their book of business with Paychex and, of course, earlier this year we announced AccountantHQ to help our accounting partners.We were honored to be named to the Forbes 2018 list of the World's 100 Most Innovative Companies, indicating that investors believe Paychex is among the firms most list likely to continue to develop the next big innovation. I'm very proud of our service organization for the receipt of a bronze medal for the Customer Service Department of the Year from the American Business Awards for the second consecutive year. This honor is part of the ABA's Stevie Awards, which are widely considered to be the world's top honors for sales and customer service.Paychex clients are empowered to choose the way in which they like to be serviced. Dedicated payroll specialists, dedicated relationship manager, 24 by 7 call center, social media options, or a self-service approach. This flexible service, these many options, along with responsiveness, reliability, and the knowledge of our service givers allows Paychex to back up our leading edge technology with world-class service.We were very excited to celebrate our 15 years of partnership with the AICPA CPA.com through the Paychex Partner Program. The Partner Program designates Paychex as the performed provider of payroll, HR, and retirement services, and offers special benefits to the clients of the program members. Paychex and CPA.com partner to enhance the CPA profession's role as an entrusted advisor to their clients and we provide unique value to CPAs in the program through the accountant-specific experience in the Paychex AccountantHQ and the dedicated accountant service model.Paychex is a significant beneficiary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as we talked about last quarter. As we discussed, we have already initiated our plans to use a portion of these benefits to accelerate investments in the business in the areas of sales and marketing, and product innovation. These investments continue into Fiscal '19 and will provide additional product offerings in next-generation platforms that will position us well for longer-term growth.The substantial portion of the tax savings, of course, is going to our shareholders. In April, we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 12%, to $0.56 per share. This increase was a fiscal quarter earlier than our typical dividend increase and was one way to share the savings directly with our shareholders. During Fiscal '18, we also paid out $740 million in dividends to our shareholders, which represents approximately 80% of our net income.We also continued to repurchase Paychex common stock to offset dilution, using about $143 million for that purpose in Fiscal '18. In summary, our fourth quarter closed out another successful year for Paychex. We are an essential partner to our clients, helping them succeed and grow their businesses through recruiting, engaging, and supporting their employees.Our innovative technology, full suite of HCM product offerings, and flexible service model is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth within our market ecosystem. Our organic business, combined with our new acquisitions, have positioned us well for Fiscal 2019 and beyond. I greatly appreciate the work of all of our employees and the management teams and their efforts every day for our clients and their colleagues. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain? -- Thanks, Marty. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements. Refer to the customer statements in that regard and our related risk factors. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements include certain discreet items and one-time charges. Please refer to the press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the fourth quarter full-year Fiscal 2018 to their related GAAP measures.We posed on our investor relations site our normal quarterly investor presentation. In addition, we're providing a supplemental presentation that outlines the impact to our financial statements of the new revenue recognition standard, ASC606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This is effective for us at the beginning of Fiscal 2019. The changes are modest and you'll see that, but they have an effect on the quarterly period, and so you'll need to look at that to understand what's going on.This presentation also reflects the impact of tax reform and other non-GAAP measures. My discussion on the fourth quarter and full-year results on this call will be under current revenue recognition standards. When I discuss our forward-looking guidance for Fiscal Year '19, I'll be providing guidance incorporating the impact of ASC606. Again, it's relatively modest, but it does impact the quarters and there's one tax item that you'll just need to look at when you look at that presentation. I'll be hosting a separate call at 11:00 to walk through the impact of ASC606 and other items for those who are interested in participating.I'll start by providing some of the key highlights for this quarter and then provide greater detail in certain areas. I'll touch briefly on full-year results and wrap with a review of the Fiscal '19 outlook. Revenue growth, as Marty mentioned, was 9% for the quarter, and grew to $871 million. This was aided by HROI and Lessor. As Marty said, they performed well.Expenses increased 11% for the fourth quarter. The acquisitions of HROI and Lessor together contributed approximately 7% total expense growth for the fourth quarter. Higher PEO direct insurance passthrough costs were a factor in expense growth, as well as higher head count due to accelerated investment in our sales and product teams.The effective income tax rate was 28.7% for the fourth quarter, compared to 35% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year in the effective tax rate was due to tax reform. This effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was lower than we anticipated, due to discreet tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter related to employee stock-based comp and an adjustment in the fourth quarter to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. So, you can look at that. It's in the press release and it's detailed.Net income increased 17% to $229 million for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income increased 13% to $219 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.63 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.61. We call out some of the items simply because some of them are very difficult to predict. I'll provide some additional color in selected areas.Payroll service revenue increased 3% in the fourth quarter to $453 million. The increase resulted from the Lessor acquisition, which contributed approximately 1% to growth, and an increase in revenue per-check, which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. HRS revenue increased 17% to $401 million for the fourth quarter, of which the acquisition of HROI contributed almost 8%. The remaining growth was driven by strong growth in client base across most major HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services.Strong demand with our Paychex HR services, which is reflected in continued double-digit growth in the number of client worksite employee service. PEO, in particular, reflected strong growth. As of May 31, 2018, PEO ending work site employees, and this excludes HROI, were 19% higher than at May 31, 2017, and were higher than our number at the end of February 28, 2018. I got a number of questions on that following the third quarter call. We had a very strong year in PEO and expect that momentum to continue.Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher average premiums within our Workers' Comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset-fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds. Let's talk about interest on funds held for clients. They increased 27% for the fourth quarter to $18 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rate earned.Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank-demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In the longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency securities.Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%. Average duration is now 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.7% for the fourth quarter, up from 1.3% last year, and we're beginning to realize the benefit of increasing interest rates. You just saw that the Fed recently raised interest rates again. Average balances for interest on funds held per client were down modestly for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by impacts of tax reform on client employee withholdings and the impact of average client-size mix, partly offset by wage inflation.I'll provide a few points on the results of the full-year Fiscal 2018, just so we keep the year-to-date in context. Revenue growth was 7%, payroll revenue up 2%, and HRS revenue was up 14% compared to Fiscal 2017. HROI contributed less than 6% to the growth in HRS revenue for the year. The impact of Lessor on payroll revenue growth for the full year was negligible.Operating income growth was 4% and adjusted operating income, which excludes a one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements, reflected growth of 6%. Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 14% and 15%, respectively, on a GAAP basis to $934 million and $2.58 per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were up 15% and 16%, respectively, to $920 million and $2.55 per share. This figure is comparable to what you'll see for 2018, when we restate for ASC606, but I'll talk a bit more about it. The quarter shifts a bit and you need to pay attention to that.Now, financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $720 million. As of May 31, 2018, funds held for clients were $4.7 billion, compared to $4.3 billion, as of May 31, 2017. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4 billion for the fiscal year.Our total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $38 million as of the end of the year, compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of the end of 2017 fiscal. Our longer-term portfolio has seen an increase in the end realized losses due to recent increases in market rates and interest. Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of May 31, 2018, reflecting $740 million in dividends paid and $143 million of shares were purchased during Fiscal 2018. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a stunning 46%.Our cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for the fiscal year, a significant increase of 33% over the prior year. This change was primarily the result of higher net income and timing impacts within working capital, largely related to income taxes and our PEO payroll and related unbilled receivables for payrolls not yet processed as of the reporting date. The prior year reflected larger outflows impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agencies.Fiscal 2019 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Payroll revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 2 to 3%, incorporating a full year of Lessor. Growth in payroll revenue for the first quarter will be below the full-year range. It'll be closer to approximately 1%, and the remaining quarters with be at or above the high end of the range. The gating is impacted by the composition of processing days within questions, particularly the first quarter. It normalizes as we go through the year. But we have some impact because of that composition in the year.HRS revenue growth is anticipated to increase in the range of 10% to 11% for the full-year. The HROI acquisition impacts the gating of growth for Fiscal 2019, with the growth for the first half being above the high end of the full-year range, while the second half is slightly below the low end of the range. If you'll remember, we acquired HROI at the end of first quarter, so we've got a little bit of incremental revenue from HROI in the first quarter.Interest on funds held for clients is expected to increase in the range of 15% to 20%. The guidance contemplates two additional rate increases in calendar year 2018, but no further increase. Let me just clarify; that means that at this point, we anticipate that we'll have two more raises in the year; in all likelihood in the fall and at the end of the year, based on what the Fed has said. We're incorporating that guidance nothing further than that.Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is anticipated to be approximately 37%. We anticipate that operating margins will be impacted by accelerated investment initiatives, as well as some impact from anticipated growth in PEO passthrough insurance costs. Effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. Investment income net is anticipated to be approximately $15 million.Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 11% to 12%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to increase approximately 11%. We anticipate that the growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first, second, and fourth quarters will be a bit higher than the annual anticipated growth rate and growth for the third quarter will be approximately 5%, as Q3 of Fiscal 2018 was impacted by the change in the corporate statutory rate. In order to understand this guidance, you need to refer to the ASC606 presentation that either is posted or will be posted shortly to the website. There is some shifting in quarters. We do a very comprehensive reconciliation from as-reported GAAP to what we are calling our adjusted number.As I previously mentioned, this guidance is presented reflecting the adoption of ASC606, which is effective for us in Fiscal 2019. Again, there is a schedule that's been posted to the website or will be posted shortly.We finalized our evaluation of the new standard and the most significant to Paychex will be the deferral of cost to obtain and cost to fulfill our contracts over the average life of clients. Currently, sales commissions and bonuses, as well as salaries related to client onboarding activities are primarily expensed when incurred. These costs will now be deferred and recognized over the average life of a client. The impact of this adds slightly more than $0.01 to adjusted diluted EPS for 2018, and we anticipate a similar result for Fiscal 2019. So, the impact one year to next is relatively small. It doesn't shift margins significantly, but it does have impacts on the quarters.There are minor changes to our revenue, which will be immaterial on an annual basis, as I said, but will impact the gating of the fiscal quarters. The changes from the new standard are all timing related and have no impact on the cash flows of the company. We'll implement the new standard using the full retrospective method, which will result in restatement of prior year's results and allow for more meaningful comparisons. By restating Fiscal 2018 under guidance, the result is overall growth rates for veterinarian, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share that are comparable to those anticipated prior to implementing the new standard. So, the growth rates will be pretty consistent.As I previously mentioned, we've included a presentation on the IR website to provide greater transparency on the impact of the new standard. It summarizes the impacts of the new standard and recasts financial statements from Fiscal 2017 and '18, as well as quarterly impacts for Fiscal 2018, including the impact of tax reform and other non-GAAP adjustments. You'll need to refer to that presentation to get next year right, especially the quarters.ASC606 also requires us to make additional disclosures in the footnotes to our financial statements concerning our revenue streams. As I had mentioned previously, our breakdown of revenues between payroll and HRS is becoming less meaningful, as we are selling more product bundles and payroll becomes an allocation out of those bundles. This trend resulted from our evolution to an integrated HCM provider. We believe that under new guidance, there's a more meaningful way to disclose the drivers of our revenues. Therefore, as we move into Fiscal 2019 and begin to provide new disclosures around revenue, we'll begin to align revenue guidance in the same manner starting in Q1. This will provide more disclosure, not less. You'll still see payroll and HRS.In the future, our revenue will be desegregated into two categories. One will consist of revenues associated with our integrated suite of HCM products. The second category which we'll break out will be PEO and insurance revenues. We'll continue, as I said, to provide supplemental information on payroll and HRS revenue during our transition. To align models, there won't be any change. We'll be talking about all of those details. We're not going to change your models in the short run. Between now and the end of our first quarter, we'll also provide on our investor relations website a schedule of historical revenue detailed under the new revenue disclosures, so that you can update models accordingly.I'll be holding a separate conference call at 11:00 for approximately one-half hour for those who wish to participate. I'll go through ASC606 and really talk about what 2018 looked like under that standard. Again, there's a shift in quarters and there's one tax item to discuss, but otherwise it's pretty similar, certainly, on the overall year basis. I'll take you through the presentation that's on the website on the impacts at that point of ASC606 and other items. Now, I'll turn it back to Marty. -- Great. Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we'll now open up the call to any questions.Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press * followed by the number 1 on your phone. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted. Your name is required to introduce your question. To cancel it, please press * followed by the number 2. One moment, please, for incoming questions.Our first question is coming from of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar on for David Togut. Thanks for taking my question. On your third quarter earnings call, you provided preliminary payroll revenue growth guidance at 3% and now it's been revised to 2% to 3%. What's changed in the business since then? -- Very little. I think when we looked at the composition of days, I just mentioned that, we saw that there was going to be an impact to revenue from one less day. It's in the range of about 25 to 30 basis points. When I looked at that and look at where the range was, I just thought it was better to be a little bit more conservative than we had been when we were in Q3. By the way, Rayna, I also said it was preliminary. I also provide other guidance on margins that change. So, we did some more refinement. This is where we ended up. -- Understood. That's helpful. Could you call out fourth quarter bookings growth and also discuss your expectations for FY19 bookings? -- I'll take that one. I think we don't give bookings growth in detail, but I would tell you that kind of what we saw in Fiscal '18 was that we had go-to-market strategy at the beginning of Fiscal '18 that shifted a number of, particularly the micro sales into an in-house virtual team or telephonic sales team. We miscalled that one a little bit as far as how long it would take to gear that up and some of the leads and so forth. So, we started off kind of the first half of the year lower than we had expected, but really gained some great momentum. And so we're feeling very good that through selling season in January and third quarter and then into fourth quarter, we actually ended up in the fourth quarter at the best quarter of the year for us from a performance year-over-year in selling and it gives us great momentum. We see that carrying into June right now.So, we really started on the low end of what we had expected, below what we expected, and then have come back with great momentum as the inside teams, in particular, have gotten used to handling the leads, gained tenure, and their productivity is up substantially form the first quarter of '18. -- Got it. Just one final question from me. For your 2019 service revenue guide, how much of a benefit are you incorporating for acquisitions from HROI and Lessor? -- There's a modest impact to payroll service revenue, about 1%, and Lessor is pretty minor, certainly less than 1%. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Thanks, appreciate you taking the question. I just wanted to clarify one of the things I think I heard in Marty's prepared remarks. I'm just trying to get an organic client growth at year end. I think I heard flattish year-over-year X Lessor. Is that right? I guess if so, I think that would be two straight years where we're pretty flat on that metric. Do we expect organic growth there in Fiscal '19? -- Yeah, we do. You're right, it's been pretty comparable. Without Lessor, it would be pretty comparable to last year. Again, I think while we saw some improvement in retention, which we saw drop last year, the previous year, '17, we saw an improvement in retention across the board as we settled onto the new model and so forth. In sales, we started out on the first half of the year, as I said, low and had to dig ourselves out of that. Through selling season and then into fourth quarter, it gained a lot of momentum.But we ended up about comparable on the client base without Lessor and so yes, you're right. We definitely expect gain this year. I think we've got great momentum going into June in the first quarter. Coming out of fourth quarter again, our best sales quarter of the year, which it isn't always, but this has been our best fourth quarter and we've really ramped up the inside sales team as back to meeting their productivity that we had expected at the beginning of the year. -- Okay. Understood. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the organic outlook for next year, just getting into the segment level. We were trying to parse that out a little bit. We were kind of landing maybe around 1.5% for core payroll and 8% to 9% on the HRS side. Are those ranges about right? I know you talked about it earlier in the context of total services revenue, but I wanted to break it apart so people have the models right. -- Yeah. If we're between 2% and 3%, and you pick the midpoint, then you're going to get about 1.5% on organic. Then I would say it's about a point, maybe a little bit less, little more, it depends on how you look at it on the HROI contribution. So, take that out and I think you're closer to 9% to 10%. -- Okay, all right. That's helpful. My last question, in the quarter itself, it looked like the operating margins actually came in like 50 bps above the high end of what you had guided to. Was that just timing of investments and some of those getting pushed to the right or were there some other factors that surprised you to the upside? -- I think it was primarily timing of investments, Jason. You make an estimate of where you think expenses will come in. It was a little bit lighter than we thought. -- I think one point on that, Efrain, as we talked about before at some of the conferences in the last quarter, I think we estimated, we were pretty conservative on the margins from the investments that we said we would make from tax reform. So, we kind of went a little bit on the lower end and we had brought that back a bit. So, you saw 37%, approximately 37%, and then you've also seen the guidance that Efrain's given on that going forward. So we feel like, as we've looked at it and tightened up the investments that we've already started to make from tax reform and accelerate those investments, that's where we're going to be. Which I think some interpreted to be a little lower than that; we don't see that happening. -- Okay. Appreciate the comments. -- Thank you.Our next question is coming from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Efrain, on the margin guidance, it seems like the 37% number you're guiding to now, a little bit better than the 36% you talked about preliminarily on the last conference calls. Can you maybe just give us a sense of are you finding some kind of extra core savings in the business elsewhere to offset some of the investments or are the investments a little bit less? How should we think about the outlook for margins now? And, I guess, more importantly, as you look forward from here, do you think you can return to akin to market expansion? -- Let me take the second. The answer so the second is that's our anticipation that starting next year, meaning '20, not '19, we begin with a cadence of margin expansion and how much to be decided as we go through the year. I would say, Jim, all of the projects that we contemplated in Q3 are still the ones that we're working on. I think the difference is we refined a bit what our estimates were for the spend on those projects and it came in a bit better than our initial estimate suggested. I think that's what it is. It doesn't mark a significant departure from what we were contemplating doing, just a little bit more pencil sharpening. -- Fair enough. Then, I guess, maybe Marty, you could maybe take this one. Just curious about the overall employment picture you're seeing in the SMB and down-market space. Clearly from a macro perspective, I think, as we've talked about several times before, those job ads have kind of been disappointing through the cycle and that segment of the market. So, I'm wondering if you're seeing anything in the market that gives you a little bit more hope that the SMB job growth just on an overall economic basis is going to be better and why? -- Jim, I think it's going to be steady. I think that the optimism that I see comes from -- if you look at the optimism indexes like at FIB and so forth, they're very strong. I mean, they continue at historical highs. So, people in small businesses saying, ""Hey, I'm looking to hire and my issue is I just can't find the right people for the positions."" So, we certainly continue to see that, whether it's low unemployment rate, and the wages aren't going up quite as fast as you'd expect either. Still hanging around 2.6% to 2.7% wage increase. But there is a lot of optimism there. People are looking to hire. There is job growth, it's just moderated and we're still getting job growth and we're still getting a lot of optimism. So, we're pretty optimistic on what we'll continue to see. It isn't going to be huge growth because we've come back from the recession slowly and that job growth is moderated, but there is still job growth. -- Very helpful. Thank you very much.Our next question is coming from Ashram Ramkhalawan of Citi. Your line is now open. -- Hi Marty, hi Efrain. I guess my question was going back to the idea of longer-term operating margin expansion. Could you size the level of investment you're making this year and future margin expansion? Is it as simple as that incremental opportunistic investment phases out or are there other factors that you can point to with regards to maybe pricing or other factors that you can point to that help margin expansion? -- Yeah, Ashram, I'd say what we said -- and this goes back to the beginning of the year -- we said that we'd invest between 33% and 50% of the benefit accruing from tax reform; that's what's contemplated in our numbers. Over time, that will phase down. There will be some probably incremental IT spending that will remain from those projects, but if we execute appropriately, that will be offset by savings in other areas of the business and also better revenue growth.So, I don't have a specific cadence that I'll give you because we need to walk through the year and look at the payoff on the projects, but we know exactly where we would take costs out if we don't think that the projects are generating the returns that we expect. We know how to leverage. That's not difficult for us. This is a year where we decided it was more appropriate, given the ability we had, to invest more heavily and see if it produced the kinds of returns that we anticipate it will. I would say early on, we feel comfortable that we're getting those returns. We'll walk through the year and then see how the projects progress. -- Yeah, we're following it very closely. As we've said, we really came out better, stronger on the operating margin that we originally thought this year and think that, as Efrain mentioned, we do know how to leverage, so we're watching closely to say, are we on track coming out of '19 for '20? What else do we need to do? We're constantly watching that. We are pleased that all of the investments that we're making are on track and we believe that, as Efrain said, will bring both revenue and growth, and expense reductions as well. They're across the board in both service and in product acceleration as well.We're pleased with the investments we've made. We think, frankly, we came out stronger this year than we originally had expected when we first looked at tax reform. Once we tightened up all the numbers and what we were investing in, we feel good they're the right things and we'll get back the margin expansion exactly. The timing is more difficult because of the investments and getting everything done, but we certainly feel that, as we have said, we'll be back on a margin expansion ride. -- Got it. So, it's safe to assume based on that statement that you're seeing early signs of sales productivity increases, retention improvements, things like that, which would be metrics that would can look forward to as you make these investments, right? -- Yes, but I wouldn't say the improvements in client retention and sales productivity and sales performance that we just mentioned are not necessarily, they're not driven by those investments because those investments just started, but we certainly feel positive about the investments we're making. We'd give you a better view of that six months from now, as we get a little further into the investments. But we feel like at this point they're certainly on track. We just started the accelerated investments in the last quarter. -- Excellent. Can I just ask, the strong growth in PEO -- what would you attribute that to? Is there some share gain in there that you're thinking about or higher demand for  ? Any color there? -- I think one very good sales execution, our integration with HROI and the team there with our excellent team, I think kind of really hit at a great point at the same time that there is just a huge demand for more HR support. When you think about the federal regulations, and I've mentioned this before, are coming down, there is a tremendous amount of state regulations that are going up. There is all the issues with immigration. The entire issue of harassment. Everything is driving more HR concerns and risks, particularly for small businesses that don't have the expertise. Small to mid-sized businesses and that's fitting very well into the PEO business when you tie that into our insurance experience as well. I think it's a very strong demand in that marketplace and a very good execution from our sales and service teams. -- Thanks. Happy fourth next week.Our next question is coming from -- Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I just wanted to understand a little bit about FY19. I think, Marty, you said that you would anticipate client growth coming back in FY19. But organic growth on the payroll side is going to be, I think around 1.5%, let's say. I'm wondering, are there some changes happening or do you think there will be less price? Just to better understand the client growth versus organic growth expectations for FY19. -- Yeah, probably a little bit less on the price. I think, as you see it, particularly on the small end, it continues to be very competitive. We're feeling very good about the product offerings that we have and introducing consistently innovating with do-it-yourself handbooks and paperless onboarding and now Paychex Promise. I think we're being a little more conservative on the fact that if we take a little less price, let's drive the client growth. Plus, we're probably being conservative for how much we can do on the retention as well. We saw some improvement this year. Things really quieted down on the service model, so we're getting more positive affirmation about 7 by 24 service and the dedicated, not only payroll specialists, but managers for the mid-size. I think it's just a bit of that. We've seen a mix change, so as Efrain as mentioned many times on the call over the last couple years, we've seen a little bit of a mix of size of clients. So, when you put all that together, I think that's our overall guidance. -- Efrain, just your thoughts on use of cash. Obviously, balance sheet just is flush with cash. You should generate a ton of cash again in FY19. Is the thought that you want to wait for the right opportunity maybe the acquisitions you're looking at, the prices change, or is it that there just aren't acquisitions that would fit what you're trying to accomplish? -- No, no, no. Absolutely not. That's an interesting question, Kartik. I'd point to Lessor. Lessor, we were in discussions for multiple years on that asset and eventually pulled the trigger and bought it. Advanced Partners -- we were in discussions for multiple years on that asset and then bought it. The fact that we didn't pull the trigger -- and I'd say probably to some extent even HROI we could say that. The fact that we don't pull the trigger in a given year doesn't mean we're not in relatively advanced stages on discussions on assets that we think make sense within our portfolio.I can say that we have acquisition targets that would use that cash plus very quickly if we thought that it made sense to do it. I would say the pipeline is very flush with opportunities and I would anticipate over the next year that we'll have an opportunity to do other acquisitions if we think that the due diligence makes sense. By the way, implicit in that statement is the fact that they already meet some level of strategic fit based on our screening criteria. So no, it's just really for us the timing has to be right. The numbers have to be right. Sometimes we are very deliberate in our approach to doing it, but I think there's a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities out there. -- Makes sense, Efrain. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. -- You're welcome.Our next question is coming from Brian Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guy. I just want to ask about competition. How do you think competition has impacted your financials? I think last quarter you talked about the mid-market being a little more competitive and now a little bit on the small end on pricing. But I'm just trying to figure out in the big picture, given the years of experience you guys have, how do you feel the competition is having an impact? -- Yeah, Brian. I would say it's been about, it's about the same. I think as I mentioned, the small probably putting a little more pressure on price on the small end. But not significantly too much different than what we've seen. Then on the mid-market, I'd say it's about the same. There's no really new players there. I would say that some of the innovations that we've made and some of the changes that we're doing right now in our sales model that we've started in the fourth quarter that will roll into the first quarter here on the mid-market are helping us position well. So, we're pretty nimble about changing how we're going at it.I think we've found some things that we could be doing a little bit better in the mid-market. But product-wise, we have the most thorough and complete integrated product out there. It's not just payroll and HR. It is integrated on a single employee record. But we're connected single way to 401(k) to HR. We have the largest HR generalist team out there, nearly 500 of them. All of everything positions us well from the competition. I don't think most competitors have anything that's as complete as that. I think it's about the same and we should be doing better. -- Okay. Then, you talked a little bit about future operating margin expansion. What about on the revenue side? What does the future long-term revenue growth look like? Does it look pretty similar to this full-year guidance? -- Brian, I would say we'd like to see payroll service revenue higher than it is currently. We're working very hard to make that happen. On the HRS side, certainly double digits is where we expect to be. While I recognize that there's a lot of emphasis on payroll and rightly so, and it's competitive, PEO is doing very well and we're very bullish on how that business is doing. We see a long trajectory of growth on that business. I would say, and you can do the math, we had almost 20% work-site employee growth organic. That's excluding HROI. I would say that probably ranks pretty high in terms of where we stand in the industry.We think we've got some momentum there. So, we feel pretty good about double-digit and I think that we're working hard to get the payroll. We'll talk more about HCM, integrated HCM rather than just payroll. Because I think that, as Marty said, that integrated suite is what we sell, not just payroll, which frequently is just an allocation from that bundle. But we can do better and that's our expectation. -- I think that mid-to-high single digits is what we've been talking about for at least 8 years. I think if you look at the overall kegger all together, it's over 7 and we're trying to make sure that's solidly over that number over time. We have a lot of opportunity to do that. As Efrain said, it's becoming much more of an HR play, which is what we had expected and planned that our business would go. That's why, as he talks about the future of how to report, it really is so much more about not just payroll by itself, but always payroll and HR, or payroll, HR, and 401(k), etc. We're trying to -- 6 to 7 is the guidance now. We're obviously trying to get that a little bit higher longer term to be in that mid-to-high single digits. -- Okay, helpful. Thanks for the comments.Our next question is coming from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. -- Hi, Rick. -- Hi, how are you? -- Good. -- The first one, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the composition of the float income outlook and what you're expecting with balance growth, especially with what it did this quarter? -- The Fed just raised rates a little while ago and we've got two rates baked in the remainder of the calendar year, one in the fall and one at the end of the year. That's what the guidance contemplates. We looked at the probability of a raise and when it got pretty higher for the second raise, we included that in our guidance. So, that's what we're expecting at this point; nothing beyond that. Although, there is a chance obviously that rates could continue to rise after the end of this calendar year. -- For the balance growth, it seems like tax reform and some of the withholdings impacted this quarter. Does that continue throughout most of next year? -- I'd say, if anything, it'll be flat to modestly up, that's where I think we're going to be. -- Okay, thank you. You mentioned several times about how pleased you have been with the acquisitions, especially with HROI and what seem like is going on the PEO business. So, I'm wondering if you could just sort of talk a little bit more about what explicitly you've seen from HROI, whether this has changed your appetite particularly in PEO for acquisitions and then just more broadly on the PEO market? Thank you. -- Sure. I think what we've seen is really a great fit from a culture standpoint and the synergies that we could get from our underwriting team with them. Also, they have connections that we didn't have. From a carrier standpoint, when you put us together, the synergies from the insurance carriers is very important and we see future opportunities with that as well. You have to have great plans, obviously, to grow in cities where we haven't been historically.We're pretty bullish on the PEO marketing. Again, we were kind of one of the first in this business when you go back from an ASO perspective, where there was not co-employment. We're the -- I believe only one out there that when you take all those ASO and PEO products, we're servicing well over a million worksite employees. As Efrain said, we've seen very solid double-digit growth again this year. Those needs are just becoming more and more difficult and small to mid-sized businesses are really struggling with state-by-state regulations with the harassment policies that they need to have in place to protect them. There's a lot of risk for them. When they hear risk, they're ready to outsource. When you go in with a great insurance product as well, they can add value to their employees, which helps with the retention and engagement. It really is a great overall picture for us in the future. So, I think the market is very strong. Acquisition-wise, we're constantly looking at that space. I think we know it very well. As Efrain said, we're always looking and ready to buy if the time is right and the value is right. -- Thanks. Just one follow-up, just confirming on the dividend, the change in the timing. Is that just a one-year thing and as we look forward to next year it should go back to sort of normal timing? -- That's kind of a Board decision, Rick. So we accelerated one quarter, brought it forward. Marty and I don't have a clear answer on that one, but I think you probably could anticipate we'll go back to the normal cadence. The Board will ultimately decide that one. -- Thank you very much.Our next question is coming from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Good morning. I'm wondering if I can just follow-up on a couple questions that have been asked already. One relates to the investments that you're making. I know that both of you have referenced some of things that you are doing. I was hoping you give a little more detail behind some of the major initiatives and maybe help us understand those that you expect to favorably impact your revenue growth, and then those that you expect to favorably affect your longer-term leverage in the model? -- David, it's Marty. I can give you a couple. I think this is what you're looking for from the accelerated investments. One is the HR space and what you find is how do you drive more flexibility for clients in our combined payroll and HR model? So, whether that's from user interface flexibility, whether it's allowing them to do a lot more things that they want to do and then build the product out the way they want it. So, from a user interface they want things a certain way. You can have all the product functionality behind it, but you can isolate by designing some of the software more from a UX and UI perspective and we're spending a lot of time on that.There is additional feature functionality. I wouldn't want to get too detailed into that from a competitive standpoint, but I think we have a very full-featured HR and payroll solution that also integrates with insurance and 401(k), but we're finding that the clients always want more flexibility from that standpoint. They also want more self-service. So, you'll see -- and this helps on both a service operations cost perspective and a sales perspective, more and more clients want their employees to do more themselves and the employees want to do more themselves.As you know a lot of the generation these days don't want to talk to anyone, but they certainly want to be able to chat. They want to be able to going in question, hey, can I change my address? Can I change this? Can I change my deductions? Can I look at this information? So, we already have 25 different things that clients' employees can do themselves, but we're trying to expand that list, which also takes pressure off of the operations and service teams to not answer the same old stuff, but to be more available for more detailed questions and more responsive to those.So, in general, that's where some of these technology investments are really going. One, it increases the efficiency and service performance to the clients and their employees. And the other also just responds from a product standpoint to something that I think we're going to be able to sell much more of. Everything we design we've gone to mobile first. Everything we design is mobile-first, meaning that what you see, you're going to be able to get to everything on your phone.We've made some significant investment in an Agile approach to development, in developing everything from mobile app, which by the way is rated very close to a 5 out of 5 these days and we're feeling very good about that. So, it's the whole way we've looked at the technology. The needs have accelerated and we thought this was a good opportunity to accelerate the development. -- So, a couple of others to build on that, David. So, the other two areas are in sales and marketing and operations. Sales is pretty simple; we're adding more salespeople, particularly in small business and mid-market. We're also adding more salespeople in the PEO space; more than we would. We typically would add 2% to 3% in a given year. We're accelerating the amount of sales add, salespeople adds there. We are also significantly increasing our digital marketing spend there to drive a better result.As Marty said, part of what we saw in Q4 was really good returns on that investment. We hadn't really started to heavy up the spending yet and we're optimistic about what that produces. So, that's the sales and marketing bucket. You can titrate that up and down depending on what the results you get are.Then, on operations side, there is work that we're doing from an efficiency of the footprint perspective. That is part of the spend in next year, and also looking at ability to automate some of those functions in the back end. So, we've got numerous projects that we think will produce both top line growth; Marty mentioned the platform opportunities that help both sales and back office, and then on the operations side, that's more of an efficiency play. So, all three of those are what we're working on. -- Good. Thanks for the color on all those items. Let me ask one different question, which relates back to the PEO. WSC growth I think you said was about 19% organically. I know HRS includes many different segments, but the category organically I think was growing around 8% to 9%. So, is the PEO organically really growing 19%? If not, is it growing more in line with the overall category 8% to 9%? Can help us understand why the unit growth is far exceeding the revenue growth? -- So, two pieces of that. So, make sure to disaggregate just a little bit. So when we say PEO, PEO is not HRS and PEO itself is not total worksite employees. As Marty mentioned, PEO is a subset of our worksite employees. I think we'll post when we post the K what our worksite employees served are. It's lower than 19% because ASO is in that number. So, it'll be solid double digits, but it won't be 19%.When we call out PEO, we're calling out specifically a portion of HRS revenue, not all of HRS revenue. If I isolate just the PEO portion of the business excluding HROI because HROI obviously contributes but if we exclude that, we're getting teens growth in PEO at this point and you're getting worksite employee growth of about 19%.So, you need to disaggregate some of the pieces of the business. So HRS growing at 17%, obviously you have to pull the pieces apart, organically more in Q4 like 9%, but within that you got a PEO piece of the business that's growing pretty rapidly and we think that continues. So, hopefully that clarifies a bit. -- So, just to quickly clarify that. Was the PEO worksite employee growth in the teens or it was 19%? -- 19%, and then revenue growth was in the teens. So PEO revenue growth was around 15%. -- Is there a dynamic that -- is that a mix, is that pricing, what? Can you help us understand why those are different? -- I think, David, it's really simple. It depends on the size of the clients you're signing up. So, smaller PEO worksite employees or smaller PEO client, you get more per client. Larger clients -- and we've signed a number of larger clients -- you get less per worksite employee. That's really the dynamic. It's interesting. When you step back and look at the business, think about PEO for a second. The backbone of the PEO platform is Flex within Paychex. That solution works really well in the PEO context. And we're doing very well there selling pretty large clients.When we look at the market, what we say is there seems to be a growing number of mid-market clients who want to comprehensive outsource solution and that trend is going to continue into the future. Now, as you go up market, you get a little bit less per worksite employee than you do when you go on lower market. -- Got it, great. All right. Thanks very much for that.Our next question is coming from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys, it's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Thanks for squeezing me in. I was curious to learn a little more about what you did to improve retention and hoping you could provide a bit more color or talk a little more about what's changed in your sales strategy that you kind of alluded to, at least for the upcoming sales season? Thanks. -- I think on service what happened is, as I mentioned last year in Fiscal '17, we went through quite a movement of client. So, we're increasing the number of online clients and we changed our service model on how to handle call-in clients versus multi-product clients and the normal payroll clients who are call-out clients. So, we were moving different service teams around and therefore moving the clients around. That caused some disruption that cost us probably a percent on the retention in 2017 and from an all-time high.So, as that settled out 2017 and we've kind of completed most of that, then we started to see the retention calm down. The tenure of our payroll specialists and our service givers across the board built up. Our tools got better when we got used to handling the different teams, and everything started to come together. So really, retention is improved and better in almost every category we have from payroll to 401(k), to insurance, you name it. We had a very good year in retention. We think that will continue as things continue to calm down and we get better tenure in those teams. So we had a nice improvement this year.Promoter scores, which we don't give out, but we saw an improvement there as well across the board in the satisfaction that our clients have. From a sales perspective, what we did was at the beginning of the year, we had a go-to-market that as I said, pulled some of the micro client, more and more clients as you know, are searching online, reviewing our products and platforms, testing the product, comparing the product, and a lot of the sale is 60% complete, particularly on the small end, before they even get to a sales rep.So, we were handling more of that inside and we were we built out a telesales team inside, expanded it, and we expanded it quickly at the beginning of the year. The tenure wasn't there. The leads weren't quite where we thought they were, and as we refined our lead process during the first half of the year and built tenure in the sales team, that built a very good momentum in the second half of the year and now positions us very well going into June and this fiscal year. So, that was the major change in sales. We have number of other things but those were the major ones. -- Okay, got it. Thank you. And any thoughts in terms of your client target mix and any thoughts on moving beyond the small micro-sized businesses and is that sort of factor in the sales strategy? -- Well, I mean, listen, our strategy is still really 1 to a 1000 and some above that, but that's our sweet spot and we have really, mostly the two sales teams that sell kind of up to 50, and then 50 to a 1000 or so, we would not be changing that strategy. But you're seeing on the SurePayroll side, they're growing very strong. The micro, we're refining how we handle each market and maybe even changing the segments a little bit about what is a micro and what is a little bit larger, and what's the over-50 kind of thing. But we're not changing the overall strategy. We're still very successful and with over 650,000 clients, we're not looking to necessarily change what we're doing or change the market we're going after, because we think we're very well-positioned to capture more of it. -- Got it, OK. Thanks so much.Our next question is coming from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Your line is now open. -- Hi, Mark.Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Wondering if you can give us a little more color in terms of how you think the PEO space is going to evolve over the next 3 to 5 years, particularly in small versus large, where you think the penetration is now and where do you think it's going to go? Because there has been a lot of emphasis on that. What the acquisition opportunities are like? And just how you're thinking about the space generally? And then I want to come back and just ask one margin question with regards to the guidance and just making sure we understand it on an apples-for-apples basis. -- Sure, Mark. I think on the PEO space, obviously we're very bullish on it. We've been in it a long time. We also like the ASO or PEO, and I think what we've learned to do is transition between -- we're one of the few that can transition between what the client wants. What we have found is probably an increased acceptance of PEO over the last year or so.So, as you have very good insurance plans in our markets that we're in, there is much more acceptance of the co-employment and the PEO kind of structure in those states, and from an insurance carrier perspective. I also think ACA pushed a lot of that and what stays and what goes of ACA almost doesn't matter at this point, but when it started, it got a lot more clients and prospects looking at insurance and whether to bundle that in and that feeling has stayed. With insurances, the other thing that I would say is helping the PEO and insurance side is the very low unemployment rate. The tough labor market makes it that more and more small businesses, small to mid-size businesses want and need to have insurance to recruit and engage their employees.You're seeing that while the wage increases have not gone up as much as we would think in a tight labor market, benefits have and that includes health insurance. So, I think the PEO market really, we think, could continue to grow for many years. It's really -- don't think of it so much as the co-employment as the ability to provide total HR support, including insurance needs from a very tight relationship and service model.So, we feel very good about it. That's why we're continuing to grow. From an acquisition standpoint, we know the opportunities that are out there. You've got to look at them very carefully. We think we've done that. If the right opportunity comes up, we'll be ready, I think we'll be very ready to go that way.Where do you think that penetration is, Marty? In terms of thinking about it more holistically in terms of both on the small a medium-sized business range in terms of what percentage of what you view is being the addressable market has been, has actually gone to a more holistic HR outsourcing including the insurance component? -- I think it's pretty small. And I think it's continuing, the acceptance as I mentioned, is continuing to grow. So, I think the opportunity is growing and the level that's been penetrated is pretty small. For years, a lot of it was selling PEO to PEO, so if somebody already had a PEO, you could sell them from a competitor or something on that. What we've started to see I'd say in the last year and half, again, I think ACA really pushed some of this forward, was more and more clients saying, I have to have insurance. It's also a recruitment and engagement tool for employees. So, I think that that's going to continue to grow.The acceptance of it, as that grows and other clients here that you have a PEO, OK I'm not as concerned about what co-employment means. By the way, the ASO side of our business is doing very well, as well. We have both those opportunities. Remember, with our Paychex insurance agency, which is the 21st largest in the country, if you're not a good risk for the PEO from an underwriting standpoint, we could transfer you over to the Paychex insurance agency and look for an opportunity for you there, and still serve you with an HR generalist, which is really the greatest benefit of the whole thing is having HR person who's there to support you.We've expanded that service model. For example, if you look at the Workplace by Facebook, one of the great benefits is not just that in Workplace you can gain information on your check stub and your 401(k) balance, but you can ask questions to the HRG while you're in Workplace by Facebook. So we're trying to expand that service model of the HR generalist as well.That's great. Then a related question would just be, there's more pass-throughs. I'm just trying to understand when we take a look in the presentation that you've posted, we're looking on the operating margin for FY '18 of 38.2%, the guidance is toward 37%. When we think about the year-over-year transition, how much of it is due to investments versus how much of it is due to mix, just because you've got more pass-through expenses coming through? -- The mix, Mark, is modest at this point. If PEO starts to accelerate significantly beyond where it is, it's going to start to affect more of a drag, but you're going to get better revenue growth. For next year it's more driven by the investments, there's a little bit of impact based on mix.Okay. Then just the cadence that was asked about earlier, should it go back to kind of the normal sort of leverage that we would typically end up seeing or is the mix going to impact that? -- Well, it depends on the growth rates for PEO, Mark. So, part of what we're talking about giving additional disclosures, we'll give you some insight into that. We think we still can leverage at least at current growth rates for the PEO. If that were to significantly increase from where it is now, then obviously that's going to impact margins but you're going to get better growth. So, it's a little bit of 6 of one and half a dozen of another.Can I sneak one more? Paychex's Promise? Are you taking much risk on in there? -- Well, we don't think so, because the client has to go through a review process. It's a very quick process, but we are reviewing what that risk is. But we feel that it's the kind of insurance for the client, particularly on the small side that have cash flow issues, that worry about that 2 days or 5 days or 7 days that they might have an issue, that we think this is something that given our size and financial strength that we can do, but we're doing it very carefully. -- We run it through a lot of credit algorithms, Mark, so we keep up pretty close eye on it.Great. Thank you very much for the color. -- Okay, Mark.Happy Fourth. -- Thank you.Our next question is coming from Tien Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I just wanted to ask given all the success and demand for comprehensive outsourcing and PEOs you've talked about a lot, is that stealing incrementally from traditional payroll or maybe even do-it-yourself? Just trying to understand how you might think about the secular theme there? -- I don't think so much from do-it-yourself. I think from mid-sized payroll, it definitely I think could be taking some share from there because that's where it's expanding for the most part. If you have 15 to 20 employees and up, it's attractive to you. So, it certainly could be taking from payroll only, but again, we're here to offer whatever the client needs on a full-suite basis. If you want full PEO, that's fine. That is certainly growing faster than the mid-sized payroll only or payroll plus just HR. -- Understood. So, from a resourcing standpoint including inorganic investments, would your risk appetite then go up maybe on the PEO side or maybe just to be little bit more aggressive on the distribution? Just trying to understand how you are balancing the risk versus the growth. -- You mean from an acquisition kind of standpoint? -- From an acquisition standpoint or even organically, if you want to expand what you've done in Florida? -- Sure. We've really already expanded. I mean, we sell pretty much nationwide, obviously the largest concentration is in those states where it's most popular: Florida, Texas, Georgia. But HROI has assisted in that well, as we have gone even more national. When you look at acquisitions and you look at investment, you do try to get some sort of scale in certain areas so that you can have better insurance carrier relationships and plans as well. -- Tien Tsin, you asked two questions related to risk. One Marty answered with respect to both the appetite for broader business development and the appetite for PEO. The answer is yes. The appetite with respect to underwriting though, we're really tight on that. My appetite for risk is pretty low in that sense. I think you can underwrite good business. We have very stringent controls on that and a lot of reviews on the state of both the MPP and the Workers' Comp portions of the portfolio. So, yes, it's a little bit more balanced kind of answer to the question. -- On the underwriting, we've always been extremely tight on that and feel like we're at a very good place on continuing to do that. Again, with that balance of risk, we always have the insurance agency and the ASO product to say if you're not a good fit there and we don't want to underwrite this, we do have an insurance agency with multiple other plans that can usually get you the insurance that you need. -- Understood. Just wanted to make sure. Thank you so much.Our last question is from James Fossett of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Thank you very much for the question and most of mine have been answered. I just wanted to ask, you mentioned that employment or pace of new employment has been slowing as the market tightens. I'm wondering what are the things that Paychex is doing or is adjusting to try to help its customers better attract employees? You've referenced that a couple of times, but I'm wondering if you can give some specific examples. And then, how well do you think those kinds of assistances can carry into when the market maybe isn't so tight? Thanks. -- Well, I think, yes, it's even more important now that it is tight, right? So, what we've been able to do is, we have over 500 HR generalists. So, if you buy our ASO or PEO product and you have an HR person, a lot of these small to mid-sized businesses do not have a full-time HR person. They don't know how to recruit necessarily. What we can do is help them with recruiting. We can help them on how to build the job description, how to recruit, how to on-board and retain and engage employees. That's where a lot of the benefit of that HR person comes from who has multiple clients by the way, and can use that data and that experience to help small and mid-sized businesses. The biggest issue for businesses today right now is finding and hiring, recruiting and hiring the right people for their jobs. That's where we actually, the HR person that we have can help them a great deal.Also from a product standpoint, when you think about it, being able to have an easy way to take prospect information. So, I want to go work for your small business. If you're with Paychex, you can go online and do that paperlessly. That transcends over into the business. They can review those resumes that are all online, all paperless. If you get hired, it's a paperless experience to bring you on.And then, of course, that transcends into a mobile app which you can show the new employee to say we're modern, we're with Paychex, you have a mobile app, you can get your pay, your pay stubs, change your 401(k), etc., etc. is all here. So, I think frankly it's been very appealing to businesses that are struggling to hire to use someone like us and our products and our services. -- That's clear. I guess it's really more of an emphasis on what Paychex can already deliver rather than you introducing any new capabilities. Does it make sense for you to look at adding additional or are there things that you can add to help in that recruitment employment process? -- Well, sure, I think there's always more things that we can do. What's the best way to recruit? How is that being done? Things like video interviewing, right? So, we can partner up with someone who can help a small business, who could never afford to do video interviews, which is very popular, becoming more and more popular now, right.So, I don't want you to necessarily come in. If I want to recruit, you do a short video, you send that with your resume, which is all paperless. We continue to look to evolve those HR support products to give you the best ability to recruit and hire and retain the very best employees. So, we're constantly looking at ways to do that and do it also in a digital way, much more through chat bots and artificial intelligence, and also give you data analytics, right? So, when you think about as a mid-sized client that has data analytics on what your turnover is, where your turnover is, how it compares to other businesses, those kinds of things are good tools that can help businesses that wouldn't normally have that available to them. -- That's great. Thank you very much.Speakers, we show no questions in queue at this time. -- At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying this webcast of this conference call, it'd be archived for approximately 30 days. I do thank you for your continued participation in our fourth quarter press release call and for your interest in investment in Paychex. Efrain? -- For those of you who want to talk about ASC606, we should have posted the presentation to the website. I'll hop on the call in about 5 minutes or so, and we'll walk through that in about half an hour or so. It will be a primer on all things ASC606. I look forward to having the conversation.

nvestors considering a purchase of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $69.27/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $57.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.20. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.8% return against the $57.50 commitment, or a 2.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to PAYX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $57.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Paychex Inc sees its shares fall 16.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $55.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.20 from $57.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $57.50 strike for the 2.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Paychex Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $69.27) to be 18%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.67M contracts, with call volume at 2.07M, for a put:call ratio of 0.81 so far for the day, which is unusually high compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, there are lots more put buyers out there in  so far today than would normally be seen, as compared to call buyers.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Agree To Buy Paychex At $57.50, Earn 3.8% Using Options@2018-06-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agree-buy-paychex-5750-earn-38-using-options-2018-06-19

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 5/8/18, Employers Holdings Inc (Symbol: EIG), LogMeIn Inc (Symbol: LOGM), and Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Employers Holdings Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.20 on 5/23/18, LogMeIn Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.30 on 5/25/18, and Paychex Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.56 on 5/24/18. As a percentage of EIG's recent stock price of $39.60, this dividend works out to approximately 0.51%, so look for shares of Employers Holdings Inc to trade 0.51% lower - all else being equal - when EIG shares open for trading on 5/8/18. Similarly, investors should look for LOGM to open 0.27% lower in price and for PAYX to open 0.91% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for EIG, LOGM, and PAYX, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.02% for Employers Holdings Inc, 1.07% for LogMeIn Inc, and 3.65% for Paychex Inc.In Friday trading, Employers Holdings Inc shares are currently off about 0.1%, LogMeIn Inc shares are down about 0.1%, and Paychex Inc shares are off about 0.6% on the day.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Ex-Dividend Reminder: Employers Holdings, LogMeIn and Paychex@2018-05-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-dividend-reminder-employers-holdings-logmein-and-paychex-2018-05-04
 has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 220.1%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 22% and a market cap of $3.03 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors need to retain in their portfolio if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let's take a look at the factors aiding the company's performance.Paylocity, a provider of cloud-based payroll and human capital management (HCM) software solutions, is gaining from its regular investments in SaaS technology.Over the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company's SaaS-based services contributed significantly to its revenues. Hence, regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovation, will continue to boost the company's top line.Notably, Paylocity stock has gained 30.2% in the last year, outperforming the  rally of 27.7%.We believe that accelerated adoption of the company's robust portfolio has aided the company's financials. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company's revenues came in at $113.4 million, reflecting an increase of 25.6% year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $111 million. | Apart from the organic enrichment of the portfolio, management is extremely optimistic about the acquisition of BeneFLEX. This new buyout has added a host of benefit administration related solutions and is expected to drive its revenues further.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from existing players like Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , Paychex, Inc.,  and Oracle Corporation  among others remains a major headwind. Increasing competition from new entrants also remains a threat. These are expected to generate pricing pressure and affect Paylocity's margins going ahead.Paylocity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

" (NASDAQ:  ) finds itself well positioned in its industry. As the second-largest payroll-processing company in the country, it stands to benefit from a growing job market. PAYX stock has steadily increased in price since 2009.Now as the economy is sustaining higher levels of employment and job growth, Paychex appears poised for double-digit profit growth. Given the profit growth and the investor benefits the company offers, Paychex stock stands as the equity of choice for payroll services industry investors.PAYX is the nation's second-largest payroll provider, serving over 600,000 payroll clients. Only its peer  (NASDAQ:  ) processes more payroll checks.Both also face competition from  (NASDAQ:  ), a human and financial capital management software provider. However, its software package, Workday HCM, primarily works with larger companies with more data-intensive needs. PAYX designed the competing Paychex Flex product for the needs of small and medium-sized businesses.Industry trends look favorable for business at all levels. The job market is seeing 2.7% wage growth, slightly below where it had been in the past. Paychex CEO Marty Mucci said in a  that the economy is in a ""steady state of business formation"" and that job growth remains ""steady and sustainable."" This positions PAYX profit levels to continue increasing.Paychex outperforms its larger archrival in every respect. PAYX stock has maintained a long track record of revenue and earnings growth rates that stand in the high single digits.Mr. Mucci believes profit growth could exceed 10% in future years.  back up this assertion. Contrast this with ADP which averages a little over 3% growth with revenue and about 4.5% per year in net income.Moreover, PAYX stock pays a higher dividend yield. The company announced that it will maintain its 50-cent-per-share dividend for the quarter. Paychex raised the quarterly dividend from 46 cents per share last July. At current prices, this takes the yield to 3.25%.The company has announced a dividend increase every July since 2014. Given this trend, investors will likely see another increase this coming July. While ADP has a longer track record of annual dividend increases, its dividend yield stands at just over 2.1%.Despite higher dividends and profit growth, PAYX stock trades at a lower price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Paychex's current PE stands at just over 24, compared with 29 for ADP.The forward PE looks even more compelling for PAYX. Expected profit growth brings PAYX's forward PE to about 21.8. WDAY stock, which tends to behave more like a tech equity, has no PE multiple since it currently operates at a loss. The estimated forward PE for WDAY stands at over 100 times earnings.The average forward PE in business services is about 22.5. This measure makes PAYX stock fractionally under fair value. While the stock would not be considered a ""bargain,"" it would be my choice if I wanted to invest in the payroll services industry. With job growth continuing and a large, increasing dividend, investors should enjoy a safe and sustainable level of profit in PAYX stock.A fair valuation, a high dividend, and continuing profit growth increases make PAYX stock the best in the payroll industry. ADP boasts a larger client base and also shares in the benefits of employment increases. Still, it sees lower rates of profit growth than PAYX.Paychex stock investors also enjoy the highest dividend yield in the payroll services industry. Despite the higher dividend returns, investors who take a position now will buy in at a lower PE than with ADP or WDAY.No stock bargains currently exist in the payroll industry. However, for those wanting to buy a payroll services equity now, PAYX stock stands as the clear choice.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Paychex, Inc.

For February, we could not have possibly seen a more ""Goldilocks"" scenario: 300K+ new jobs with only moderate wage increases, meaning the labor market continues to tighten without a noteworthy spike in wages, which would be a big contributor to overall economic inflation.On CNBC's Squawk Box this morning, Paychex  CEO Martin Mucci reported small businesses experienced a pullback in jobs for the month of March. Mucci pointed toward the tight labor market itself as the reason small businesses have had difficulty finding enough skilled workers to fill the jobs available, at least for firms with fewer than 50 employees. Phoenix remained the top city for wage growth, and Tennessee won the top state for small business growth overall. We shall see if this reported pullback makes it into the date we expect later this week.As expected, Tesla  reported its production and deliveries for last month, posting 8180 new Teslas delivered in March.

 , a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion's share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Cintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one million business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24.

Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3.

 is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Mar 27. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether or not this online financial data-related products and services provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, its results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate each time, with an average positive surprise of 1.2%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter is pegged at $2.05, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 13.3%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $334.8 million, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company is consistent with product innovation across segments with special emphasis on financial services to gain customers. Moreover, the company's acquisitions with the likes of BISAM Technologies and Interactive Data have enhanced its product suite and have helped expand its international footprint. It will also help FactSet to maximize value for partners and provide exclusive content set. All this will continue to aid the company in gaining new customers, thereby driving the fiscal second-quarter top-line performance.Furthermore, the company is one of the leading providers of online integrated data-related products and services for the investment community. According to technavio, the Global Business Information market is projected to witness CAGR of 5.2% from 2017 to 2021. FactSet, being one of the key data providers, is expected to capitalize this opportunity and increase share in new markets.However, the company has been suffering from a declining client-retention ratio. During the fiscal first quarter, the retention ratio came in at 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the previous quarter. It should be noted that a strong client retention ratio signifies more stable revenues. Therefore, although the company has been adding new clients every quarter, its failure to retain existing clients is a concern.Moreover, the company caters to a highly competitive industry. With prominent peers such as Bloomberg L.P., Dow Jones & Company Inc. and Thomson Reuters  , competition is likely to intensify. While FactSet has a technological advantage, some of these competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that FactSet is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  , and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .FactSet carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP, but an ESP of -0.16% makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these stocks have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Paychex, Inc.  , which has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see  .Netflix, Inc.  , which is another Zacks #3 Ranked player, with an Earnings ESP of +0.60%.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Thank you, and please continue to stand by.Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we'll conduct the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press * followed by the number 1. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect from the conference. Now, I'll turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may now begin. -- Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our chief financial officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2018. Our form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and form 10-Q on our investors relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review business highlights for the third quarter and Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our full-year guidance. Then we'll open it up to any questions. We were pleased with our results for the third quarter as we continued to deliver solid performance across our major HCM product lines. Our total revenue growth was 9%, aided by our acquisition of HROI.This is the highest revenue growth in our past six fiscal quarters. In addition to HROI, organic HR outsourcing services, retirement services, and insurance services all performed very well in the quarter. On March 1st, 2018, we announced the acquisition of Lessor Group, a market leading provider of payroll and HCM software solutions headquartered in Denmark and serving clients in northern Europe. We believe the combination of Lessor's payroll and HCM software products with our full-service business process outsourcing capabilities will provide a complete technology enabled services platform in the markets that they serve and will expand to. The Lessor group is a good strategic fit for the following reasons: First, the vast majority of its clients across four countries are in our target small business market. Lessor has a solid and scalable proprietary intellectual property with experienced technology development talent. They have a seasoned management team.They are responsible and reflect steady growth with the ability to fund further growth and development. We can leverage Lessor to support our growth in Germany, where we've been for the past ten years and provide an enhanced technology solution going forward there. And this acquisition offers us the opportunity to expand our market penetration in countries Lessor serves as well as other European countries in the future. We are pleased to welcome the employees of Lessor Group to the Paychex family. And while our international operations are currently small in relation to the company as a whole, we are excited by the opportunities this acquisition provides us for further expansion and growth. We have seen increased momentum in our sales execution as the year has progressed. In third quarter, sales to new businesses were up approximately 7% compared to last year's third quarter. During our third quarter selling season, in the small end of the market -- less than ten employees -- our sales teams have done very well.The midmarket -- up 20 plus to 500 or so -- has seen an increase in the competitive intensity. However, our comprehensive HR outsourcing services -- both PEO and ASO -- which we consider part of the midmarket, performed well in both sales and client retention. HROI, acquired in August, has been tracking ahead of our plan. Overall, despite a slow start to the year, we have exited our selling season with momentum.The labor market shows signs of tightening as evidenced by our Paychex IHS market small business employment watch. The growth in jobs is stabilizing because of challenges in finding qualified employees. And we expect this will result in business owners making positive changes to wages and benefits as they compete for top talent. We've seen a 12-month growth in hourly earnings of about 2.7%. The combination of this level of wage growth and consistent small business job growth are indicators of a healthy small business sector. We believe these promising indicators will continue to create opportunities for new sales in the small business market.On December 21st, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act or tax reform was enacted. And it's the most comprehensive tax reform legislation in more than two decades. Paychex, as a corporate tax payer is a significant beneficiary of tax reform. Efrain will discuss the financial impacts in more detail. However, I want to mention that as a result of the significant income tax reduction, we plan to utilize some of this opportunistic benefit to make various investments in our business. These investments include accelerating certain technology projects for the continued evolution of our customer experience, increasing our spend in marketing demand generation and sales and service strategy enhancements, as well as investment in our employees. These accelerated investments will help drive future returns for our shareholders. As it pertains to our clients, we are already helping them navigate the new tax code. Our systems were updated with the new tax rates within hours of their release.And we provide many resources to our clients from online educational content to our dedicated service center with experienced payroll specialists and on-site HR support. We are committed to delivering best in class technology solutions for our clients and business partners, and our HCM solutions have continued to gain acceptance as shown by recent recognition we have received. And I'd like to mention a few of those. We were recognized as a leader in the 2018 NelsonHall Evaluation and Assessment Tool, or NEAT, for payroll services for the second year in a row.We received this recognition for the overall depth of the payroll delivery capability and a robust user experience, which is enabled through our Paychex Flex cloud platform.

I'm very proud of what our 14,000 employees have accomplished with their hard work and effort every day for our clients. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? --  :Thanks, Marty. Good morning to all of you. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference will contain certain forward looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve risk. Please refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I will sometimes refer to non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share.These measurements include certain discreet items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release, and also refer to our investor slide presentation which breaks it all out for discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 to the related GAAP measures. I'm gonna cover a few things today. In addition to talking about the third quarter, I'll give some discussion about the fourth quarter full year and then a peak ahead into 2019. So, I'll highlight that as we go along. Let me start by providing the key highlights for the quarter. Total revenues we showed were 9% to $866 million. Approximately 3% of the growth is attributable to HROI.As Marty mentioned, they are performing ahead of where we expected at this stage. Expenses increased 17% for the third quarter. The growth rate was significantly impacted by a few items of note. These include the following: The acquisition of HROI. That contributed 5% to total expense growth for the third quarter. Very importantly, a one-time charge that we recorded following the termination of certain licensing agreements that we had. This contributed approximately 7% to total expense growth. Just please note that it's a one-time charge. We decided it was the right time to exit those licensing agreements. Our investment in employees by a one-time bonus to non-management employees during the third quarter contributed approximately 2% to total expense growth for the quarter. We didn't call that out as a one-time charge. Technically it is not. But we increased spending, obviously wanted to allow employees to share in the benefit of the tax reform benefit.So, total expense growth was also driven by higher head count in operations and sales as well as continued growth in our combined PEO business and investments in technology. The effective tax rate was 11.7% for the third quarter, compared to 34.2% for the prior year's third quarter. So, let me explain that a bit. The significant decline in the effective tax rate is due to tax reform. We're gonna walk you through the details of that shortly. Net income was up 29% to $260 million. And adjusted net income increased 14% to $228 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 29 percent. Again, for the third quarter. And adjusted diluted earnings per share of 15% to $0.63. Let me provide some additional color in selected areas. Payroll service revenue increased 2% for the third quarter to $455 million. The growth was driven by an increase in revenue per check, which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. HRS grew 17% to $393 million for the third quarter.It reflected strong growth in the client base across most major HCM services, as Marty mentioned, including comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services all performed well. Within Paychex HR services, we've continued to see strong demand, which along with the acquisition of HROI is reflected in strong growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Our Paychex PEO -- that doesn't include HROI -- has shown a surge of more than 20% in worksite employees from this time last year.Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants, applicants in higher average premiums within our worker's comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value participant funds. Interest on funds held for client grew 37% in the third quarter to $18 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned, a 1% increase in average investment balances, and excellent portfolio management.Now, I'll provide some color on the impacts of tax reform on our third quarter. The largest impact was reduction in the corporate statutory rate, which took us from 35% down to 21%. Paychex, as Marty mentioned is a significant beneficiary of this change in the tax rate. In addition to this overall change, we had several discreet items that reduced our effective tax rate to 11.7%. The first one is that we recorded a catchup in our effective tax rate for the first six months of the year during the third quarter. This had a benefit of $36 million or an approximate 12% reduction in our effective tax rate. The adjustment was necessary to conform our tax rate to the rate we expect will apply to our full year earnings. It's done in the third quarter. It got caught up. We also had a one time revaluation of our net preferred tax liabilities that was a benefit of to the quarter, reducing our effective tax rate by approximately 7%.Since we were in a net liability position on our deferred taxes, a reduction in the prospective tax rate yields a benefit because it reduces the amount of taxes we would expect to pay in the future. So, we had two adjustments there, one a catchup, and one the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. Again, it's all spelled out in the table. Should be pretty clear. As Marty previously mentioned, we intend to utilize some of this benefit, the tax reform benefit, to accelerate various investments in the business. These investments are in the following areas: technology for evolution of the customer experience and continued digital transformation within that business, increasing spend in sales and marketing to drive revenue growth, investments to drive operational excellence and efficiency, and finally, investment in our employees, part of which occurred this quarter. This accelerated investment will help drive future returns for shareholders.Let's talk about investments and income. Our goal in our portfolio is to protect principle and to optimize liquidity on the short-term side. Primary short term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and US government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9% and currently has an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.6% for the third quarter, which is up from 1.2% last year. We are realizing the benefit of a rising rate environment.Average balances for interest on funds for clients were up approximately 1% for the third quarter, primarily driven by yearend bonus payments, wage inflation, partly offset by some client size mix. Let's talk about year-to-date, just cover that briefly. Total revenue up 7%, of which about 2% was attributable to HRI. Payroll revenue up 1%. HRS revenue up 13% over the nine months of the prior year. Operating income growth was 3%, and adjusted operating income, which excludes the one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements reflected growth of 7%. Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 13% and 14% respectively on a GAAP basis to $705 million and $195 a share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were 16% and 17% respectively.Let me focus on our financial position next. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $827 million as of February 28, 2018. Funds held for clients as of February 28 were $3.9 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2017. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day to day basis and averaged $4.6 billion for the quarter. Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $35 million as of February 28, 2018, compared with unrealized gains of $23 million as of May 2017. Our longer term portfolio has seen an increase in the unrealized losses due to recent increases in market rates of interest.Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of February 26, 2018, reflecting $539 million in dividends paid, and $94 million worth of shares were purchased during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a superb 45%. Our cash flows from operations were $989 million for the first nine months. A significant increase of 29% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income and timing impacts within working capital, largely related to income taxes and our PEO payroll and related unbilled receivables for payrolls not yet processed as of the reporting date. So, now let's turn to guidance. We're updating it as you all saw. Payroll revenue now anticipated to grow approximately 2%. That includes contribution from the acquisition of lessor, which we will see in the fourth quarter. We haven't mentioned it because it, to this point, in terms of the results because it really had no impact in Q3.HRS revenue growth is expected to increase in the range of 13% to 14% for the full year, incorporating HROI. Interests on funds held for clients are now expected to increase in the range of 20% to 25%. That includes a very modest contribution from the fed rate rise last week. Total revenues expected to grow approximately 7%. Operating income margin is anticipated to be approximately 38%.That's down from our initial guidance, but the reason for that is that investment initiatives are now anticipated to impact margins for the full year by 150 to 175 basis points. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29%. Investment income net is anticipated to be approximately $8 million. Slightly lower than prior guidance due to the use of funds for the Lessor acquisition. Net income is expected to increase approximately 13%, and adjusted net income, non-GAAP, is expected to increase approximately 15%. Diluted earnings per share is anticipated to increase in the range of 13% to 14% and adjusted diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP, is expected to increase in the range of 15% to 16%.Now a few things that we typically and customarily do not provide, but we need to because of a number of changes that are occurring in this quarter and then going forward. Let me start by giving you some color on the fourth quarter. Our current expectations for the fourth quarter are first, payroll revenue growth of approximately 3%. That includes contribution from Lessor, which will be a little bit less than or around 1% of payroll revenue. HRS revenue growth in the range of 15% to 16%. Total revenue growth of 8% to 9% Operating income margins of 35.5% to 36%. Effective tax rate of 30% to 31%. I should say that I'll talk about the contribution of Lessor for the full year of fiscal '19 when I get there. As is our custom, we'll provide guidance on fiscal 2019 on our fourth quarter call, since we are currently in the midst of our annual operating plan process.But to give you some direction based on the trends we're experience, I'll provide the following comments: We anticipate that our for payroll revenue growth for fiscal 2019 will be comparable to the rate we experienced in the fourth quarter, which, as I just mentioned, is approximately 3%. And that includes the contribution from Lessor. And next year, we anticipate that the contribution from Lessor will be less than 1% of total revenue. We also anticipate that HRS will grow approximately 10% to 11%. This growth is comparable to the trend we experienced this quarter, excluding the incremental impact of HROI. We have not made any assumptions at this stage on the impact of further fed rate increases.We expect they will come, but don't know when and what the timing will be, so we'll update when we get to the fourth quarter. With a full year of tax reform in fiscal 2019, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% for fiscal 2019. Since we are taking the opportunity to use some of the tax reform benefit to accelerate investments in the business, we anticipate that operating margins next year will be approximately 36%. Finally, we anticipate that the acquisition of Lessor will be modestly diluted by about $0.02 in fiscal 2019.Let me just emphasize that these comments are preliminary. And I anticipate that some of you would ask this, and it's important to update, so you know the trajectory we're on. But they're subject to revision when we issue guidance during the fourth quarter. They're based on the trends we're observing in the business and could change based on actual fourth quarter results. I wanna comment also that we're completing our analysis on the impacts of the new revenue recognition standard, and we'll update you in fourth quarter. Please refer to our 10-Q for more information. We'll update you on all of these issues when we discuss final guidance at the end of the fourth quarter. And now with all of that, I'll turn it back over to Marty --  :Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we'll now open the call to questions.Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press * followed by the number 1. Please unmute your phone and record your name and company name slowly and clearly when prompted. Your name and company name is required to introduce your question. To withdraw your request, you may press * followed by the number 2. One moment please for the first question.Our first question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line's now open. :Thank you. Good morning --  :Good morning. :You called out 7% growth in new bookings for the quarter. So, two questions. No. 1, how does this compare versus your plan? And then second, since you don't regularly give out this metric, does this mean you'll start to disclose this going forward? --  :Not necessarily, but I thought I was trying to give some sense of the sales momentum coming out of the quarter. What the 7% was was the small business sales to new businesses. So, we had a nice growth in the payroll sales to new small businesses that were just starting up. And I think that tells a couple things. 1) That the number of new businesses continue to start up, and 2) That we're getting a bigger share of those new business start-ups than we were last third quarter. That was the difference. So, we're up 7% in sales to new businesses on the small end over third quarter of last year. :And how does that compare versus your plan for the year? --  :Well, we don't talk about our plan outside of the business, David, but we were pleased with it. It was definitely better than we had last year, and you could expect plan would have been very similar. So, it was a little stronger than we had anticipated from new business start-ups. :Understood. And then you mentioned growth in revenue per check. Could you put some numbers around that for the February quota? --  :February. Yeah. We don't disclose necessarily the number that we are measuring that against, David, but I think what we're saying is we're getting more price out of customers. That's the point that we're making there. :Got it. And quick final question. 20% client count growth at the PEO pre-acquisition. Can you just maybe flesh that out a little bit? Any specific reasons why the growth is that high? Do you expect that to be sustainable? --  :Well, we're very pleased with the performance of both the sales team and for our PEO organic -- as well as HROI. But this was organic PEO -- and the retention team. So, we had a very good retention. I think the way we've been pricing in the insurance changes, the benefit plans that we've been able to offer, and the very effective way that we've serviced clients and sold to new clients -- I think there's a growing demand for, as we've talked about on other calls, the PEO service. Particularly, with all the changes in healthcare and tax reform and all of these things, clients, especially in that midmarket, are looking for more of a PEO than they ever have in the past. So, we've picked up more clients, saved more clients, and we've seen growth in the clients that we have in the worksite employees. :Understood. Thank you very much. --  :Okay. --  :Thanks, David.Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merill Lynch. Your line is now open. --  :Hey, thanks guys. Good morning. How are you? --  :Good morning. Good. --  :So, Efrain, just a question on the fiscal '18 core payroll. I know you're obviously putting Lessor in there for Q4. So, I just wanna make sure we understand apples to apples because coming out of last quarter, I think we were talking about the lower end of the 1% to 2% guidance range. So, organically I guess, is that still where we are, or are you telling us that you feel a little bit better about where you'll fall in the 1% to 2% organic, putting Lessor on the side? --  :Yeah. I guess what I'm saying is I feel a little bit better today. And I'm in the mid-part of that range. --  :Okay. Perfect. Thanks for clarifying that. And so, now the key selling season is obviously past. So, just a couple of months left in the fiscal year. Any view you'd share in terms of where you see net client growth landing for the year on an organic basis? And as part of that, just any general observations coming out of key selling season. I mean, you talked about the new sales to newly formed businesses, but any specific color on retention, for example, would be great. --  :Retention, Jason, we felt good about. We're really near historic highs, and at least we're heading that way. We had a very good year in from a service and retention perspective in how we handled clients and how we retained our clients. And even as we rolled off discounts and so forth. They have discounts that roll off at times, and that went well. I would say on the sales side, I thought on the small end, we did well. As we said, we've got a bigger share of new sales to new businesses than we had last year. p about 7%. And in the midmarket, it's just very competitive. However, when you look at it from the payroll side only, it's very competitive now on both price and quality.But on the PEO side, as you've seen, we've done very well. So, you're seeing a shift more to that complete HR outsourcing. And we're feeling good about that. I would say overall, on the sales side, we feel like we have better momentum. We started the first of the year slow, the first half. In the back half, we're coming out with better momentum on the sales side across the board. And that includes insurance, retirement, everything is stronger in the second half. Most everything is stronger in the second half. On net client, we only talk about it really after the year is over, and so, with all the things going on, I'd continue to wait until we get done with the year to talk about it. --  :Okay. And just lastly, a clarification. So, the fiscal '19 guidance, the preliminary outlook there was super helpful. You talked about approximately 36% operating margins inclusive of reinvestments. Can you clarify how much reinvestment is baked into that 36%? --  :We'll talk about that in the fourth quarter, Jason because then I'm gonna get into a reconciliation exercise, which I'm not ready to do yet. So, we'll talk more. But you can see that -- I'd say two things. One is that we indicated where we'd end the year, so you can see where we will be versus the run rate where we -- or the average for 2018. And you can also get a sense, Jason, from where we were on our initial guidance, what kind of investments we're making. So, that's the general direction I'd give. --  :Okay. Thank you, guys. --  :All right. Okay.Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. --  :Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe to follow up on the prior question a little bit more, previously, last quarter, I think you talked about a bit of a negative mix shift in terms of client size to the smaller clients from the larger clients or the midmarket clients. Is that still in effect heading into fiscal '19? And if it is, I guess that implies that your client count, at least among the smaller clients, could be up nicely. You're able to hold the same pricing dynamics of 2%, as you had. So, I just want to test if those are indeed correct assumptions. --  :I would say this, Jim, that compared to the quota a year ago, we're seeing some of that pressure easing. So, we'll see as we -- the tricky part of calling the year in the third quarter is that there's still a fourth quarter to go. So, we'll see where we end, but we think some of those pressures are starting to ease somewhat. --  :Got it. And then just to -- maybe if you could clarify what you just said there a little bit. Does that imply that the pricing pressure you have called out in the midmarket is abating slightly? Or is that more of a statement about the down-market selling momentum? --  :No. It's really a comment about the mix shift we were experiencing the same quarter a year ago. We're not experiencing the same level of mix shift we were one year ago. And so, we would expect as we go through the year that to continue to normalize or to stabilize. --  :Understand. And then just a follow up for me, if I could. With respect to the investment portfolio, I think you had called out last quarter that you may be considering some more wholesale changes given the impact of tax reform and the various moving parts in terms of both the types of investments you're making as well as the duration. Could you maybe just comment on whether we can expect some of those more wholesale changes to play out? And if so, what you're contemplating? --  :Yeah. So, you know and everyone who's followed us knows we have tended to be pretty heavily weighted in municipal bonds. With the advent of tax reform, corporate look like a potential opportunity. And when we look at the after tax reforms on corporate, it looks like there may be some advantage at current rates to tilting a bit more toward corporate. So, we're evaluating that. We're in the process of thinking about that. And you could see more corporate bonds in the portfolio.I recognize it's very easy to say, ""Well, on an after tax basis, it really won't make that much of a difference. It could have a modest after tax impact."" So, we're looking at all of that and trying to factor in what we think by the time we get to fourth quarter when we issue the guidance what we think the right mix for the portfolio is based on our assumption of what the fed's gonna do over the next nine to 12 months. So, that's where our thinking is right now. Nothing's set in stone. That's why I didn't call out that specific item when I talked a bit about '19. So, that's where our thinking is currently. --  :Helpful. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Brian Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. --  :Hi, guys. I just wanna ask about the operating margin. The fiscal year '19 -- Efrain, I think you talked about 36%. Just curious, is there any one-time investment in fiscal year '19 that won't continue going forward? Just trying to get a sense of the real continuous operating margin thereafter. --  :Yeah. I think Brian, we'll update when we're in fourth quarter. But some of that spending clearly is temporary over a couple year period. We'll start some of it in '18, and it will extend into '19. But then you'll start to see some of that spending come down as we exit '20. So, some of the spending occurs in '19. Some of the spending at this point we're thinking extends into '20. And then we see some of the spending roll off. So, we'll come back to you when we issue guidance at the end of the year. --  :Okay. Well, that's helpful. On the effective tax rate, I know with tax reform, the corporate rate went down to 21%. The fourth quarter effective tax rate is much higher than that, 30% to 31%. And then for the full year of '19, it doesn't quite get down to 21%. It gets to 24. So, just curious on puts and takes on those tax rate? --  :Yeah. Two quick things. First thing is on '19 is while the fed rate is 21%, you've gotta bake in state taxes which are for us, at least, between three and four. That's why you don't get quite down to 21%. So, that's part. And then with respect to 2018, you only have a partial year effect of tax reform. That's why you don't quite get down to the run rate in fiscal year '19. That's after you've filtered out all of the one-timers that we've got in there that devalue the revaluation. Not the valuation, but revaluation of deferred taxes. So, when you net it out, in very, very broad terms, you're getting about five months of benefit in 2018. In 2019, you get 12 months of benefit. And remember always, it's not just 21%. It's also state tax. And there's other puts and takes, but that's basically what's going on. --  :Yeah. I thought the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter though was higher? --  :The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is. But the way taxes are booked is you're booking at the annual rate for taxes in the quarter. Not the tax rate for that specific quarter. So, when you do the catchup in Q3, you adjust to what you think the run rate will be excluding the discreet items. And then you carry through that same rate based on whatever So, you're not doing a discreet tax rate for the fourth quarter. That's why that rate is where it's at. --  :Got it. Got it. And then last one for me. I know you said 7% up in new sales in the smaller market. Is there a metric there for new sales growth rate in that midmarket where there was a little bit more challenge in what that grew? --  :No. We really don't break it out that much. I guess I'd say the point that I was making on the midmarket side is payroll alone and those bundles continue to be very competitive. And it's just a more difficult -- it's about the same as it has been in a difficult, competitive environment. We feel better on that PEO side, which is in that midmarket and selling the complete PEO suite of services where that's continued to be very strong. And again, on the small market, that's kind of a component of the small business sales. So, what we're saying is sales to new businesses is up 7% higher than it was last third quarter. --  :Okay, great. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. --  :Hey, good morning Marty and Efrain. Marty, as you look at the payroll business and the payroll service revenue growth, do you think in essence, it'll be a 1% to 2% grow over the next few years? The reason I say that, we're in a very good economic environment. Seems like you guys are executing well. Or do you feel as though that business, the core business grow much better than that? --  :Well, I think certainly, we're looking for more than that. I think it's been a bit challenging on that low end from a -- sometimes from a price perspective. Although, when we build the bundles in, we're getting more prices, as Efrain mentioned earlier. And then I think we're hoping for a little bit stronger than that on what it's gonna be on a go forward basis, but that's where we've been for the last two years. But I do think that it can be stronger than that. We just gotta get a little bit more effective. And I think some of the investments we're making on the marketing side in particular for demand generation -- the world has changed. And while we've been making changes on lead generation to the small side, and we've made changes in the selling approach where we've sold more of those very low end over the phone and through web leads, I think we're gonna be even more effective on that next year. So, I think it's got some upside to it. I think we're continuing to evolve the way we get demand generation and as well as selling. --  :And then Efraim, as you look at the interest on funds held for clients, do you think based on wage growth and some of the other things that you've talked about, that we should start seeing growth in the flow portfolio? --  :Yeah, I haven't gone through the numbers, but we had 1% growth, Kartik, this quarter. So, I'd anticipate that we'll have at least modest growth in the portfolio next year in the absence of some change in the direction of the mix shift that we've seen over the last couple of years. --  :And then just one last question, Efrain. Just for clarification, when you talked about 2019 impact margins at 36%, I'm assuming that excludes the flow portfolio revenue and impact from that. Correct? --  :So, no. I said operating margin. I just want to be careful. It's operating margins. So, that would include income from the float, but I didn't give you any guidance as to what that float will be because at this point, I don't have a good feel for where the fed rate rises are gonna be. So, that wasn't provided in that discussion. --  :Thank you. I appreciate it.Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. --  :Hi. Thanks. So, let me just -- --  :Hi, Gary. --  :that last one. So, the 36% is your gap operating margin outlook excluding any non-recurring items that come up? --  :Yes. That's correct. --  :So, that's down a couple hundred basis points year over year. And I guess, part of that would be the acquisition because you said that would be dilutive. Part of it's the investment. But you're not yet willing to talk about certain underlaying trend before that. Is that right? --  :That's correct. It's the investments plus the impact of acquisitions. That's correct, Gary. --  :Okay. All right. And so, if I could just ask two bigger picture questions. Could you give us a quick update on how you're thinking about the international strategy? We know you've been in Germany a long time, but it's never really grown to the point of being material. Now you're doing another acquisition that it sounds like brings some better technology. Do you plan to really ramp investment at this at any point? Should we think that it has the potential to become more material contributor to your overall growth in the next few years? Or what's the strategy? --  :Yeah. The strategy is that I think -- while we've been in Germany -- and it's been a service model, like more of a payroll specialist model type of thing. It hasn't been as much of a play on the technology side in Germany. We've grown OK there, but it's not gotten, certainly as you mentioned, significant from the way the company has grown from $2 to over $3 billion in revenue. It's not gonna get that significant. However, we continue to look on the acquisition side for opportunities to grow in Europe. We think there was an opportunity to have particularly, a low-end product that was payroll and HR. And then we think there was a nice opportunity there to grow because we didn't see as much competition on the low-end and that they were at a place where we could acquire something. So, we've had a couple of things we've looked at. And then Lessor, we felt, was very strong because it's already a platform in four different countries, including Germany.And so, that'll give us a stronger, self-serve technology solution on the low-end and a midmarket solution in Germany from a technology standpoint. And they're already selling in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and very strong, particularly in Denmark, and have a platform that can grow into other western European countries. So, will it get significant compared to $3.5 billion in revenue? I'm not sure. But it continues to offer opportunities for growth and profitable growth at that. And the other thing about Lessor was that they had a very strong development team and a very experienced leadership team. So, we felt that the leadership team and development team is there in place and ready to build out that platform to grow not only in the existing four countries that they're in, but in many more in the future. --  :Is there an opportunity to drop some of the technology and development that you've done with the flex offering into that market to accelerate what they're doing or improve their offering? --  :Well, I think yeah. I think certainly the expertise will be shared between the IT teams. They have a good IT leader there who has many years of experience, and he'll work very closely with the IT leadership team here that's working on Flex, our mobility platform, and all of our integration in the cloud for HR and payroll. So, Lessor will certainly benefit, I believe, from the IT team here. But they've got a very strong development team themselves. That was one of the things that really was attractive to us is it's not just a service model where everyone's calling in, and the payroll specialist is doing everything. We have that in Germany. This was adding a technology solution that has performed extremely well and is very much a leader in particularly, Denmark. And we think it can grow. --  :Great. And then just a last one for me. Yeah. Given the competitive intensity and a lot of chatter especially among investors around the competitive outlook with the software plays, I wonder if you could just give us a high-level update on SurePayroll and how that's gone since you've acquired it. I know it was certainly growing robustly early on after you acquired it. But is that a channel to upgrade people to the more full-service model? Or is it an opportunity if people are agitating for a different offering from your core base to push them into that product? Or is it really being run separately right now in just another growth vehicle? Any color on where that's at? Thank you. --  :Yeah. Sure has continued to perform very well from a growth perspective of sales and retention. It's very much more of a do-it-yourself technology play. If anything, we've seen the opportunities there of upgrading. If you're Sure, and you're continuing to grow, and you want the full breadth of products and services, you tend to go to Paychex and the Flex platform. And we have a process in place that we've had for many years where they can refer clients up not only based on whether they see it as an individual or not but the data analytics as well that will say, ""These clients are ready to move and would be better placed on Flex,"" and we work clients through that.But it's been a very good low-end entry model for clients who wanna do it themselves, set themselves up, and that's one of the reasons that we kept that brand separate as part of Paychex, but it had that brand that competes very effectively, I think with some of the low-end, lower-priced competitors who want a do-it-yourself product. So, they've continued to perform very well and certainly at or above our expectations. --  :And Gary, what I'd say too just to build on what Marty said -- so, Sure informs us of what the part of the market that wants a less expensive, do-it-yourself product is really looking for. But also, Flex has significant self-service capabilities itself. So, what was your traditional full-service outsourcing in the past is much more hybrid right now. And so, if you want more feature functionality, you move to Flex. If you want a more basic system, you can be very well served by SurePayroll. And I think that what's happening in the market or what will continue to evolve in the market -- and this goes everywhere from all the way from SurePayroll to Flex, frankly even to the PEO offering, is that people are self-selecting on the kind of service they want. If they want very little, they'll go DIY fast. If they want more, they'll go to Flex. If they want comprehensive outsourcing, they'll go to a PEO. And we see that continuum continuing to evolve as we move into the future. --  :That's helpful color. Thank you. --  :Okay.Thank you. Next question coming from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. --  :Thank you. So, I think this question's come up in different forms a couple forms a couple of times on the call, just the dynamic with growth in the core payroll business. But my recollection was that we had some midmarket retention issue in the prior year and perhaps some pricing associated with that and that perhaps we're anniversaring those losses now, which is helping put some upward lift into the payroll growth rate going forward. So, first, am I getting that right? Am I remembering this right? And if so, how do we think about what your expectations are for that unit pricing dynamic going forward and court payroll. Is 1% to 2% really at this stage of maturity, what we should be thinking for the business? Or should we be thinking differently now that you've got an opportunity to invest at a different rate? --  :So, David, great compound question there. So, let me parse it into three pieces. So, the first part of your question, yes. That's correct. We're anniversaring some of the effects that you did mention. I'd say it's less about losses and more about what the mix of sales was a year ago. Less midmarket, more small market. So, I think we're starting to anniversary some of that. And also, client retention plays into that picture. That's Part A. Part B, the pricing dynamic. So, we've always said it's one to three. You can continue to price at that level, especially if you deliver value for the products that you provide to clients. So, if you provide excellent service, clients are very willing to consider those kinds of price increases. I think what's changed is the going in price when you sell now is more competitive. And that's a little bit more challenging. But you still have an opportunity to price in the range that we've been saying you can. And I didn't get the last part of the question. --  :Well, the last part of the question really was how to think about that pricing unit equation going forward and perhaps what's assumed in your preliminary fiscal '19 guide because it sounds like in the last 12 months at least, we've got probably 0% to 1% unit growth. And the balance of the growth came from pricing. How should we think about unit growth going forward? Does that pose a challenge to the company? And I was curious whether or not, now that you've got the tax rate, benefits of reinvest at a higher rate. Should we be hopeful at least that we can get some acceleration in that unit growth? --  :I think that that's a fair comment. Some of those investments are gonna be geared to precisely that. And I think you're right that that's where we're gonna be putting some of our effort. --  :Yeah. I think a couple things. One is that, David, I think that's very right. As I mentioned earlier, some of the investments are pushing more toward accelerated marketing and demand generation. I think we were slower to this than we should have been as far as picking up more leads on the web and then being able to close them more effectively. I think we've made some big changes this year into that. It's starting to pay off, and we'll continue to accelerate that. There's just a changing -- I don't wanna say it's drastic, like it's everything. But there's a changing model here, where, as you'd expect, more people are searching, researching, and deciding online, and then making the call very quickly.So, it's gotta have this balance that we've been investing more in the virtual sales team. You've gotta have this balance of virtual sales, telephonic sales who handle those leads and close the sales and focus in the field on the larger clients even than some of the ones that come in on leads because on the leads, they're ready to buy and do it over the phone or over a WebEx type of thing. They just wanna see it, research it, and buy it. So, we're seeing that change. And then on the midmarket, we definitely did see better retention this year than we did last year on the midmarket sales and through the end of the year. So, that was a real positive for us. And I think that's just more comprehensive product, better service, and so forth. --  :Got it. So, thanks for the clarification on that. And I had just two quick follow ups. One was just on the WSE growth, I just wanna make sure that I heard that right. Did you say 20% growth in WSEs on an organic basis? Or was that the client growth. --  :That was WSE growth, not clients. So, that's correct. That's what we had for the PEO, by the way. That's what we're talking about. --  :And that just seems like an extraordinarily high number to me based on fiscal -- I thought we were tracking in the 10% to 12% range. So, am I remembering that right? Because that seems like a big number to me. And if it is, what changed? --  :I think as usual, David, your memory is good, and you are getting it right. It was 20%. We had a very -- --  :And retention. And retention, as well. --  :Yeah. We had a good quarter. Yeah. --  :Was that a competitive dynamic? Was it a market dynamic? I mean, that just seems like close to two extra growth rate -- or where it had been trending. And just curious. Is there some change in the business that would drive that kind of exceptional acceleration? --  :I'd say a couple things. So, we have made a big investment in sales execution on the PEO side. And those things don't occur overnight, and we're getting benefit from that. And I would say that's really probably the No. 1 reason why we're seeing that kind of benefit. --  :I think also, in the sales side as Efrain mentioned, also retention. As I've said, we've been able to perform very well, and therefore, we've been able to have very good plans, insurance plans, and pricing on those plans. And I think we definitely saw a nice improvement in retention as well. So, on both sides of the organic PEO -- this is without HROI -- we've performed very well. And we've been very focused on it as well. --  :Yeah. I just wanna -- David, one other caveat to that is we're just talking about PEO. It's not necessarily ASO. At year-end, we update our entire worksite employee number, which includes our lower-end product, the ASO, and the PEO. We still have more clients on the ASO, more worksite employees on the ASO, but we put a lot of focus on PEO because we think there's opportunity there, and it's starting to pay benefits. --  :Right. But there was no increase in the risk profile of the business in terms of at risk on health insurance or anything like that? --  :Absolutely. There is no increase on the risk profile. And of course, we monitor that very carefully. --  :Great. All right, guys. Thanks very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is now open. --  :Thanks, guys for the time. Just two questions here real quick. First, I noticed on I think page 5 of the press release, you guys took out the $0.10 impact from the change in annual effect, the tax rate of $36 million there. But it looks like year to date, it was not taken out. It was left alone. So, you got the 194 versus 184 if you just add up each quarter individually. Is that fair? And then does that imply about $0.60 for 4Q for the full year guidance? How should we think about that? --  :I would have to look at that, Jim. I think it should be spelled out pretty clearly in our investor presentation. --  :Okay. And then quick follow up just on the Lessor group. Just commenting on some of the target markets you see beyond the ones that you're currently exposed to there in Europe. And if you could give any detail around the margin or the growth rate of the company, that'd be great too. Thanks. --  :Jim, could you just say that one again? I couldn't catch that last part. I think it was on the European -- on Lessor. --  :Yeah. So, you talked about some of the markets that they're currently in and the ability to realize revenue synergies hopefully in Germany over time, but what are some of the other markets that you think you could expand into beyond the ones that it's exposed to now? --  :Sure. I think there's already some work being done on a product that would get into Spain or France and Poland. So, I think the other markets -- something that we haven't been able to do because we didn't wanna necessarily put the investment into the development of each platform -- we're at a stage now and Lessor is at a stage that we found that has a solid platform and a way to update and build out those platforms for various countries at an effective way. They are profitable, and we believe that their whole service model, which is very much a do-it-yourself model is gonna be a good way to go in Europe right now as we move forward. And with the success that they've seen in those four countries, we think that we can easily expand to others. Our focus right now will be, ""Hey, how do we drive penetration in those four countries, but then after that, expand to others probably more 18 to 24 months down the road?"" --  :Great, thanks a lot. --  :Jim, I think I understood your question. And I apologize because I was not tracking. So, when you look at the table, the $0.10 really relates to Q3. And it's the catchup that now gets Q3 to close to 30% when you make the adjustment in that quarter. You're catching up those first two quarters. That's why Q3 is low. And then you exit the year at around that rate. There's puts and takes there. So, if that's not clear, just give me a buzz back, and we can talk about it further. --  :Okay. All right. Yeah. Thanks a lot. I'll just follow up with you on the call back.Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is now open. --  :Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Hey. Just a high-level question. I know you mentioned some of the metrics highlighting the tightness of the labor market and wage inflation for earnings picking up. I'm just curious, in light of that kind of environment with the entire labor market, what's changed for your sales or demand from your perspective? --  :Well, I think we're not having as strong a -- the recovery was very long and slow from additional jobs and new business start-ups. New business start-ups have now gotten back to where they were pre-recession a long time ago now and seem to be holding. And the jobs, the job growth is back to a normalized component, at least in our review. This is clients under -- this is businesses under 50 employees is what we focus that on. We're back to a normalized growth of businesses and employment growth back to 2004, which was our base year. And then the wages should pick up some. So, we've seen wage growth that held under 2% for pretty consistently until about a year ago. Now it's starting to tick up.We actually saw very close to 3%, which was nice and strong. And now it's drifted back into that 2.7%, which is a little strange. But I think it's gonna end up closer to that 3% because of the shortage of employees with specific skills and so forth. Plus, you're also seeing at the very low end, a lot of minimum wage increases are going into effect. So, when you put that in, depending on the time of the year, you're gonna see something probably closer to 3%. And in those front end jobs, you're gonna see something stronger, even probably 4% to 5%. And I think all that bodes well for checks. Also, what really bodes well is that with that job growth and wage growth, more and more businesses small and midsized are gonna need products that are full payroll and HR outsourcing. --  :Got it. Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And that leads to the follow-up question. For the investments that you're making, I'm just curious, what's driving the decision to ramp up investments? And any color you can give on what these investments are. Is it focused on sales and execution in light of the more positive environment? Or any color you can give. That'd be great. --  :Yeah. I think you always wanna spend more to accelerate growth. And so, we wanted to take advantage of some the tax reform benefit to do that. So, what we're finding is technology spends. So, were we -- particularly in the client interface. So, from our mobility platforms and what we're building into our mobility platform. That's been very popular with clients. The reporting platform, the analytics, all of the things that clients want and the HR administration piece of it. There's always things that we wanna do faster than we already have to be ahead of competition, and we decided that given this benefit to us, because we are a very profitable company, this is a good time to reinvest and accelerate a few of these projects that are on our roadmap.And so, you'll see enhancements to a client interface in both mobility and in the breadth of products as well, and we're accelerating those. If you look at marketing, the marketing spend will go up as well as the sales spend because we think with new marketing generation tools and a bigger spend and a more focused spend, that we can get more leads into Paychex and that we'll be able to close more sales with the focus of those leads. So, we're putting more emphasis on our marketing leads, our marketing spend, and in demand generation, as well as you'll see the sales team grow. We're not right at this point ready to say how much it'll grow, but there'll be a combination of growth between the virtual or telephonic sales teams and the field sales teams because we think the opportunity is there to sell more if we had more people out there, which is a good thing. --  :Got it. Okay, great. Thanks so much for the color.Thank you. Our last question coming from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is now open. --  :Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Had a few questions, kind of cleanups. But on the investments and as they relate to the operating margin going to 36% for 2019, where would they fall in terms of between direct operating expenses versus SGNA? How should we think about that, No. 1? And No.2, as it relates to that specific item, it sounds like some of that's gonna continue through 2020. But once we normalize, how should we think about the pattern of margin expansion and pace of margin expansion going forward once we get through that investment phase?That's No. 1. No. 2 -- and I'll be glad to repeat these -- No. 2, on the PEO side, where you were getting the wins, are those primarily coming from clients that have existing PEO relationships? Or are you seeing a lot of white space out there where you're selling into clients that don't have a current PEO? And how does that make you think about the PEO market? And No. 3, you didn't buy back any stock this quarter. Wondering was that because of Lessor? How should we think about that? --  :Let me start with the PEO one. Efrain can jump in on the stock one and the others. 1) On the PEO, I think it's a combination, Mark. I think we certainly have been able to win over with our service and our plans and our pricing and sales execution existing PEO clients in a number of markets. So, I think we've had very competitive offerings that have done well. I also think we're selling PEO -- we also have seen experience with selling PEO to some new clients that have not had PEO before. And as I mentioned earlier, I think it's continuing to evolve that more and more clients are looking for that HR support. And the co-employment is getting more known -- not only because of us, but because of competitors out there as well -- that that's becoming more known and more comfortable with clients who have not experienced that before because of tax reform, because of all of the HR requirements, because of healthcare. Things are changing.It's probably one of the most confusing times we've ever had from what federal government is doing in and of the federal government, the state governments, I've mentioned before. Regulations are going up. Minimum wage changes, Family Leave Act changes. There's never been a time, frankly, when there's been probably more confusion as to what I have to do, particularly if I'm a multi-state business. So, I think PEO for us has definitely been both those who already have it and those who don't have it but are now finding it as a good alternative. --  :Mary, is it silly to think that -- I mean, take all your comments together -- sounds like a pretty obvious opportunity, no? --  :Definitely Definitely. And that's why, as Efraim mentioned, I think I've mentioned, we've put more sales teams toward this. This was behind acquisition of HROI. We felt it was a very good PEO that was doing some things different than we were, and they were very effective. They're ahead of what we expected from them. And it's early, just from last August. So, I think this is definitely an opportunity, and you're seeing us put more investment in the PEO and from a sales and execution standpoint and chronic standpoint. --  :So, the more you put in, the more encouraged you're getting. --  :Yes. I would definitely say that right now. Yup. --  :Hey, Mark, as to your question on the split between the investment -- so, let me just bracket them. I can't give you a direct answer yet. I've got to wait till fourth quarter. But in part, it's because they're -- some of the categories may shift between our current -- --  :Sure. And part of it is just an allocation that's objective. --  :But let me just generally say that a reasonable way to think about it is that about a third of the investments would be on the operating expense side, and two thirds would be on SGNA. Just before I go further, let's just remember that in our business, IT is in GNA. So, that's why two thirds is going into SGNA. Marty mentioned sales and marketing demand driven spending. That will be one focus, and then lots of IT projects that were on the board and that we're accelerating forward to try to get in over the next couple of years or so or accelerate the opportunities we get from doing that. So, more to come in Q4, and we can talk about it then. On the share buyback, we buy back for dilution. If you look back at where we were in the quarter, we're not too far from we're expected to be. We'll do more buying as we head into first quarter of next year. --  :Okay. And just going back on just the pace of margin expansion once we get past the early part of fiscal '20 and -- --  :Yeah. So, I think when we get beyond that, I'll reserve discussion on how quickly we can expand margins. But it would certainly be our expectation getting through this period that we continue to expand margin. And part of the investment is intended to drive that as we come out of the period. How quickly? We'll have to see how the projects go and how they pay off. But that's clearly in the forefront of our mind. --  :Yeah. The idea of these investments and in taking some of the benefit from tax reform spend is to drive better and stronger topline and sustainable topline growth. And that will start to bring the margin back as opposed to just trying to look at where we're cutting costs. We've always been good at keeping costs out. We're pretty targeted as to where these investments are gonna be and hopefully how long they're gonna last and then start to see margin improvement because of the growth in the topline back into the ranges that we had in the past. --  :Great. And then just thinking about the balance sheet and the strength of it and the strength of the free cash flow and the sustainability of it, you mentioned you might change a little bit what you're doing in terms of the investments on the float balance. How are you thinking about just the balance sheet in general, just given the recurring nature of the cash flows and the strength of the business, leverage levels, things of that nature? --  :Yeah, Mark. What I'd say is as we looked at tax reform, another bucket that we targeted was at the margin being able to do more MNA. I think the fact that we did Lessor in Q3 is the first indicator of that. We will be active in looking at opportunities. At this stage, none transformational. But we think we have obviously a lot of ability to do the right kinds of MNA, and we think there's targets out there that are of interest to us. --  :Great. Thank you very much. --  :Yeah, thanks.Thank you. At this time, there are no questions over the phone. Speakers, you may proceed. --  :Thank you. At this point, we'll close the call.

 , a leading business service provider, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 22. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion's share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Cintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas' customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater to more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is pegged at $1,279 million, up from $993.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Total quarterly revenues are expected to be $1,568 million, up from $1,281 million reported in the year-earlier period.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 0.00%, as both are pegged at $1.24. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture plc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.07% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .Red Hat, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank #3.Paychex Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.59% and a Zacks Rank #3.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 22. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this memory chip maker will be able to continue its upbeat performance in the quarter or not.Notably, Micron has delivered positive earnings surprises for nine straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 10.2%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Our proven model conclusively shows that Micron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Micron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.26%. You can see  .The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter's earnings is pegged at $2.76, which is 206.7% higher than the year-ago quarter's earnings of 90 cents. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.23 billion, up 55.5% from the prior-year quarter tally. | Let's see what's driving this overwhelming expectation.The main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improved prices for DRAM. Increased pricing is mainly driven by better product-mix optimization, and higher-than-anticipated demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.Notably, DRAM generates majority of the company's revenues, and in first-quarter fiscal 2018 it contributed approximately 67%. The company witnessed a year-over-year surge of a whopping 88% in DRAM revenues in the last reported quarter.Smartphone makers and cloud data-center operators will be the key growth drivers for DRAM chips. As per data compiled by DRAMeXchange, smartphones witnessed an increase of 33.4% in DRAM content in 2017, to an average of 3.2 GB per device. As smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) plan to roll out devices with higher capacity, and more demanding applications like AR and AI, demand for DRAM is likely to grow much faster.Furthermore, server DRAM demand is anticipated to remain strong as cloud data-center customers seek innovative solutions to reduce workload. The high-density modules based on advanced manufacturing nodes have come to the market, urging server OEMs to overhaul and shift to new technology for better results. This is likely to drive Micron's top- and bottom-line results in the to-be-reported quarter.Last fiscal, the company witnessed impressive growth in NAND revenues due to the huge demand-supply gap which hugely escalated chip prices. However, we expect the segment's growth rate to be moderate this quarter as the supply-demand gap has narrowed down significantly, according to various research firms, which is affecting the chip prices adversely.Notably, in the fiscal first quarter, Micron witnessed a mid-single-digit rise in bit shipments, while average selling price (ASP) declined in the low-single-digit range. Therefore, looking at the current scenario, we believe decline in ASP will negatively impact the company's NAND revenues and margins, and somewhat offset the benefits from improved demand and prices for DRAM products.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat: has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank of 3. has an Earnings ESP of +0.59% and a Zacks Rank of 3. has an Earnings ESP of +0.03% and a Zacks Rank of 3.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

"emember during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when pundits liked to talk about the ""new economy""? Riding the wave of excitement, the information technology sector grew to well over 30% of the S&P 500, from under 10% less than a decade earlier. The mania ended as companies like Pets.com disappeared while others, such as  and Yahoo!, experienced traumatic share-price declines. It may sound negative to rehash those times, but here's the thing: The experts weren't entirely wrong.While the mania of the late '90s got out of hand, the basic premise of the new economy has continued to play out. We are indeed transitioning from an industrial, manufacturing-based economy into one characterized more by services and information-based commerce. This evolution has opened new markets and new opportunities within industries that barely existed a few decades ago.  has grown into the largest company in the world by making the iPhone,  publishes video games that consume countless hours of leisure time, and  gives you a way to connect with friends new and old. These businesses all grew to be the giants they are by creating new demand and making their industries larger.And it isn't just a service-based economy that makes this industry so successful. These companies are built on the foundation of an incredibly profitable business model. This point can be easy to forget when we're constantly hearing about start-up unicorns like Uber that hand out stock options like candy and seem unconcerned about ever earning a profit. But the more mature businesses have already figured it out. Facebook, for example, keeps an astonishing 40 cents of profit for every dollar of revenue it records. Granted, very few businesses will ever reach that Hall-of-Fame level of success, but investors should be happy settling for a nice collection of All-Stars.Image source: Getty Images.The secret behind the success of companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google parent  is the concept of incremental margins. After  puts in the effort to make its software, it gets to keep a larger portion of the cash from every additional dollar it earns. It isn't rewriting its software from scratch every time somebody new buys a copy of Windows, and it gets to spread out that initial cost over a larger base.This phenomenon isn't unique to software companies -- any business with more fixed costs than variable costs benefits from economies of scale -- but the impact on technology companies can be much more extreme than in other industries. A manufacturer makes more money as it churns out more goods, but eventually, it will reach a physical limit and will be unable to produce more without building a costly new factory. There are diminishing returns. Google, meanwhile, will probably need to add more computers to its network if it grows from 3.5 billion searches per day to 5 billion, but by comparison, that additional cost will be relatively small.Information technology has grown into the largest sector of the economy for a reason. These companies aren't among the world's largest simply because they affixed "".com"" to the end of their names. These are real businesses that earn tremendous profits. As they grow larger, they're also able to use their scale and their vast troves of data to become even more successful. That's a winning business plan.You might be thinking -- isn't investing all about the future? Sure it is, but I'm still searching for a fortune-teller who can successfully pick stocks.We've already discussed how companies like Facebook and Google are able to use their size to create enormous piles of cash. These businesses are then able to reinvest in ongoing research and development. In the past 12 months, Facebook spent more than $7 billion on R&D. That looks downright stingy compared with the $11 billion Apple spent, or Microsoft's $13 billion, or Alphabet's $16 billion. I'm willing to bet that all those investments will lead to something good.It is difficult to fathom just how big of an impact machine learning will have. At the onset of the Industrial Revolution, most people probably couldn't grasp the societal changes that would be coming over the ensuing decades. For craft workers especially, the mass factory production that made their livelihoods obsolete was a very scary thing. Yet it led to unprecedented growth in the standard of living.More recently, personal computers have changed the way many of us do our jobs. Rather than have a secretary to answer our phones and receive messages for us, we carry around smartphones that keep us connected to the office 24 hours a day.Machine learning, and artificial intelligence more broadly, will bring about similar changes. The impact of self-driving vehicles, for example, is easy to envision. In a world where an automated taxi is moments away, will we even need to own cars? Will we be able to replace enormous parking garages with more exciting buildings, or un-pave parking lots to create more parks and green spaces? Perhaps even before that, self-driving vehicles will be used in long-haul trucking.Other uses of machine learning spring to mind. In the near future, machines might be able to better detect and diagnose diseases. Or, less exciting, machine learning will be able to target us with more individualized advertisements.During the California Gold Rush, some miners were undoubtedly able to strike it rich, but many more left empty-handed. The most surefire way to profit from the rush was to sell equipment to all the hopeful prospectors streaming into town -- the so-called ""picks and shovels"" approach. This tried and true strategy has repeated over the history of commerce; Microsoft certainly benefited from selling its word-processing and spreadsheet software to seemingly every business. And these customers also grew and evolved from using the software.In the coming decades, companies will be transformed by the use of data and algorithms. Companies like Alphabet,  , and  will likely be the ones providing the new virtual picks and shovels.Let's back up and examine a fundamental question: What is the information technology sector?This one sector encompasses many different things -- remember, it's nearly a quarter of the  Index, after all. Within this sector, we include all the technology hardware companies, including Apple, Cisco, and  . We also include semiconductor chip companies, such as  and  . Then we throw in everything related to ""software and services,"" which includes not only software-focused companies such as Microsoft and Facebook, but also service-oriented companies such as  ,  , and  .Given how much each of these groups has grown in the past few decades, it's no wonder that this one sector has become disproportionately large. David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, acknowledged this trend when he stated, ""The internet began as a technological approach to sharing information; it has become the way many businesses operate."" While the tech sector has continued to grow, the four smallest sectors -- materials, utilities, real estate, and telecommunications -- combined to account for less than 11% of the S&P 500 at the end of the year.I'm fascinated by the history of industry classification. For example, I'm tickled by idea that the Standard Industrial Classification system the U.S. government created in 1937 concluded that ""Cookies & Crackers"" merited its own industry code. But for the sake of our discussion, let's skip ahead to 1999. That's the year that two of the world's largest index providers, Standard & Poor's and MSCI, teamed up to create a new system called the Global Industry Classification System. This new system had 10 sectors: consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, financials, healthcare, industrials, information technology, materials, telecommunications services, and utilities. It further divided each sector into an additional three layers. Today, there are 11 sectors (real estate graduated to its own sector in 2016), 24 industry groups, 68 industries, and 157 sub-industries.In November, following its annual review, S&P and MSCI announced the latest changes to GICS, to take effect in September 2018. The telecommunications services sector has been demoted to an industry group to be included in a new sector named communications services. This sector will also be the new home for the media and entertainment industry group. Separately, online marketplace companies are going to be reclassified into the consumer discretionary sector; previously, they were split between consumer discretionary and information technology, depending on whether they held their own inventory.Where do these changes leave us? To be quite honest, we don't know yet. The full list of companies affected will be made available in August 2018. It seems likely that Facebook and  will be two of the higher-profile companies that move into the communications services sector. But what about Alphabet? And will  remain classified as consumer discretionary? It's something to keep an eye on as the year progresses, and you should definitely pay attention if you own any sector ETFs or similar products. The seasoned portfolio managers at  have over 50 years of combined professional investing experience. But they're not your typical Wall Street types. They're focused on helping investors like YOU. That's why they just revealed their 5 highest-conviction stocks, which you can get absolutely free in a new special report.

"nvestors in Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) saw new options become available this week, for the April 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PAYX options chain for the new April 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $63.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PAYX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $65.45/share today.Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.92% return on the cash commitment, or 19.07% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of PAYX stock at the current price level of $65.45/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $67.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.27% if the stock gets called away at the April 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PAYX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Net income for the reported quarter was $254.4 million or $1.09 per share compared with $350.3 million or $1.47 per share in the year-ago quarter.

"n recent trading, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $66.52, changing hands for $66.81/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Paychex Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $57.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $74.00. The standard deviation is $5.065.But the whole reason to look at the  PAYX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PAYX crossing above that average target price of $66.52/share, investors in PAYX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $66.52 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Paychex Inc:

 reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 results wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line came in line with the same. However, the company registered year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Non-GAAP earnings per share of 59 cents increased 5% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the stock has returned 10.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming 7% growth recorded by the  .Paychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $826.5 million, up 7% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) were up 7% year over year to $812.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $823 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 1% from the year-ago period to $444.8 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check, which benefited from price increases and net of discounts. However, revenues were negatively impacted by a change in client base mix.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 15% year over year to $367.7 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base across the prominent human capital management (HCM) services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 23% on a year-over-year basis to $14 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses rose 7% from the year-ago quarter to $494.3 million due to increased investments in technology and combined PEO business. Acquisition of HROI accounted for 5% of the total increase in expenses. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 20 basis points (bps) to 59.8%.Operating income grew 7% year over year to $332.2 million. However, Paychex's operating margin decreased 10 bps to 40.2%.Adjusted net income surged 8% year over year to $437.2 million. | Paychex exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $338.6 million compared with $323.4 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. For the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $519.4 million.During the first two quarters, Paychex repurchased 1.6 million shares for $94.1 million.The guidance for fiscal 2018 provided at the end of the first quarter remains unaltered.Total revenues are expected to grow around 6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $3.35 billion.Payroll Services Revenues are anticipated surge between 1% and 2%.Human Resource Services revenues are projected to grow in the range of 12-14%.Operating margin is anticipated to be between 39% and 40%. Effective income tax rate, excluding any potential impact from tax reform legislation, is projected to be 35.0% to 35.5%.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income is expected to grow in the mid-to-upper-teen range.Net income is still likely to advance 5% year over year on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.The company's top-line is benefiting from acquisitions. In the second quarter fiscal 2018, HROI which was acquired in August 2017, added 3% to total service revenue growth.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company's payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter. Additionally, political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing decision making in the mid-market, affected the company's client base.Furthermore, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing, Insperity, Intuit, H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions and DST System is another key concern.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corp.  , Axcelis Technologies Inc.  and Applied Materials, Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"nvestors in Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2018 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PAYX options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of 85 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $64.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PAYX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $69.25/share today.Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.31% return on the cash commitment, or 8.23% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70. If an investor was to purchase shares of PAYX stock at the current price level of $69.25/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.54% if the stock gets called away at the February 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PAYX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Also, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.22%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Paychex is a provider of payroll and integrated human resource, and employee benefits outsourcing solutions. It caters to the small- to medium-sized businesses (SMB) in the United States and is expected to continue benefiting from its strong domain expertise, going ahead.In fact, Paychex's investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are impressive. Also, product launches and joint venture initiatives in a less-than-half-penetrated market are encouraging.Meanwhile, the company's top-line continues to be boosted by its inorganic growth strategies. In this context, Paychex's acquisition of HROI in August is worth mentioning. This is because this buyout is expected to drive this payroll and human resource solutions provider's clientele and revenues.However, the company is facing issues in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. Due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention, the company's payroll client base remained flat in the previous quarter.

"ncome investors like the steady payouts and growth potential that  provide, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index hasn't historically been the first place that such investors have looked to find them. That's changed in recent years, though, as a growing number of big tech companies have matured to the point where more generous dividend payouts are justified. The 10 top-yielding stocks in the Nasdaq's most elite group all sport dividend yields well above the market average, but as savvy income investors know, a high yield doesn't necessarily make a stock worth buying. Let's take a closer look at this list to find the best stocks for the future.Below, you'll find the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Nasdaq 100 as of Dec. 14:
  
Data source: Yahoo! Finance. * Includes special dividend.The first thing one might notice about this list is that it's a fairluy diverse group of companies considering the index it's drawn from. On a market-capitalization weighted basis, the Nasdaq 100 gets about 60% of its value from technology stocks, with consumer discretionary and healthcare lagging far behind at 21% and 10% respectively. Yet we see above a telecom stock, a food giant, an industrial company, a biotech leader, and a payroll and business services specialist , in addition to representatives from the hardware, software, and services segments of the information technology sector.Another positive feature of this list of top-yielding Nasdaq dividend stocks is that it doesn't include many companies with substantial dividend risk. Seagate Technology has been making some income investors nervous for quite a while, but despite its ongoing financial challenges, the company has steadfastly maintained its payout. Bullish investors are hopeful that a transition from old-style hard disk drives to flash memory chips and solid state drives could help  , and for now, high demand for massive data-center storage has given new life to its old core product line.Image source: Nasdaq.Vodafone is the other true high-yield player on this list, and it's generally regarded as a global leader in wireless telecom.  , but that was largely the result of accounting-based moves to take advantage of tax benefits. With most of its revenue coming from Europe, but with meaningful exposure to emerging nations, Vodafone taps into the growth potential of telecom while still enjoying the stability of being a leader in some of the best-established markets in the world.Finally, dividend investors should remember that they can make money in multiple ways by owning the right stocks. A number of potential catalysts could benefit these particular companies.For instance, Qualcomm recently got a  from  , valuing the tech giant at more than $100 billion. Investors have already seen a big jump in the share price, and although Qualcomm rejected the initial bid, there's room for further gains in shares if Broadcom comes back with a higher number.Dividend growth is also an option. Amgen recently said it would boost its payout another 15% in 2018 -- unusual among biotechnology firms, which generally reinvest a greater portion of their earnings into further research and development. PACCAR, the truck specialist, traditionally declares a special dividend each year; the $1.20 per share payout it will make in early January boosts what would be a rather pedestrian 1.5% yield without it to the more than 3% yield it enjoys today.Growth opportunities also play a key role in fostering share-price gains. Although some of the names above aren't exactly growth engines, they each have opportunities to keep building on their success.The Nasdaq isn't well-known for its dividends, but even this tech-heavy index can produce some worthwhile buys for income investors. Those who want their portfolios to include the  in the market can't afford to ignore it any longer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: PAYX)Q2 2018 Dec. 21, 2017, Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question and answer session of today's conference. To ask a question, you may press *1 and record your name at the prompt. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now, I'll turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may now begin. -- Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter, ended November 30th, 2017. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on the website for approximately one month. On today's call, I'll review the business highlights for the second quarter and Efrain will review our second-quarter financial results and discuss full-year guidance, and then we'll open it up to your questions.Well, we are halfway through fiscal 2018, and we have continued to deliver solid results across all of our major human capital management product lines, with growth of 7% in total service revenue for the second quarter. In particular, our HR outsourcing services, retirement services, and time and attendance solutions have continued to perform very well. On August 21st, we announced our acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc., or HROI. HROI is a national PEO that serves small- and mid-sized businesses in more than 35 states. The integration of HROI has progressed favorably. Combining the HROI team with our experienced PEO sales and service operations teams has further strengthened our presence in the PEO market. This is particularly relevant during a time of regulatory change like we're seeing now. This expansion -- along with our certification by the IRS under the Small Business Efficiency Act -- positions us for accelerated growth in our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Paychex wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!Small business job growth continued to moderate slightly during the second quarter after the sharper uptick experienced last year following the conclusion of the presidential election. By contrast, hourly earnings have improved to an annual increase of nearly 3% based on our data. The combination of this level of wage growth and consistent moderate small business job growth are indicators of a healthy small business sector. We believe these promising indicators will continue to create opportunities for new sales in the small business market.At HR Tech in October, we introduced our new product bundles that are now on the market. These bundles include new simplified pricing, and included in two of the mid-level HCM bundles at no extra cost are Paychex Flex Onboarding Essentials, providing a paperless employee onboarding experience, and do-it-yourself handbooks. In addition, we introduced a retina scan InVision time clock. We are excited about these new offerings that respond to the evolving needs of our clients, and we are pleased with the initial response from our clients and prospects.We are committed to delivering best-in-class technology solutions for our clients and business partners. We recently announced the release of same-day ACH debit functionality for our clients using direct deposit. With same-day ACH, employers have the ability to reverse a payroll and have money debited from employee bank accounts on the same day, avoiding the costly time lag associated with payroll reversals. This enhances our position as a leader in the payments industry.We also announced real-time integration between Paychex general ledger services and Sage Intacct. Paychex and Intacct are certainly two key service providers to the accounting industry, and our CPA partners are important to our business, and this integration provides better tools which allow them to gain insight into their data and their clients' data on a real-time basis.We also introduced Accountant HQ, a website for accounting professionals to help them service their Paychex clients even more effectively with a comprehensive online dashboard that provides a single source of immediate service, access to authorized Paychex client data, robust reporting capabilities, and valuable accountant resources.We consistently evolve our service offerings to meet the needs of our client base. An example is that we just had a recent announcement that Millennium Trust Company and Paychex have teamed up to offer a simple IRA to employers with 100 or fewer employees with innovative features including auto-enrollment and investment fiduciary services. This is becoming a popular requirement from some states across the U.S.We are proud of the recognition we have received regarding our solutions for our clients and our leading-edge technology.  . recently recognized Paychex as the best HR outsourcing for small business overall. They noted that our product Paychex Flex offers a full range of services for HR outsourcing, including payroll tax, payment, benefits, recruiting, and training, and we do so without requiring a long-term contract. More uniquely, Paychex also offers an on-site assistance program that puts HR professionals -- our HR generalists, or HRGs -- in the office with customers when they need more help.We are proud that Paychex Flex was recently awarded a Gold Excellence in Technology Award for Best Advance in HR or Workforce Management Technology for Small- and Mid-Sized Businesses from Brandon Hall Group. In previous years, we won the bronze award. This year, we moved up to the gold standard, and we appreciate that. This shows evidence of the strength of our technology as well as our service performance.As I noted last quarter, this is the seventh consecutive year we were ranked the largest 401(k) record keeper by total number of defined contribution plans by  magazine, and our Paychex Insurance Agency hit the rank of 21st largest agency from  magazine. We are very proud of all this recognition because it comes from and is deserved by the 14,000 employees that make it happen. From sales, to service, to technology innovation teams here at Paychex, we're very proud of them and the results that they've achieved.Providing excellent service to our clients remains a top priority, of course. We completed the realignment of our service organization at the end of the last fiscal year, and our investment in this service realignment was an important strategy to help support long-term growth, as well as an example of our priority and commitment to providing the best service possible to our clients. With the realignment completed, we are seeing benefits from this change.One last comment before I turn the call over to Efrain: Yesterday, of course, Congress voted in favor of tax reform legislation. We are currently reviewing the terms of the bill and analyzing the impact it could have to Paychex. Efrain will talk more about this later on. Tax reform will provide a great benefit to us and a lower effective tax rate. We do expect that a portion of the potential benefit will be reinvested to drive future growth for the company and our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? -- Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. I'll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, provide greater detail in certain areas, and then wrap up with a review of the 2018 outlook.Service revenue, as you saw, grew 7% for the quarter to $813 million. Approximately 3% -- a little less -- of that growth was attributable to HROI. Interest on funds held for clients increased 23% for the second quarter to $14 million as a result of higher average interest rates. You're starting to see the benefit of all those cumulative increases in interest rates. Expenses increased 7% for the quarter. HROI, though, contributed about 5% of this growth, so we had very good growth expense control in the quarter. Comp-related costs were up modestly, and continued investment in technology and growth from the PEO both contributed to the slight uptick in expenses.Our effective income tax rate was 35% for the second quarter compared to 35.2% for the prior year second quarter. Both periods reflected net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation. This impact to the second quarter accounted for $0.01 of EPS and was immaterial in the prior-year quarter.Let's talk about payroll service revenue. It increased 1% in the second quarter to $445 million. The growth was driven by an increase in revenue per check, and it was tempered by the impact of client size mix from the same quarter a year ago. Recall that as we ended the year, we had a slight drop in client size, and that's reflected in payroll service revenue growth.On the HRS side, we grew 15% to $368 million for the second quarter. It reflected strong growth in the client base across major HCM services, including comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement, time and attendance, and insurance, which all saw good growth in the quarter.Within Paychex HR services, we continue to see strong demand, which -- along with the acquisition of HROI -- is reflected in continued solid growth in the number of client worksite employees served. So, we're seeing growth there and we're seeing growth in other areas of the PEO.Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefits applicants and higher-average premiums within workers' comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue and earned on the value of participant funds. So, all of those are contributing to the positive results in HRS.Year to date, let me just say that total service revenue growth was 5%, of which about 1.5% was attributable to HROI. Recall that Q1 was a lower quarter, and we built from there. Operating income growth was 7% with margins of 41.2%, up approximately 50 basis points year over year. Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 6% on a GAAP basis to $445 million and $1.23 respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were both up 8%, and that just takes out the benefit of the discrete tax item, so we recognized them both here.Investments in income -- as you know, our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank demand deposits and variable-rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invested primarily in high-credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.8% and an average duration currently of 3.3 years.Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.5% for the second quarter, up from 1.2% last year. We're starting to realize the benefit of gradually increasing interest rates, as I mentioned earlier. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients was relatively flat for the second quarter, primarily as the impact of wage inflation was offset by client mix.Now, let's look at our financial position. It remained strong. Cash and total corporate investments were $820 million as of November 30th, 2017. Funds held for clients as of the same date were $4.9 billion compared to $4.3 billion. Funds held for clients vary widely, as you know, and averaged $3.7 billion for the quarter. Total available-for-sale investments -- including corporate investments and funds held for clients -- reflected net unrealized losses of $14 million as of November 30th compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of May 31, and that's just a reflection of rising interest rates. Our longer-term portfolio has seen an increase in unrealized losses for this reason.Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of November 30th, 2017, reflecting $359 million in dividends paid and $94 million of shares repurchased during the first half of fiscal 2018. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a stellar 43%, and I would just point out that it was only a few years ago when return on equity was 34%, so we have really worked hard on driving that number. Our cash flows from operations were $519 for the first six months, and I would just also point out that we had a very strong cash flow quarter. The increase was 26%, although there's some timing in that that also is a function of our cash-generating power.Let's look at the guidance for 2018. It's unchanged from what we provided last quarter. This guidance, though, doesn't reflect any impact from tax reform legislation. What we tried to do in both the press release -- and, you'll hear it in a second -- is frame what we think the ongoing benefit from tax reform will be for us. I would just caveat heavily that we don't know the exact details of the legislation, and there will be regulations written that interpret the legislation that could have some impacts and changes to what we're discussing. Obviously, we are anxious to see the final bill just like everyone else is, but we recognize that it will have an important impact on us.Payroll revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 2%. Overall, we anticipate full-year growth that will be at the lower end of the range, with growth for the second half of 2018 comparable to the growth in the first half of the year. HRS revenue, by contrast, is anticipated to increase in the range of 12% to 14% for the full year, incorporating HROI. We were below the low end of the range for HRS growth in the first quarter at 7%, above the range for the second quarter at 15%, and now anticipate being above the range for the second half of the year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 6%.Interest on funds held for clients is expected to grow in the mid- to upper teens. This doesn't include the most recent increase in the Fed funds rate that was made earlier in this month, and the reason for this is it's comprehended within that range and we think by the time the increases roll through, the impact for this year will be modest. Obviously, it will be beneficial to next year, but impact at this point is going to be modest.Operating income margin is anticipated to be in the range of 39% to 40%. Effective income tax rate -- excluding any potential impact from tax reform legislation -- is expected to be in the range of 35% to 35.5%. Let me just add a note of explanation here. If you recall our guidance, when we started the year, our guidance was that our tax rate would be between 35.5% and 36%. That's what we consider our normalized tax rate currently when you don't include discrete tax benefits. The discrete tax benefits that we recognize year to date relating to stock comp expense drive that rate down, so when we say 10% to 12% benefit, we're working off of a normalized rate between 35.5% and 36%. At this point, I would anticipate that we will provide more guidance, but it could be anywhere along that spectrum. At this point, if I had to peg it, I'd say it's at the low end of the range rather than the high end.Net investment income is anticipated to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. Adjusted net income is expected to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted net income excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017 and the first half of fiscal 2018 relating to employee stock-based compensation payments. We currently don't plan any additional discrete tax benefits for the remainder of the year. We simply don't know whether we'll realize any. Please refer to our non-GAAP financial measures discussion in our press release and in our investor presentation for reconciliation of non-GAAP measure to GAAP-basis net income for the second quarter and six months of the year. GAAP-basis net income is anticipated to increase approximately 5%.Adjusted diluted earnings per share is anticipated to increase in the range of 7% to 8%, and again, we lay this out in the presentation that we posted to the website. As I've mentioned about three times now, this measure excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefits recognized.Finally, as I mentioned before, we haven't recognized any benefit of tax reform in our guidance. We anticipate it to be in the range of 10% to 12% on our annualized effective income tax rate. I mentioned how we measure that. That is before we include any discrete tax amounts for employee stock-based compensation payments. Again, one more caveat: This is based on our current understanding of the legislation. It may be subject to change upon further review of the final law and interpretive guidance that may be issued.As discussed previously -- Marty said it, and we said it in the press release -- when you have an opportunity, we expect that a portion of the benefits will be used to be reinvested in the business to drive future growth, and we will provide additional guidance in upcoming quarters. One final comment on that -- and, I suspect that this will be true for many companies -- although the statutory rate will drop to 21%, that won't be the effective rate because there will be puts and taxes in terms of benefits and deductions that are no longer allowed under the law, and that's the analysis that we're undergoing.The other thing that I would say is that we're undergoing an analysis of the opportunities that we have to reinvest some of that benefit to drive growth and efficiency and enhance our customer experience, and we're actively working on that as we speak. With all of that, I will turn it back to Marty. -- Great. Thank you, Efrain. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, you may press *1. Please unmute your phone and record your name when prompted. To cancel, you may press *2. One moment, please, for our first question. Our first question is from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question. -- Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Thanks. Just on the tax rate -- I know, Efrain, you talked about this being very preliminary at this point, but could you just walk us through where there are offsets at this point -- to your understanding -- versus that federal rate decrease? For example, are you losing the domestic production...? -- Yes, that's an important one, Danyal. There are changes in the deductibility of executive stock comp, and then there are other deductions to which we avail ourselves, so the combination of all of those will drive us up from the 21% rate. -- Got it. So, what it is that gets you from 10% to 12% -- just an understanding of -- -- Yeah, it really is an understanding of the range. There's some complexity on a number of items in the bill that we're looking at. There also may be some tax planning opportunities that we think we might be able to take advantage of, and we're in that discussion. -- Okay. And then, just to clarify, you said the low end of the range, but you're referring to that 10% to 12% -- the low end of the decrease? -- Yes, right. I said if I had to peg it, I'd peg it at 10% rather than 12%. -- Okay. And then, just one follow-up -- I know you also caveated this -- the reinvestment. Could you just talk about what that means? Is it sales, product, incremental M&A? To what extent can you quantify it all? -- I think it's all of those. We're taking a look at the opportunities. Once we have a sense of the size of this -- there's some technology -- while we're feeling good about the technology investments that we are making and the level that we're making, there are some things that are always there that we'd like to accelerate. We'd rather not mention those yet because we're going through those, and we'll want to talk to the board about them as well in an upcoming meeting this quarter, but it's a number of technology investments that could accelerate. We just think that it's a great opportunity to focus -- obviously, to take some to the bottom line, but also, to take the opportunity to invest in sustaining long-term growth, both top-line and profitability. -- Okay. Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. James Berkley of Barclays. You may now proceed. -- Thanks. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I just wanted to touch on -- did you see any potential impact from hurricanes in the quarter? If you could just size that, and if you did see an impact, are you starting to see a rebound at all, similar to what you saw with Sandy? -- I think there's been some -- not as big of a rebound as Sandy, but I don't think -- particularly when you look at Florida, while it was widespread, the damage wasn't quite as catastrophic. We're definitely seeing some small business improvement there coming back, as you'll see -- particularly in what you'd expect: Roofers, contractors, and things like that. I wouldn't say it's been significant yet, but I think it will be a smaller increase but a longer period of time because it appears that the work is going to go on for a while with the repairs. They're not as catastrophic, so you don't see a big, huge change, but you see an increased number of small businesses in those areas of improvement, and I think they'll probably hang around a little bit longer. I wouldn't say it's significant -- certainly, not making any significant change to the results. Was there something you wanted to add? -- Just that it was modest. -- Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up: Any detail around the size or timing of some of the synergies you guys are expecting or starting to see with the HROI acquisition on both revenue and cost? That would be helpful. -- One thing we are seeing is much faster than we expected by at least a quarter or so, the integration has gone extremely well. The plan was to combine a lot of the sales teams -- not all of it, but a lot of the PEO sales teams across the country -- with HROI, and we've got very experienced sales and operations teams that we have in PEO, and their leadership, and that seems to have picked up the pace of the PEO at a great time for PEO sales anyway. And so, I wouldn't say we could quantify the benefit yet, but it's certainly right at the level that we expected, and probably a little bit better from a sales and...not a profit per se, but certainly an integration and cost perspective -- both very positive in this first quarter with them. -- All right. Thanks a lot.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. You may now proceed. -- Good morning, Martin and Efrain. It's good to hear you. I wanted to start out by talking about what you're seeing in terms of midmarket sentiments. Clearly, with ACA uncertainty in calendar 2017, there were a lot of questions and stalled decision-making, which we've talked about many times. Looking forward, now that there appears to be the repeal of the individual mandate, can you talk about whether you've seen any kind of improvement in terms of clarity of decision-making or increased decision-making in the midmarket segments? -- Well, I think it's a little bit early. We're right in selling season now, and while we feel there's some momentum out there, I think that midmarket is very competitive, as it has been. There's no real change to that in the number of competitors or anything. At this stage, I don't see a lot more decision-making. As we said, we had a lot of decisions made because of ACA, and we certainly aren't seeing it back to that level, and if anything, I think it's a little slower because people made those decisions for a fully integrated HCM model that included payroll, insurance, and everything else.So, we're feeling good about selling season for midmarket, but I wouldn't say it's anything like a big pop in demand that we saw with ACA. I think ACA is still very confusing. While the individual mandate is lifted, it's not clear what the reporting requirements are going to be, and in fact, they don't seem to be -- they're not eliminated yet. There are a lot of reporting requirements that'll have to be done, so we're seeing good retention on our ACA products and some interest from new clients in still taking those products to be sure that they can monitor, record, track, and report -- or, we can report for them -- their insurance. -- Okay, fair enough. And then, if you look forward, you talked about reinvestment, you talked about potential M&A as one aspect of that reinvestment of the benefits from the tax reform. So, could you update or refresh your thoughts on overall M&A beyond the tuck-ins you've done before? Are you potentially considering something of bigger scale that would be a little bit more transformative to the business or not? -- Well, that's always a possibility. We're looking at a number of opportunities in M&A, and there's a lot of opportunity out there. Evaluations are still pretty high, so we're being very selective. I'm very proud of the fact that while we've looked at hundreds of opportunities over the years, we've picked very few and we've been very selective, which has turned out to be very good: Advance Partners, HROI just recently, SurePayroll, et cetera. So, we're going to be very selective about what we pick and the good opportunities out there. I would say that we'll look at this as an opportunity to possibly invest a little bit more. I would say transformation is always out there, but it really has to be something we're very comfortable with if that is to happen. -- Great. Thank you, and happy holidays.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. David Togut from Evercore ISI. You may now proceed.Thank you. Good morning. Marty, you talked about the beginning of the critical year-end holiday selling season -- particularly, the midmarket -- but I'm wondering if you could broaden your comments to talk about the small business payroll outsourcing and HR services market. In particular, does the passage of tax legislation -- particularly the reduction of the statutory tax rate -- impact the propensity of a small business owner to buy your services? -- It's obviously very early since it just passed, but I certainly think there is increased opportunity. Whenever there's more complication and change, there's more opportunity for them to outsource and to go to someone. Look, this is going to be a huge compliance workload in the next month to 45 days to take all the changes, the IRS getting through all this, everyone understanding it, getting back into forms, and explaining it to clients. I think that's good for us, obviously, because the more complexity from that standpoint -- typically, complexity can stop new businesses from forming. I don't see that happening here. In fact, as I think you're saying, some may be encouraged given the tax changes, and I think existing clients will find that the value of Paychex is really -- they can really see an increased value of Paychex going through all this change. So, I think there's some real opportunity there.From a selling-season perspective overall, it's pretty early. We saw some momentum in November on the small business side that we're hopeful will continue. We'll see. A lot of things are shifting. The go-to-market strategy that we've put into effect put more on the web -- making changes on our website, adding chat to our website, making it easier for clients to search Paychex, understand what Paychex is, and then buy either online or through telesales -- it looks like it's starting to pick up, but it's early, David. We'll have to get to the end of January to really see what the big impact is on small business. By the way, HR services -- as we've noted, and you've seen -- is growing very strong. It's a very strong market for PEO, retirement services, and time and attendance, for example. They're all growing well.Understood. And then, I'm curious if you saw anything during ADP's proxy fight with Pershing Square, particularly their greater disclosure about their innovation strategy with their new intended back-end payroll engine and tax-filing engine -- whether any of that disclosure impacts the way you think about your own innovation path, particularly given the excess cash you'll have under the new tax bill. -- No, I don't think so. ADP has always been a good competitor. I think we feel very comfortable with the technology investments that we've made in Flex, and we just introduced our new product bundles in October -- our Express Payroll product on the low end, SurePayroll's investment... No, I think we feel good about the investments, but there are always some things that you'd like to do a little bit more in a quicker period of time, and that's really -- from a technology side, we're reviewing whether we can do that. It really hasn't been influenced by ADP. They continue to be a good competitor, and we feel very comfortable competing against them.Thanks. Just a quick final one from me: As you contemplate the use of proceeds from the tax cut, you particularly mentioned higher R&D, but what about dividend payout? You have a terrific payout ratio of around 80%. Should we expect accelerating dividend growth once the tax cuts come through, and would the payout ratios stay at approximately the same level? -- Obviously, that's a board decision, so as we approach the next board meeting in the next month, that'll be a good discussion to have. I think the board has been very consistent with paying out a generous dividend compared to others, but with how big of a change this is, I think they'll continue to evaluate whether that's the proper level, but I don't have any doubt that we'll continue to be a leader in the way we payout, and it'll certainly be consistent with what we've done in the past.Understood. Thanks, and happy holidays.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Brian Keane of Deutsche Bank. You may now proceed. -- Hi, guys. I just want to ask about payroll services growth. Efrain, I think you suggested that the growth would be toward the lower end of the range. I'm just trying to think a little bit about the causes of that. I think you did mention client mix, so I just want to make sure I understand it. -- Brian, I think the two biggest impacts to that -- and then, there's one additional factor that could impact it in the back half of the year, but if I go through the first six months of the year, what you're seeing are the impacts of going from an average client size in the upper 16s to about 16, and we disclosed that, so we got that drag in the first half of the year, and that's impacting us. On the pricing side, our range is about 2 to 4, and we're netting around that 2% range, so the combination of those two is driving us to where we are. In the back half of the year, the wildcard will be how strong the selling season is. If we have a strong selling season, we could start to build up from that number, and we are anticipating and hoping that we will. -- So, as client size gets smaller, then the revenue yield is lower? -- Yes. -- Okay. And then, just my question on the tax reform: So, it sounds like you're suggesting that some of that benefit might get reinvested, so it would potentially go into investments, which would lower margins, and therefore, we wouldn't see the full 100 percent impact to the bottom line. I just want to make sure I got that correct. -- Yeah, let me add some nuance to that, Brian. The concept here is not that we simply reinvest and up the amount of expense, as we have in the business. The idea is that we reinvest over a period of time -- say, over the next couple of years -- and that those investments pay out in future growth in the company in two forms: 1). Top-line growth, and 2). Earnings growth by becoming more effective and efficient. That's our thought process here -- not that we think the current rate of spend needs to be upped and that we have an opportunity, but that we have -- as Marty suggested earlier -- the opportunity to look at a range of different projects both on the operations side and on the technology side to see if we can accelerate them, and if they were on a roadmap that was three to four years, could we do that in two, and can we start to pull some of those projects forward? We have a robust list of things that we are looking at. -- Okay, very helpful. Happy holidays, guys.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mr. Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. You may now proceed. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. I'll start by following up on this client mix shift. So, in your 10-K for fiscal '17, you said total payroll clients was flat at 605,000, so if the mix is -- does this mean the midmarket clients or larger clients actually declined, but it was offset by growth in smaller clients? -- No, Gary. I think that the growth that we saw was on the lower end of our client base. We didn't see a decline in the midmarket in terms of the number of clients, but as a percentage of the client base because the rest of the client base shifted down to lower-sized clients. Over the last couple of years, we've been seeing more growth on the low end of the client base than on the higher end of the client base. -- So, let me ask about that metric -- that 605,000. I know that's rounded, but the number you put in the 10-K every year -- is that just payroll, so is the number bigger if you have some segment that's doing HRS, but not buying payroll? -- No, that includes clients that run payroll. That would capture -- so, some of those clients have additional ancillaries, but we'd count them if they were payroll clients. -- Right, OK. And so, the next question -- continuing on the theme -- so, you've talked about the new bundles, the simpler pricing, and adding some things there. I know it's early, but how is that being received in the market as your people are headed out at key selling season? Is that helping competitively? Is there any feedback you have at this point? -- Yeah, Gary. It's positive feedback from a couple of different standpoints. One is the bundles being a little more competitive by adding things that other competitors don't have, like paperless onboarding -- the two midlevel bundles have paperless onboarding -- and this new do-it-yourself handbook. We've always had a handbook product, but it's very extensive, so we give information to the client and we work with them personally over the phone or in person to put that together.We found that the new do-it-yourself online handbook that is a little more simple and more self-directed by the client is getting very good feedback in that bundle. And then, on the low end, Express is getting good feedback. So far, it's good feedback. It's early in selling season. You can't really see it until January -- particularly in small business -- and it's harder to predict, but we're getting positive feedback on it from what's in the bundle. We think we hit it right, so we'll see how the selling season comes out. -- Okay, great. And then, just a final one from me: In your remarks, each of you alluded to PEO and ASO being poised for some acceleration over time. Was that comment aimed at the comment you made about integrating the sales force of HROI with your own and that going well, or was there some other reason that you're optimistic about the positioning of the combined business there? -- I'd say both. 1). The integration is going very well, so we added good leadership at HROI and their experience with a very experienced team on the Paychex side across the country. So, I think that's been positive, and I think it's helping the growth in PEO, but overall, I would say that right now, PEO and HR outsourcing are doing well in general. I think it's just because of all the changing regulations, and it's been very positive from that standpoint. When you think about it -- just think about minimum wage changes and how many are in different states.What we're finding -- and, I mentioned this before -- even before tax reform changes, what these businesses are going through now was the fact that while federal regulations are trying to be reduced -- and are being reduced to some degree -- state regulations are making it even more complex if you're a multistate employer. Different minimum wage changes, Paid Family Leave Act is different in New York than in New Jersey and other states, and now, a lot of rules are even coming out on scheduling employees. So, I think it's just that a shared employer is getting a lot of attention right now. -- That makes sense, thanks. Happy holidays and merry Christmas.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. You may now proceed. -- Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Marty, as you look at the selling season and compare it to what you've seen in the last couple of years and the changes that are going on -- more people that are going to the internet to look for payroll -- has that at all changed how you're managing the sales process and what you're investing in? Ultimately, could some of the investments you're talking about as a result of tax reform be related to that? -- Certainly, and we've already started those investments. Kartik, we've talked about how we've really upped the investment in digital marketing and getting more leads. We've invested in the website. We've now rolled out different forms of live chat on the website. Definitely, what you're saying -- small business -- micro in particular, fewer than five employees -- they're 60 percent of the way through the sales process just in the search online by themselves, and they're ready to buy, so the change that we made at the beginning of this fiscal year where we added more sales reps in the virtual teams or telesales has really started to pay off. We're learning and tweaking on the leads, and how to get more leads, and how to do it in the most efficient way, but that certainly could be part of the investment.Now, if you go back to what Efrain said on top of that -- to be clear, this is not just about saying, ""Okay, we're going to raise the level of ongoing expense."" We're looking for some technology investments that could be made over this or the next fiscal year, that while we're getting the biggest benefit of tax reform, we could accelerate those investments to maybe speed that up. We're feeling pretty good -- again, on selling season, I won't comment because it's too early, particularly for small businesses, but we're very bullish on how virtual sales are going to take off. The field also gets very focused on the five-plus and larger clients and has more time for that. When clients want to call in and buy, telesales is ready to do it. -- Marty, in the past, you've focused on acquiring companies that are private and bolting on those companies. As you look at this tax reform, do you think there's any change in valuation? I know valuation has kept you on the sidelines, but do you think there's any change in valuation because of tax reform? Could that have any impact on what you look at or what happens to valuations? -- I suppose. It certainly depends on the company and their profitability. With many of these companies, it depends on their size and profitability whether the tax reform will even impact them or not, or whether they have carry losses, forwards, and things like that. So, I think it could have some impact. I don't think we're seeing that right now, but that certainly would measure into things that we're looking at. -- The other thing I'd add, Kartik, is that the inability to deduct interest expense above certain caps makes certain targets more attractive than they otherwise would be at the margin. Now, I just want to caveat that I am not saying that we have a target in mind, but that those opportunities will be there. It's not a great place to be if you have a significant amount of debt in your capital structure, and companies like Paychex that don't operate that way can bring value in those situations. So, I would say at the margin, those opportunities will be more attractive. -- Efrain, just one last question: The interest on client funds -- does the rate change and/or the tax reform at all change how you will invest these funds? -- Yeah, it actually could have an impact. We were reticent -- we had an internal discussion about attempting to modify guidance with all of these changes going on, but it certainly could impact the composition of the portfolio, which could, in turn, impact the effective tax rate. The point I'm making is that you may end up in a world where corporate taxable bonds are more favorable investment vehicles, which would drive your effective tax rate up but won't have much of a change on the bottom line. We're looking at the composition of the portfolio to understand if it makes sense over time to change the ship from almost all municipals and some corporates to more corporates and fewer municipals. So, that's all part of the raft of considerations that we need to think about. -- All right. Thank you, Marty and Efrain.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. You may now proceed. -- Thank you. Good morning, Martin. Good morning, Efrain. I wanted to go once more to the derivative impact of tax reform. You addressed that the propensity to outsource might go up because these things are complex, but what are your SME clients saying to you about potential higher employment and things like that? Down the road, can that affect that client mix metric that's hurting payroll? -- Frankly, at this point, they're not saying anything because I think they're still trying to figure it all out, but I think that they will certainly -- to the degree that a small business gains a benefit on tax reform -- many small businesses aren't that profitable, so they might not pick up that much gain, but I think the overall feeling is they'll have an opportunity to invest in their business, hire more people, and they'll do it in that way so that they can expand.So, that certainly should be another positive opportunity for us to -- even existing clients will be able to add more employees, which will help us with more checks, and they may now say, ""Okay, I can spend on a 401(k) and make a contribution, so I'll take a 401(k),"" and we're looking at all of our marketing to our clients and prospects to say, ""Hey, this may be the time that you want to invest in health insurance, 401(k), retirement plans, an IRA, or something else that Paychex can provide to you,"" and make it easy for them as they see their benefit. -- To build on what Marty said, our thinking as we go forward is that the tilt in the future will be toward comprehensive outsourcing solutions -- bundling benefits, bundling other ancillaries. If there was a trend to do that in the past, there's more now, and we think we have shown by our investment dollars that we think PEO is going to be a beneficiary, but to Marty's point, we think there are going to be other areas of the business on the ancillary side that will benefit from more available cash in the hands of small- to medium-sized businesses. -- Understood. For the near term, is it possible to quantify -- or, have you put in your forward expectations -- the strength of any one-time reporting related to this complexity in the next one or two quarters? -- I think it's early, and I think where you would see it and where it would be easier to do is on the PEO side more than anything else. But, I think we're early in the process to see what's going on. -- Got it. One more along those lines -- lower withholding because of this affected investment plan? -- We think the impact will be between $200 million to $300 million on client funds. At the margin, we think that's about $0.01 EPS going forward -- I'm sorry, on an annualized basis. I don't want to cause an estimate revision at this point. This is yet another -- Kartik asked earlier about the portfolio of client funds. It will decline as a result of this. It's a modest impact given the portfolio, but it will have an impact, and we're rolling through all of those impacts to be able to speak with more certainty as we go forward. -- Got it. One question not related to any of this: The cash flow for the last six months has been quite good. How much of that is timing, and is it sustainable for the course of the year? -- Yeah, I think 26% was high. I don't have an exact percentage. Obviously, 26% through the first half of the year -- there were some unique items that occurred. The fourth quarter was artificially low, and the first six months were probably artificially high, but I think double-digit is certainly where we're going. I'd just add one other point on that: Our cash generation has been tremendously strong, so we continue to deliver high-quality earnings. -- Got it. Thanks, and happy holidays, both of you.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. You may now proceed. -- Good morning. How are you? Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one -- again, following on the tax reform theme -- you guys are talking about reinvesting. I assume some of your competitors are probably looking at similar things. In terms of overall market competition and what you see, what impact do you think you could see from tax reform on the competitiveness of the market? -- I'd say this, Rick, and Marty can build on it. If you've got more in your war chest, you're in a better position, so I would say those who have more in the war chest are in a better position to be able to compete in a landscape where resources matter. I would say we're -- that's one reason why, as we looked at the opportunity, we said there are opportunities to accelerate some high-value projects, and that it's time to start to think about doing that over the next couple years. -- As Efrain said, it's an interesting point when you think about how there are companies that are going to gain from this in our competitive environment and there are others that won't because they don't have the profitability and the tax reduction that we're going to have. We'll be able to invest more where others aren't going to gain that much. I think it'll continue to put companies who are already profitable and who have been paying a high tax and will now pay lower -- that should help us -- if we plan this right and invest correctly, this will make us even more competitive than we are today, with some others who can't do the same level of increased investment. -- Thanks. That's helpful. Building on that a little bit, I have two questions on CapEx. I noticed it was a little bit higher this quarter. Based on your disclosure, I think it's due to the campus buildout. -- Yeah, the campus buildout. Look on the presentation we posted on the website. I think we said CapEx is going to be $180 million to $190 million for the year. I think it's going to come in a little bit lower. You can see what we spent in the quarter on the campus. One thing that I think is very important to emphasize -- I keep saying this -- the buildout of the campus permits us to consolidate leases and save expenses on an operating basis going forward, so that's why we did it -- no reason other than that. Efficiency -- from a financial standpoint, it was a very attractive deal for us. -- Is the campus buildout primarily going to happen this year? Thinking about CapEx and the investments you guys have talked about, how should we think about some of those investments on the technology and CapEx side going forward? -- It's primarily this year, Rick. We may have some spillover capital into next year, but most of it occurs this year. -- And, in the longer term, with you accelerating some investments, should we look for that CapEx number to drift up slightly in the coming year? -- It could. If you look at what we've been spending, we're somewhere in that 3.5%-of-revenue range. Sometimes, we bounce up a little closer to 4%. That's our normalized CapEx -- sorry, capital expense amount. We could bounce a little higher if we saw projects that made sense. It's not going to -- I wouldn't anticipate at this point that it would bounce up to the level that we're spending this year because of the building. -- Great. Thank you very much. Happy holidays.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may now proceed. -- Great. How are you guys doing? -- Good, thanks. -- Good. Just one more on tax. I just wanted to push a little bit on the reinvestments. I know it's premature to have precise numbers as far as how much you may reinvest, but can you just roughly dimension it for us? Are we talking about 10% of the benefit, 40%...? Just some rough order of magnitude to give investors a sense of how you guys are thinking about the reinvestment opportunities. -- Jason, this is about as precise as I can be: I would say it's half or less. -- Okay, I'll take it. Thanks. -- The reason why -- I don't mean to be flippant, and that wasn't a flippant comment. It is actually a serious comment. The process when you're doing this is that you collect a lot of opportunities, and Marty and the management team will sit down and say, ""What do we think are things that we think will really move the needle as opposed to just being opportunities to spend and give us a bit of an incremental bump?""And then, we're going to go through a conversation at the board level to discuss what their comfort level is, and then we're going to look at it all together, and does it make sense from both an investor standpoint and from a business standpoint? And so, we're in Inning 1.5 to 2 of that process. It will certainly accelerate over the next month or so, but it is a little bit early. We know the opportunities there. We certainly wouldn't drop all of it into the opportunities, but we think we do have opportunities to spend, and we're going to rank and order them, and then do that. -- All right. So, you think that by the time of the next earnings call, we'll have -- -- Oh, yeah, definitely. -- Yes. -- Okay, great. I don't think I heard much about bookings and retention in the quarter, at least qualitatively. I know you don't give hard numbers, but you were facing some easier comparisons. I know you were targeting bookings to be positive on a full year-over-year basis for '18. Is that still on track, and are you seeing further upticks in retention after the implementation of a new client service model? -- I think retention has been very consistent through the years, so I think that's been positive. It's near all-time highs, and we're rebounding back from last year where we dropped off just a little bit, so I think it's been pretty consistent and positive there, and again, we'll have the best sense after January. It's certainly the same for sales. Jason, we don't normally talk about it until after we get through the selling season, but we had some momentum in November, and it's always hard to tell exactly, but we're feeling pretty good about it, and we'll see how we come out with the new bundles, with the service model changed and with the go-to-market stuff that we've done with the virtual team inside and the increase in web investment. We're feeling good; it's just early and a little tough to talk about until we know. -- Okay. And just a last one: On core payroll, we have a slight tweak here to the low end of 1% to 2% for the year, so around the edges, what changed in your mind over the last three months? It doesn't sound like the hurricane impacts were any worse than you had feared, and I think we had talked about the smaller client sizes last quarter, but I just wanted to see if there was anything discernible that led you to the lower end. -- Beyond the things that I mentioned, the speed and the pace of ramp always impacts payroll revenue growth. We tweaked it based on what we're seeing in terms of the pace of the ramp through the year. I think that's the reason we tweaked at this point. -- Just the ramp of the metric itself, you mean? In other words, now you're taking a checkpoint halfway through the year and just feel like the low end is more likely? -- Yes. -- Got it. All right. Have a great holiday. Thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Tim McHugh of the William Blair Company. You may now proceed. -- Yes, thanks. Just to follow up -- the comments you referenced once or twice on November -- is that related to macro data or your company-specific comment? If it's company-specific, can you elaborate on what the momentum was that you're referring to that makes you feel better? -- Yeah. Just generally, you're starting to head into that selling season, and we had some momentum there -- that was specific to us, Tim, not in the macro sense. As you're getting into this year-end time, we felt pretty good about -- the first part of the second quarter was kind of like the first quarter, and November seemed to have a little bit of an uptick, but that doesn't make the selling season, so we hate to comment much more than that. We just feel pretty good, and particularly, if you look at the HRS side of it, we certainly saw a nice uptick in the PEO side. So, I'm feeling pretty positive coming out of November, but again, I could tell you a lot more after this next quarter. -- Okay. One other question: HROI -- when I do the math on the revenue, contribution, and expense impact, it looks like it broke even, maybe even slightly worse than that. -- Yeah, it was modestly negative, Tim, but really not a significant impact. -- Why? Was that integration expense? -- You always have integration costs. When we do a deal, we're assuming that we've got to do a number of investments, and then there's the amortization associated with the deal itself that adds to expense, and that starts to lessen as we go through the quarter. -- Okay, thanks.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. David Grossman of Stifel Financials. You may now proceed. -- Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if I could just go back to the unit growth question for the things coming up in terms of the impact of mix on that number. My recollection is that as a typical economic cycle matures, you have a tendency to be adding new business creations and improvements, and our mix naturally skews toward smaller clients or companies than the average. That's a natural phenomenon, so that's pressuring payroll growth to the lower end. Are there other dynamics that are at work that drive that number down? Typically, you would get volume in terms of total units that would offset that decline, and I'm wondering if this cycle is different or if there's anything else going on in the business that may be impacting that growth for that number. -- David, I think it really boils down -- you can summarize it by saying that last year, we didn't have client growth. We talked a bit about why that was at the end of the year. A lot of that related to service disruptions and the spike in attrition that we had. We dropped by a point. When you put that together with the sales result and the mix shift that we're seeing, you're driving payroll service revenue to the rate that we're experiencing. So, I think what's a little idiosyncratic now is that we're anniversaring some of that retention issue that we had last year, and it's driving payroll service revenue down. -- Right. So, I guess this question was asked in a different context: The difference -- since we knew about the retention and the headwind that we would have going into this year, is the difference primarily related to a pricing dynamic, then? What is it that specifically is -- -- No, it's not a pricing dynamic. I would say at the margin, pricing is a little bit more competitive in small-market payroll under 50 than it was last year, so we're realizing about 2%. But again, I'm comparing growth against last year, where I started to experience some of these effects in the back half of that year, so the front half is a little more challenged than the back half will be. -- Got it. Okay. And then, the second question I had relates to the TEO. When you back out the distortion from HROI, can you give us a sense of how the worksite employees growth is organically trending? -- I don't know that I've got the exact number. We haven't disclosed it. But, I would say this, David: It's pretty solid. It's certainly upper single digits, and maybe double digits. I'd have to go back, but I would say that's the range. I won't be more specific than that, but if I can think about the point behind your question, we've obviously had very good worksite employee growth, but it's not all because of HROI. We've had worksite employee growth on our PEO, also. -- Yeah, I'd say it's been pretty consistent. We went over 1 million worksite employees that we serve, and that was before HROI, so I think those numbers are in that range. That's the range. -- Got it. Any thoughts at a high level on how passthroughs are impacting revenues this year? Is there any notable difference in terms of insurance passthroughs in terms of how they're impacting revenue growth in that segment? -- Not really, David. I think there's a little bit more impact -- by the way, I just looked it up, so the best that I will say on it is that our organic worksite employee growth was double digits, so we're seeing nice performance. Marty alluded to that. I didn't have the number in front of me, but I looked it up. So, passthroughs are not -- I should say that at the margin, there is more passthrough because of the addition of HROI. It's not significantly distorting the growth numbers. I would say that as the percentage of business that we're deriving from PEO growth, you'll see more. One other thing I would say -- and, I'll take it under advisement as to whether we report it more regularly and do that every single year in our 10-K passthrough, so we'll look at whether we add that disclosure, so you get a sense of what that is. -- Right. And, one last thing on the PEO -- you made this acquisition. I don't remember what your historical exposure was to the blue-gray segments, so I'm just curious -- you made this acquisition. How do you see the market evolving over the next couple of years vis-à-vis what your historical perspective was two or three years prior to this? -- Do you mean general, for the PEO? -- Yeah. -- I think we're still looking at it consistently, as we always have. That's one of the things we liked about HROI, that they were very consistent with the way they went after clients and selected clients. We had a very good compliance way to look at it, and underwriting. I think they were very consistent as well, so I don't think we're increasing risk as we take on these PEOs and as we take on a company like HROI because they're very consistent with the way we looked at it, and I don't see us getting more risky. We don't see it that way. We've always been pretty careful on that and have had a very strong PEO because of that. So, we've had the growth without taking on additional risk over the parameters that we've always had in the past. -- We also think that segment of the market will continue to grow, and particularly grow in areas where HROI is strong and we're strong. -- Right. Okay, guys. Thanks very much. Have a great holiday.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon of Baird. You may now proceed, sir. -- Hi, Marty and Efrain. With regard to HROI, was the contribution this past quarter somewhere around $20 million? -- I think you can derive that, Mark. It's in that range. -- Okay. And then, with regard to the effective yield for the back half of this year given the recent rate increase, how should we think about that in terms of -- we'll think about the float balance coming down by 200 to 300 -- -- But, that won't be in the back half of the year, Mark. I'd just caution you to -- -- Yeah, I know, with the duration and everything. That's why I was asking the question. -- No, I think we still feel comfortable with the guidance that we've given, so that's where we peg it at. The reason why I can't be more specific than that is that we're looking at the composition of the portfolio, and over the next three to five months, it could change, but we're comfortable with where we are right now. -- Okay. And then, with regard to the small business formations, there's been a lot of discussion about the way passthroughs are going to work. Wouldn't you think that there's going to ultimately end up being a little bit more in terms of small business formations that could end up occurring because of this change, and if so, how would you take advantage of that? -- Well, I do think that you would expect that given the reform that you're seeing, and that that would drive some of that. I obviously haven't seen it yet, but you certainly get that feeling that that'll happen. We would take advantage of it by being out there and marketing to the fact that if you're going to incorporate as a small business for the first time in particular, you would best have someone like Paychex there to support you. So, we're already looking at how marketing can take advantage of anything that comes out of tax reform, and that is certainly one of them. -- Great. And, with regard to the capital expensing provisions and the ability to deduct all of that related to the next five years, to what extent would you end up really taking advantage of that? Are there ways to take advantage of it to a greater extent than just marginally increasing your CapEx? -- There may be, Mark, and I would just say it's early in the process, so we're going to take a look at that. -- Okay. In terms of these very short-term, one-time impacts, to what extent are you going to have to spend more in the very short term just to get the systems into compliance? It sounds like the IRS is basically not going to give the new withholding tables until February, so it's going to be a bit of a scramble here in terms of calendar Q1. -- Yeah, I don't think -- we're already working with the IRS almost daily on what's happening and how we'll be able to support them, and that's the strength of a company of our size, and our compliance team and tax team -- they're ready, they know it's going to be a scramble, they're expecting it, and we work very closely with the IRS to help them and work with them so that everything is up and running as quickly as possible. It's not going to cost us additional expense in the quarter or something like that. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of extra work, but our teams will be ready to do it. I don't see any big investment or change because of it. -- Okay, great. Anything to think about with regard to your deferred income tax liability? -- Yes. There will be a revow, and it will produce a benefit, and we're working through that. -- Okay. Obviously, everybody will know to look through it, but I just brought it up. -- No, I know. I appreciate it, Mark. But, yes, we're not ready to quantify it yet, but there will be some one-time benefits. -- Okay, great. Happy, happy holidays.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Jeff Silber of BMO. You may now proceed. -- Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. It's actually Henry Chien. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask a more high-level competitive positioning question. There does seem to be a ton of investment going into the HR services and HR bundles from both ADP and software providers. I was just wondering if you could share any updated thoughts on how Paychex is doing this season in terms of HR sales, and where Paychex is doing better, or how you're thinking about positioning in general. -- Henry, I think the competitive environment is pretty much the same. Everybody's investing. We feel very good about the investments we've made. In fact, we've really taken it to -- we've taken our entire development team a year or more ago to agile teams. We develop and roll out changes much faster now.We rolled out the new bundles in October that include -- so, it's not just payroll bundles. They're bundles with HR components to them like paperless onboarding for our clients so that you can basically post, recruit, hire, and bring them on, all in a paperless fashion as part as one of our bundles that they can by, or make a do-it-yourself handbook, because we've found that instead of the more complicated handbook and thorough handbook that needs personal interaction, more clients want to do it themselves and have a scaled-down one that they can complete at their own pace when they want to do it.All that innovation has been quick, and rolls out, and rolls out very successfully, and we haven't even talked on the call at all about mobile. Our mobile adoption and the use of our mobile app has picked up dramatically, and it's been more by the employees of the clients versus the employers. So, these innovations have been very good. We see tax reform as an opportunity -- as we've said a number of times -- to possibly accelerate a few things that are on the outskirts of what we've wanted to do and bring them forward a little bit, but we're very comfortable with our level of innovation and competitiveness in the market, and I think it's been pretty consistent. You've got to innovate, you've got to have great service, you've got to deliver, and I think Paychex and our folks are doing that. -- Okay, that's great. And, just in terms of the kind of macro environment, it's sounding like the smaller client sizes and the number of business formations have been picking up from your view. Is that a normal pattern that you've seen from your experience over cycles, and is there anything that we should watch out for or that you're watching out for to be careful of in terms of the micro employment? -- We haven't talked too much about the formation itself, but it's flattened out. It's pretty close to the levels it was pre-recession. I think the big thing after this recession was how long it took. It didn't pop right back. It took a lot longer, but it was sustained longer. The thing I mentioned earlier was that in our monthly employment report, what we're seeing is that small business job growth -- under 50 employees -- has moderated, but there's still job growth and consistent job growth, but it moderated down, as you'd expect since we're around full employment. But, the wage increases are now picking up, and part of that is scarcity of the resource because of full employment, so the wage increases are now getting up from that 2%, getting closer to 3%, and running around 2.8% or so.So, you're seeing a pretty good wage increase, and then you're seeing the moderate small business job growth -- that's all pretty positive. The thing to look out for may be what was mentioned a couple of questions ago, which is with the passthroughs and the tax reform, does that generate new business formation for someone who was not going to formulate a business before? Now, it may make sense for them. We may see a pickup in that. It's just a little bit early to tell. -- Okay. Thanks so much for the color.Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Mr. Tian-Chen Wong of JP Morgan. You may now proceed. -- Real quick, I wanted to clarify on the pricing side. With all the bundling and pricing simplifications, any change in pricing in the quarter and your outlook? I didn't think so, but I just wanted to make sure. -- No. Really, the bundles were more combining the features, making the pricing simpler in the way that we presented to the client. We don't see that as changing the revenue per client or what we're getting from them in price. We haven't seen it yet -- it's early. We didn't expect it and haven't seen it yet. -- All right, that's great. Thank you. Have a safe holiday. -- Any more calls?At this time, there are no further questions on queue. -- Great. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for about 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in the second-quarter press release conference call and your interest in Paychex. We appreciate it. Please have a great holiday.

n Dec 12, we issued an updated research report on  .  .Strong domain expertise in human capital management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services has been a key growth factor for the company. This has increased the company's clientele and driven revenues northward. Notably, the company's top line is expected to witness a 5-year (2012-2017) CAGR of 7.2%.Paychex stock has gained 14.0% year to date, outperforming the 11.3% rally of the  it belongs to.However we are apprehensive about a declining rate of client retention over the last few quarters, which might affect the company's performance in the near term.Paychex's investments in product development, technology and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are tailwinds. Further, product launches and joint venture initiatives are likely to drive long-term growth. Also, its continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.Notably, the company's initiatives to enrich its product portfolio via acquisitions have also proved beneficial. With 14 acquisitions since its inception, Paychex has significantly improved its solutions suite and total addressable market (TAM). These have also acted as revenue boosters. | Moreover, the growth potential of the industry that Paychex caters to is high. Per the company, half of its total addressable market is still untapped.However, the company is facing problems in retaining its customer base for the last few quarters, which is a major concern. During the last quarter, the company's payroll client base remained flat due to a challenging demand environment and modest decline in retention. The client base was adversely affected by political uncertainty, which in turn impacted outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market.Additionally, increasing competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity  is another key concern.Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A top-ranked stock worth considering in the sector is Intel Corporation  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term expected EPS growth rate for Intel is projected to be 8.42%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

"ith a government shutdown averted (for now), the big story on Friday was the Government Employment Situation report...and it didn't disappoint. The economy added 228,000 jobs in November, which surged past expectations and salvaged weekly gains for two of the major indices.The S&P had another positive session with a rise of 0.55% to 2651.5, marking a weekly advance of more than 0.3%.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.00), with the stock changing hands as low as $65.89 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Paychex Inc, looking at the history chart for PAYX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, PAYX makes up 4.27% of the First Trust RBA Quality Income ETF (Symbol: QINC) which is trading lower by about 0.2% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@PAYX Dividend Yield Pushes Past 3%@2017-12-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/payx-dividend-yield-pushes-past-3-2017-12-01

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 4.1% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Paychex commenced fiscal 2018 on an impressive note, reporting solid results for the fiscal first quarter, wherein the top and bottom lines, both, came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company registered year-over year improvement on both the counts.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and grew 11% year over year. The upside mainly stemmed from higher revenues and efficient cost management.Paychex reported total revenues (including interest on funds held for clients) of $816.8 million, up 4% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) ascended 4% year over year to $803.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $816 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2% from the year-ago period to $457.8 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check and client base.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 7% year over year to $345.3 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base and worksite employees, elevated revenues from retirement, as well as online HR administration services. The growth was partially offset by tough comparisons wherein the segment's revenues benefited from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to $13.7 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses flared up 2% from the year-ago tally to $471.8 million due to increased investments in technology and PEO business. Acquisition related expenses also contributed to this increase. However, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, contracted 110 basis points (bps) to 57.8%.The company's operating income grew 7% year over year to $345 million. In addition, Paychex's operating margin expanded 110 bps to 42.2%, chiefly driven by lower total expenses as a percentage of revenues.Net income came in at $227.8 million, up from $217.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Paychex exited the fiscal first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $368.2 million compared with $323.4 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. It generated operating cash flow of $343.6 million during the reported quarter.During the quarter, Paychex paid $179.1 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth $94.1 million.Buoyed by splendid fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised its revenues outlook. The company now anticipates total revenues to jump 6%, up from the previous estimate of 5%. This translates to revenues of $3.34 billion, which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.31 billion.Human Resource Services revenues are now projected to grow in the range of 12-14%, up from 8-10% projected earlier.Apart from this, the company revised its guidance for operating margin and effective tax rate. Operating margin is anticipated to be between 39% and 40% compared with the previous guidance of approximately 40%. Effective income tax rate is now projected to be in the band of 35-35.5%, down from the previous estimate of 35.5-36%.All other guidance provided during fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results remained unchanged. Management expects Payroll Service revenues to climb year over year in the range of 1-2%, while Interest on funds held for clients and investment income is expected to grow in the mid-to-upper-teen range.Net income is still likely to advance 5% year over year on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to be up in the range of 7-8%, which comes to $2.35-$2.38. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.37.Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downward momentum. There has been one move higher compared to eight lower two months ago. | At this time, Paychex's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than momentum investors.While estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, the magnitude of these revisions have been net zero. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We are expecting an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $100 million. The year-over-over increase can be attributedto the addition of new clients, new business wins and product development initiatives.Moreover, revenues were impacted positively by 31.2% increase in recurring revenues and approximately 21.9% increase in implementation and other revenues on a year-over-year basis.The company's adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 84%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Paycom Software's adjusted EBITDA increased 69% year over year to $30.7 million. Adjusted operating margins during the quarter came in 30.3% as compared with 23.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenues, total administration expenses decreased to 58.5% during the quarter from 63.5% reported in the year-ago period.Non-GAAP net income came in at $16.9 million compared with $8.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Paycom Software exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $66.6 million compared with $68.1 million in the previous quarter. Receivables were $1.4 million as compared with $1.8 million reported in the previous quarter.The company's balance sheet comprises long-term debt of $33.2 million compared with $33.5 million reported in the previous quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA is now anticipated to be approximately in a range of $131-$133 million (previously $122.5-$124.5 million).Paycom Software reported stellar third-quarter 2016 results and provided modest fourth-quarter guidance. The company also updated fiscal 2017 revenue guidance. Also, both the top line and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives.We believe that the higher adoption of Paycom Software's Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind in the long run. Further, the company might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which will boost revenues, going forward.Nevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation  , Intuit Inc.  and Paychex, Inc.  remains a headwind.Currently, Paycom Software carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

DP has recently  , the company offering pay cards and other electronic payment accounts, thereby allowing employers the option to pay their employees with cards instead of paper paychecks or electronic deposits. The pay cards are currently the most rapidly growing form of payment and a significant driver to this growth is the rise of the gig economy (more short-term positions and independent contractors). Pay card transactions allow independent freelancers to consolidate all their income and expenses in a single account. Not only does it help the employees, but also from an employer's standpoint, digital payments are cost effective, more secure, and immediate.The value of Form 1099 transactions is expected to be somewhere between  . Currently around 73% of the companies still take the help of manual tools to manage their Form 1099 workforce. Hence, the scope is huge if these employers adapt to the pay card method considering their efficiency and convenience. Secondly, for around 24.5 million 'under banked' U.S. households, digital accounts will be a desirable option. The efficiency and ease of use of pay cards already make them a popular choice for the Millennials and Gen Z population.This acquisition has given ADP its own proprietary digital payments processing platform, thereby making it the only human capital management provider with such an option. After the completion of its integration, ADP will be able to manage over 4 million accounts on a single platform. Currently, ADP's existing 700,000 clients will enjoy its flexible payment options which will be extended to new clients too, in the near future.While ADP's PEO services business has driven much of the top line growth in the last few years, payroll processing continues to be its core business, contributing the largest portion of its top-line. The company's revenue from its payroll processing services have grown at a steady rate of 5% annually over the last five years, driven by stable growth in the number of clients served by the company, and an annual rise in client fees. Although the share of the division in terms of ADP's total revenue has dropped from 75% in 2012 to about 69% in 2017, it accounts for  , according to our estimates.With the acquisition of companies such as Global Cash Cards, ADP might attract more clients for its payroll processing business.

DP (  ) is slated to release its Q1 fiscal 2018 results on November 2nd. In fiscal 2017, the  in line with guidance and market expectations, and the trend is expected to continue in this fiscal as well. The main driver for its revenues last fiscal were its PEO services, the division which has witnessed a consistent growth of around 12%-13% in each of the last few years. While ADP's PEO services business has driven much of the top line growth, payroll processing continues to be its core business, contributing to the largest portion of its top-line. Going forward, ADP expects its revenues to grow at a steady rate of 5%-6%, and its adjusted diluted EPS to improve by 2%-4%.We have a  , which is around 9% below the current stock price.ADP's revenue from its PEO services have grown at around 14.5% annually over the last five years. As the popularity among businesses to outsource their HR services keep rising, this figure might grow even further in the future. The  for HR outsourcing is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (  ) of around  and that will provide a major boost to ADP's PEO services growth.However, the total revenue growth rate for the company is not being able to keep pace with the PEO revenue growth. During the last five years, ADP's overall revenue has increased at a rate of roughly 7% annually. This is resulting in a greater contribution by the PEO services to the company's overall revenues. As a result, the proportion of PEO services in the company's total revenue has grown from 20% in 2012 to almost 28% in 2017.One of the important drivers for the growth in ADP's client base has been brought about by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The adoption of ADP's products has been increasing significantly post the Act, especially since larger employers (+1,000 employees) find it easier to outsource the job to a third party who can help them implement ACA solutions for their employees. Consequently, the significant growth in the rise of demand for its PEO services has led to a 9% annual rise in its worksite employees over the last couple of years. Based on the company guidance, we expect ADP's PEO services revenue to grow by 11% to 13% in the current fiscal year.The two main drivers for its payroll processing services has been a stable growth in the number of clients served by the company, and an annual rise in client fees. The company's revenue from this segment has grown at a steady rate of 5% annually over the last five years and accounts for almost 65% of the company's total valuation, according to our estimates. However, it is noteworthy to mention that this segment's contribution to the company's overall revenues is gradually declining and has dropped from 75% in 2012 to about 69% in 2017. Even then, with an ever growing customer base and a high retention rate of clients of over 90%, the company is in a strong position to generate sustained revenue growth in this segment.View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis): |  | The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADP Is Expected To Continue With Its Strong Growth Momentum In Q1 Fiscal 2018@2017-11-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adp-expected-continue-its-strong-growth-momentum-q1-fiscal-2018-2017-11-01

Revenue rose 4% to $817 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.62. The consensus analyst estimate was for EPS of $0.60 on revenue of $821 million.The company also raised its outlook for the fiscal year. Human resources services revenue for the full year, which comprised 43% of service revenue this quarter, is now projected to grow 12% to 14%, versus a previous estimate of 8% to 10%. Guidance for total revenue growth was hiked from 5% to 6%. The improvement in outlook reflects in part the impact of the company's August acquisition of HR Outsourcing, Inc., a national professional employer organization (PEO).""We posted solid growth across our major human capital management (""HCM"") product lines in the first quarter, in particular our comprehensive human resource (""HR"") outsourcing solutions and our cloud-based time and attendance products continue to perform well,"" said CEO Martin Mucci in the press release.Observers often look to Paychex's reports to get an idea of how small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. are doing, since the company's results in part reflect job and wage growth in companies that outsource human resources functions. During the conference call, company management said that small business job growth has ""moderated"" after a burst late last year. But investors seem encouraged about the company's progress, especially its efforts to expand its PEO business.

Moreover, the company registered year-over year improvement on both the counts.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and grew 11% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $816 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2% from the year-ago period to $457.8 million, primarily on the back of higher revenues per check and client base.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 7% year over year to $345.3 million, chiefly driven by strong growth in client base and worksite employees, elevated revenues from retirement, as well as online HR administration services. The growth was partially offset by tough comparisons wherein the segment's revenues benefited from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to $13.7 million, mainly benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses flared up 2% from the year-ago tally to $471.8 million due to increased investments in technology and PEO business.

It generated operating cash flow of $343.6 million during the reported quarter.During the quarter, Paychex paid $179.1 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth $94.1 million.Buoyed by splendid fiscal first-quarter results, the company raised its revenues outlook. The company now anticipates total revenues to jump 6%, up from the previous estimate of 5%. This translates to revenues of $3.34 billion, which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.31 billion.Human Resource Services revenues are now projected to grow in the range of 12-14%, up from 8-10% projected earlier.Apart from this, the company revised its guidance for operating margin and effective tax rate.

If you're looking for a beat, you have to like the company's track record.3.  has the prettiest chart this week. It has missed only twice in the last 5 years. Will another beat push shares to new highs?4.  is a cheater as it was only spun off from Yum Brands in 2016. But it has now reported three times as a stand-alone company and has beat all three times. It's the largest fast food operator in China. If you want to know how strong the Chinese economy is, tune into this earnings report.5.  makes consumer products like OXO kitchen gadgets, Hot Tools curling irons and Dr. Scholl's insoles.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.7%. Over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 23.1%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Micron offers both DRAM and NAND products. While DRAM chips are key components in PCs, NAND flash chips are crucial for portable electronic devices. So far, the fiscal 2017 has been marvellous for the company.In the last reported quarter, Micron's top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as marked tremendous year-over-year growth, primarily due to pricing improvement in DRAM and NAND sales volume.We believe that the improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips make investors confident about Micron's growth. Per various sources, prices for these specific chips have improved chiefly due to a better product-mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.We believe that any elevation in prices will have a favorable influence on the company's top line, the benefit of which will likely trickle down to the bottom line. The benefit from improved pricing was well reflected in the company's last quarterly results as well. We anticipate these benefits to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's earnings is pegged at $1.83 on $5.95-billion revenue projection. | Additionally, we are positive about the company's strategy of enhancing its operating capabilities through acquisitions which are likely to boost its top-line performance.Also, it is worth mentioning that the buyout of Inotera in December 2016 will have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment and cadence, followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.However, after acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital  has become a key player in the NAND space, which could heighten competition in the industry.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Micron will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below: Micron's Earnings ESP is -0.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Accenture Plc  , has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%, and carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see Paychex, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% and a Zacks Rank #2.If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Moreover, the company's acquisitions of Portware, Revere Data, Matrix Data, Code Red and BISAM Technologies S.A will enhance product suite and aid it to evolve as a global financial database company. It will also help FactSet to maximize value for partners and provide exclusive content set.FactSet has a high client retention ratio which is another positive.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.33%. Notably, over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are positive about Accenture's latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the company's strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe these will have a positive influence on the company's upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner gave some optimism about Accenture's near-term performance. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to grow 2.4% to $3.48 trillion, marking a solid recovery after two consecutive years of decline.The research firm noted two major catalysts which, it believes, will drive IT spending this year. The first catalyst highlighted by Gartner is decline in the U.S. dollar against several foreign currencies. Secondly, the firm foresees an uptick in digital transformation projects in the near term, which will enable organizations to spend more on IT related infrastructure, products, and services. All these encourage us about the company's fiscal fourth-quarter overall performance.Nonetheless, Accenture's February 2017 announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. The company has already started to work on this space, by opening two innovation centers and hiring people over there.The company is believed to be preparing itself for a more protectionist U.S. technology-visa program under President Trump. It should be noted that out of more than 394,000 of its total workforce, 140,000 are in India, which provides it a cost advantage. With the addition of 15,000 new jobs, Accenture's total employee count in the United States will increase by 30% to 65,000, thereby increasing its salary expenses significantly.Additionally, heightening competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions  and International Business Machines Corporation, as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's earnings is pegged at $1.46 on $9-billion revenue projection. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

"n recent trading, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $57.72, changing hands for $58.16/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Paychex Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.77. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $63.00. The standard deviation is $4.907.But the whole reason to look at the  PAYX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PAYX crossing above that average target price of $57.72/share, investors in PAYX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $57.72 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Paychex Inc:

So how does this look as a turnaround investment?On the first metric, stock performance, ADP seems like a weak turnaround candidate. Its shares sell for 28x earnings and 17.1x EBITDA - one of the most expensive stocks among large-cap companies. Perhaps more important, its three-year returns of nearly 50% have doubled the S&P 500's returns [1] . It is a tough road to convince shareholders that the company has a serious problem when its returns and valuation are indicating the exact opposite.With Metric #3, asset and cash flow utilization, Pershing Square seems to have little concern with this, as their plans include ""no changes in the credit rating, capital structure, dividend policy or client funds investment strategy."" So there is little chance that the activist can use this metric to boost ADP's returns.Metric #4 doesn't seem to be a source of upside, either. Investors don't think ADP has any major problems with how it is being managed. One possible issue that will have analysts sharpening their pencils, however, is Pershing Square's comment that management hides lackluster operating performance through ""complex accounting."" While unlikely, if it were true, investor sentiment could quickly shift against ADP.ADP's vulnerability to Pershing Square's campaign rests with its operating margins (Metric #2), which are about half those of Paychex (Nasdaq:  ), a reasonably close peer company. The activist points to issues such as a ""bloated cost structure,"" stagnant productivity, under-investment in technology and other problems that if corrected could boost ADP's earnings by 50% and double its stock price in four years. Pershing Square's numbers and arguments appeared reasonably researched.The margin shortfall argument might carry a lot more weight if it weren't for Metric #5: bargaining power. ADP management has a powerful edge here - the impressive shareholder returns provide a naturally strong defense against Pershing Square. Pershing Square's negotiating power, furthermore, is weak. Their credibility is damaged by its bungled attempt to fix J.C. Penney (  ) along with sizeable losses from its Valeant Pharmaceuticals (  ) investment and other campaigns.Institutional investors, whose support Pershing will need in a proxy contest, may be hesitant to back such an outspoken and controversial person like Bill Ackman. Also weakening its credibility - Pershing Square brings little operational expertise. Furthermore, 75% of Pershing Square's stake is in the form of low-credibility options, not actual shares. Options do not have a vote, and imply a short-term outlook.Watch to see if ADP's CEO Carlos Rodriguez inadvertently helps Pershing. His aggressive and sometimes personal stance against Ackman could backfire, as investors could increasingly question why a supposedly secure and capable CEO would engage in a public low-brow spat. Their 68-page rebuttal from their September 12th presentation is  .Overall, because of the stock's strong returns and Ackman's weak credibility, we would give this activist campaign a low chance of making ADP a successful turnaround investment.Trian Partners' recent interest in Procter & Gamble is more intriguing. The activist firm, led by Nelson Peltz, took a 37.6 million share stake (about 1.5%) in the consumer products company in February 2017, and published a 94-page slide presentation,  , last week outlining their plans.This campaign has a better chance of producing a favorable stock price outcome. First, P&G stock has been a laggard, gaining only about 12% in the past three years, or about half the S&P 500 return [1] and has also trailed the return of the overall consumer staples sector. While the shares trade at a high valuation, 22.3x earnings and 14x EBITDA, it is in-line with its peer companies.On Metric #2, operating margins, P&G lags peers by a moderate gap. Trian legitimately claims that prior productivity programs have not delivered meaningful margin improvements, which casts doubt on the company's current $10 billion cost-cutting program. Perhaps more important, but a bit harder to prove, is Trian's view that the margins should be a lot wider given all the cost-cutting and investments that P&G has made. Trian's reasonable points here add strength to their case.Trian only modestly touches upon Metric #3, asset and cash flow utilization. P&G has few glaring issues with its balance sheet or cash flow utilization. Others have advanced the potential to break-up P&G, which might unlock value but Trian avoids these discussions, for now. Overall, Metric #3 provides a very modest and down-the-road tailwind.Metric #4 provides a major source of hope for turnaround investors. The market knows something isn't quite right at P&G. Despite management's exhortations, the revenue growth and market share trends are disappointing. Although it is difficult to identify a single direct cause, Trian's claims about weak innovation, low internal accountability, insular management and board, and incentives for producing sub-par profits are likely to strike a chord with investors. While the profit situation is certainly not dire, P&G's status as a market-wide ""core holding"" demands better results.Management's bargaining power is reasonably strong, but we think Trian narrowly has the upper hand. P&G's power comes largely from their position as incumbent and their somewhat defensible performance. Peltz, however, has tapped into growing investor frustration, is well-regarded, has strong consumer products company expertise with a good track record and takes a professional approach to influencing companies and shareholders.Further boosting Trian's likelihood of success in the proxy battle is the modest nature of his proposal: adding a single person (Peltz) to P&G's 11-person board. His agenda includes more accountability, more outside talent, a better organization structure and other measures to improve the company's operating performance.He is not advocating for a breakup of the company, replacement of the CEO or other more aggressive moves. Nearly all their 1.5% stake appears to be in common stock. Overall, Trian's one-step-at-a-time actions increase their likelihood of success, and make it easier for the legions of mutual fund and ETF shareholders to support its campaign.For turnaround investors, the Trian campaign appears to have a win-win opportunity for investors - either Peltz joins the board and learns enough to re-invigorate P&G, or loses and management must either execute (boosting earnings and the shares) or they will face a more drastic proxy campaign with higher odds of success down the road. We think the P&G campaign could turn out well for shareholders.Both ADP and Procter & Gamble have proxy meetings in coming months and the run-up to each should be illuminating.[1] Returns are price-only.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@A Closer Look At 2 Activist Campaigns - ADP/Pershing Square And Procter & Gamble/Trian Partners@2017-09-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/closer-look-2-activist-campaigns-adppershing-square-and-procter-gambletrian-partners-2017

 reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 66 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents. The figure included tax benefit of a penny related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance.Earnings declined 4.3% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to company's Service Alignment Initiative. However, revenues of $3.07 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.05 billion and grew 5.7% on a year-over-year basis.ADP reported revenues of $12.4 billion in fiscal 2017, which grew 6% over fiscal 2016 and was in line with management's guidance. Organically, the growth was 7%.ADP's stock has gained 3.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the  it belongs to. The outperformance can be attributed to consistent revenue performance and improving operational efficiency.Moreover, ADP's fiscal 2018 guidance forecasts new business bookings to increase 5% to 7% against a 5% decline in fiscal 2017. The Service Alignment will boost results going forward, which will eventually help the stock to maintain its momentum in the long run. | Employer Services revenues in the quarter increased 2% year over year to $2.34 billion.

The company's average client funds balance inched up 3% year over year to $23.9 billion in the quarter, while average interest yield of 1.8% was up 10 bps on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted EBIT margin declined almost 240 bps to 14.3% primarily due to increased investments on product, sales, and service, including dual operation costs related to the company's Service Alignment Initiative.Employer Services segment margin decreased approximately 210 bps on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, PEO Services segment margin increased approximately 10 bps in the quarter.ADP anticipates fiscal 2018 revenue growth to be in the range of 5-6% over fiscal 2016. Management expects revenue growth at the lower end of the guided range in the first half of fiscal 2018, and at the higher end in the second half of fiscal 2018.The projection assumes worldwide new business bookings growth of 5% to 7%.ADP expects adjusted earnings to grow in the range of 2-4%. Adjusted EBIT margin is forecasted to decline 25-50 bps for the fiscal year.Employer Services segment revenues is expected to grow almost in the range of 2-3%. Margin is projected to decline in the range of 50 to 75 bps for the year.ADP expects pays per control to increase 2.5% for fiscal 2018. For the PEO Services segment, management anticipates 11% to 13% revenue growth and margin expansion of 25 bps to 50 bps.Interest on funds held for clients is expected to increase $40-$50 million, or about 11%.

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have lost about 6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Paychex reported better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein the top and bottom lines came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, the company registered improvement on both the counts.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and grew 10% year over year, mainly on the back of higher revenues.Paychex reported total revenue (including interest on funds held for clients) of $798.6 million, up 6% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) ascended 6% year over year to $784.6 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $798 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2% from the year-ago period to $440.9 million, primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base. Also, the acquisition of Advanced Partners contributed 1% to payroll service revenue growth.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 10% year over year to $343.7 million, chiefly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement, as well as online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to $14 million, primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses flared up 5% from the year-ago tally to $499.7 million due to higher wages and related expenses resulting from increased headcount in operations. However, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 62.6%.The company's operating income grew 8% year over year to $298.9 million. In addition, Paychex's operating margin expanded 80 bps to 37.4%.Net income came in at $195.3 million, up from $178.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Paychex exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $323.4 million compared with $403.9 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. It generated operating cash flow of $960.4 million during fiscal 2017.During the fiscal, Paychex paid $662.3 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth $166.2 million.Paychex provided its outlook for fiscal 2018. Management expects Payroll Service revenues to increase year over year in the range of 1-2%, while Human Resource Services revenues are anticipated to grow in a range of 8-10%. Interest on funds held for its clients and investment income are now projected to grow in the mid-to-upper-teen range.Total revenue is estimated to increase by nearly 5%. This translates to revenues of $3.309 billion.Operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 40%. Net income is likely to advance 5% year over year on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non-GAAP basis.Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to increase in the range of 7% to 8% which comes to $2.35 - $2.38.Effective income tax rate is now projected to be in the band of 35.5-36%.Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter. | At this time, Paychex's stock has a poor Growth Score of 'F', however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a 'B'. The stock was allocated a grade of 'D' on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'F'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is solely suitable for momentum investors.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock.

 appears to be striving to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization (PEO) industry. In this regard, the payroll and human resource solutions provider recently acquired Charlotte, NC-based HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (HROI) for an undisclosed amount.Founded in 2001, HROI is a well know name in the PEO industry, which, along with its subsidiaries, offers human resource solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in over 35 states across the U.S.A PEO is a firm or company to which organizations can outsource their HR functions, including payroll and benefits administration. The benefits offered by a PEO make it a viable choice for organizations.The most important benefit is that an organization gets full administrative support without investing in technology and employees. Apart from this, a PEO takes care of all aspects of an employee's tenure. Organizations get trained representatives who can better address their HR related matters. Moreover, the growing regulatory burden on small companies signifies that the need to outsource non-core activities is growing.Therefore, in our opinion, the acquisition is a strategic fit for Paychex as more and more companies are willing to use PEO services rather than creating their in-house HR management departments. Also, both the companies have similar target customers, small and medium-sized businesses.As of May 31, 2017, Paychex had nearly 605,000 payroll clients but the market is still highly untapped. Per the company, there are about 12 million businesses in the U.S. under its total addressable market, half of which are still untapped.The recent buyout of HROI will expand its services, thereby helping it to add to its customer base.The company's initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging. Since its inception, the company has completed 13 acquisitions of which eight were under the leadership of current president and CEO, Martin Mucci.These buyouts have helped the company to expand its services as well as global reach, thereby boosting its revenues. Notably, in the last five fiscals, i.e. 2012 to 2017, the company has seen its revenues rise at a CAGR of 7.2%.Going ahead, one of the key secular growth drivers of Paychex is the demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost saving potential.The company seeks to capitalize on this opportunity by periodically introducing products and services for upselling to the client base and moving into the mid-market.However, for the last few months, payroll client growth has been affected by political uncertainty, which in turn is impacting outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market. This was highlighted by Paychex during its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 conference call.This makes us sceptical about the company's near-term performance. Intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing  and Insperity  could add to its woes.Paychex has underperformed the  to which it belongs to in the last year. The stock has lost 8% of its value in the said period while the industry declined just  1.3%.Currently, Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.  which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .The stock has an estimated long-term EPS growth rate of 10%.Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

" is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Jul 27. Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 7.15%.In the last quarter, ADP delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.50%. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.31 per share increased 12% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues of $3.41 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.43 billion but grew 5% on a year-over-year basis.Management now expects new business bookings to decline year over year in fiscal 2017. Earlier, the company anticipated new business bookings to remain flat on a year-over-year basis. The decline in management's expectation primarily reflects growing competition from the likes of Paychex  , Equifax and The Ultimate Software Group.We note that ADP has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock has returned 1.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Apart from stiff competition, we expect ADP's investments in new initiatives to weigh on near-term earnings. Moreover, the divestiture of Consumer Health Spending Account (CHSA) and Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA) businesses will impact top-line growth. | Nevertheless, we note that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and human capital management (HCM) market, primarily owing to its robust product portfolio. This is also evident from the recent recognitions which the company's solutions have received.ADP's GlobalView HCM was named to the Constellation ShortList for Global Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for the second consecutive quarter in April.In May, Frost & Sullivan honored ADP as the ""2016 North American HR Management Solutions Company of the Year"".ADP's Accountant Connect solution also received ""2017 CPA Practice Advisor Tax and Accounting Technology Innovation Award"" in Jun.We believe that the company's product strength will continue to drive higher revenue per client and customer retention ratio in the going-to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ADP is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : ADP's Earnings ESP is +2.99%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 69 cents is couple of cents higher that the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : However, ADP carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor  has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see IPG Photonics Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and boasts a Zacks Rank #1.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

or many Americans, retirement represents the finish line. The point at which they can put their feet up, throw their alarm clock out, and not have a care in the world. But for many, this dream ignores two very key components: increasing life expectancies and a potentially insufficient nest egg.Since 1970, the average life expectancy in the U.S. has increased by eight years to 78.8 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It means today's retirees can often expect that they'll need their retirement money to last in the neighborhood of one decade longer than their grandparents' generation did. Without the proper planning, they could run out of money. By a similar token, some seniors are entering retirement with far too little saved.Image source: Getty Images.Retirement might mean stepping away from your lifetime career, but it doesn't mean retiring from investing. Continuing to invest in the stock market during your golden years can allow you an opportunity to increase your wealth and ensure you have enough money to comfortably last throughout your retirement.Of course, how you invest once you've retired tends to be notably different from how you invested when you were working. Capital preservation and income generation tend to take on much greater importance when retired. Nevertheless, you can still find high-quality stocks that can give you a good shot at capital appreciation, while pocketing an above-average dividend.Here are four stocks to keep you invested after retirement.Rather than playing the guessing game with the somewhat volatile healthcare sector, a company that  for retirees is  (NYSE: HCP) , a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a focus on acquiring and leasing buildings and offices in the healthcare space. It has a particular focus on life-science buildings devoted to drug development, senior housing facilities, and medical offices.Image source: Getty Images.Why HCP? It's a simple numbers game that should put investors on the winning side. The U.S. Census Bureau anticipates that the 65-and-over crowd will nearly double, from 48 million to 88 million, between 2015 and 2050. That's 40 million extra seniors that could need some form of quality of care assistance in their future, ranging from surgical procedures to medicines and both short- and long-term care. HCP, as an owner and lessee of medical properties, should have little issue finding tenants and charging rents that keep pace or outpace the inflation rate.Plus, since HCP is structured as a REIT, which gives it tax benefits in return for paying out at least 90% of its profits in the form of a dividend to shareholders, you're bound to get a very handsome annual payout. HCP shareholders are currently collecting 4.7% annually on their investment, which is more than double the yield of the  .Another large-cap company that tends to fly under the radar but could be perfect for retired folks is payroll-processing service giant  (NASDAQ: PAYX) . In particular, Paychex brings two simple advantages to the table.Image source: Getty Images.First, like HCP, Paychex should be able to take advantage of the numbers game. It's been shown that the U.S. economy tends to grow over time. Yes, recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, too, but over time we tend to see a steady increase in U.S. GDP and the aggregate number of employed Americans. As a company that specializes in being the payroll processing service for businesses of all sizes, this long-term trend works in its favor by steadily increasing the number of businesses utilizing its services, and presumably giving it decent pricing power for its services.The other factor worth monitoring is that we're coming off historically low interest rates, which pushed short-term yields way down. Payroll processors typically receive the cash that's to be paid to employees days in advance, and they invest this pooled money into short-term, very safe interest-bearing assets. As the Federal Reserve moves forward with its tightening policy, interest rates and yields are rising, which should  for a company like Paychex.All told, retirees are currently privy to a 3.5% yield with Paychex.The utility sector is typically a great investment source for retirees, because it gives them a moat of companies that sell a basic-need good, like electricity or water. In particular,  (NYSE: NEE) is a company that retired folks might want to give a serious look.Image source: Getty Images.While most electric utilities offer little differentiation from one another, NextEra Energy is  thanks to its reliance on alternative energies for electricity generation. Last year, nearly half (49%) of its electricity was generated using natural gas, 26% came from nuclear power, and a whopping 20% was derived from wind power. In 2015, no company generated more power from wind or solar than NextEra Energy. The reason this investment in alternative and renewable energies is so important is that it'll lower the company's long-term costs, as well as that of its customers, putting it on the leading edge of innovation in the utility sector.Just as important, NextEra Energy is predominantly a regulated utility, meaning it requires the OK of state regulatory commissions before it can increase rates on consumers. While that might sound like a nuisance, it's actually good news, since it keeps the company minimally exposed to wholesale electricity prices. The result is very predictable cash flow and profits.NextEra is currently yielding 2.8%, which easily tops the broad-market S&P 500.A final stock that could keep retirees in the game is the leading appliance manufacturer in the world,  (NYSE: WHR) . Like the companies already discussed, broad trends are a big reason Whirlpool could be attractive to retirees.Image source: Whirlpool.To begin with, a growing population and a steady increase in domestic and global housing offers what should be a steady stream of opportunities for Whirlpool to get its products in new and remodeled homes. Yes, Whirlpool's business is intricately tied to that of the global economy, but as noted, the global economy tends to increase in size over the long run. This suggests that long-term investors should benefit from Whirlpool's innovation, a growing global population, and an expanding global housing market.Whirlpool also has a multi-year or multi-decade opportunity to  . The North American market will remain critical to Whirlpool's success, but acquisitions throughout Asia over the past couple of years, as an example, provides a channel to reach a burgeoning middle-class of new homeowners. Not shockingly, sales growth in Asia came in at 16% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter, and it could remain in the double-digits for some time to come. Whirlpool has a similar opportunity in the Middle East and Africa.Whirlpool's 2.3% yield may not look like much now, but considering its projected cash flow growth in the years to come, I'd anticipate it'll head considerably higher.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Paychex wasn't one of them!

"f you are still holding shares of  in your portfolio, it is time to dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term seem bleak.This is because Paychex has underformed the Zacks Categorized  industry in the last three months. The company has lost 2.8% compared with the Outsourcing industry's gain of 4.4% during the same period.Analysts have become increasingly bearish on this stock with 10 out of 13, who cover the stock, revising the estimate downward. With no upward revision in the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 declined from $2.39 per share to $2.37. This indicates tepid prospects for the company.Paychex provided its outlook for fiscal 2018. Total revenue is estimated to increase by nearly 5%. This translates to revenues of $3.309 billion, which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to increase in the range of 7% to 8% which comes to $2.35-$2.38 (mid-point $2.365 per share). The earnings per share guidance range is however, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.37 at its mid-point.Currently, Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Also, the company has a very poor VGM Score of ""F."" The Zacks VGM Style Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps in identifying those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum across the board. Stocks with a VGM Style Score of 'A' or 'B' and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), have even better returns, on average, than the individual components, as it considers three times as many items that are correlated to future stocks returns.On the valuation front too, the stock looks unattractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 23.9x, higher than the Zacks categorized Outsourcing industry's average of 22.1x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock's current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. The higher the P/E of a stock, the poorer is the value for an investor.Going forward, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity  remain primary concerns.We expect the aforementioned factors to hurt the company's near-term profitability. Hence, we recommend investors to stay away from Paychex until the Zacks Rank, VGM score and estimates improve.A better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector is Applied Materials, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see Applied Materials has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.6%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2%, respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

"When a clock is broken, it's right twice a day. But when a permabear warns a stock market crash is coming ""any day now,"" how many times can they be right?Well, if you've been waiting for a crash since the last one, you've been waiting for almost a decade. And that just empowers the bears to say it's inevitable--it's been so long since the last crash, surely another one is coming soon, right?Wrong.Here are three reasons why the stock market is set to keep going up.In the first quarter, analysts predicted 9% earnings growth for S&P 500 companies, and that helped the benchmark  and  rise over 8% in the first half of 2017.But here's the thing: analysts were wrong--in the best way possible.In reality, earnings spiked 14% from the prior year in Q1, the strongest quarterly rate since the Great Recession ended in 2009 (and  we expect to translate their rising profits into fatter payouts for investors).Because of that 14% bump in profits, the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio remained pretty much flat, despite the index's price growth:It's true that the stock market is pricier than it's ever been, but it's not getting radically more expensive--and that suggests the market is neither in a bubble nor poised to crash.Earnings growth in a single quarter is good--but will it continue?All signs point to yes.Analysts expect 6.6% earnings growth in the second quarter, but remember that they were overly pessimistic for Q1, so the actual results could be higher. So far, just a handful of companies have reported results, and they've seen 6.5% earnings growth.But what's most interesting is the excuses these companies make for having ""only"" 6.5% earnings growth. Chief among them: the strong US dollar.Funny thing is, the dollar has actually been getting weaker, not stronger.Why does this matter? Well, management is good at making excuses when it comes to the bottom line, and if there's a big external trend they can point to that can account for their weaker performance, they'll pounce on it. That's why we're hearing a lot about the dollar these days, even though that excuse is looking pretty threadbare.What's more, the strong economy has taken away other ""real"" ailments, like job insecurity, weak wage growth, lackluster consumer demand and rising commodity prices.That strong economy is going to lead to higher earnings for  . We already saw it in the first quarter, and there's plenty of reason to think it will accelerate. The Federal Reserve is projecting 2.6% GDP growth for the second quarter, far above the 1.2% we saw in the Q1. This is just a continuation what we've seen since the start of 2016, where GDP growth accelerated sharply:All of this growth will drive more sales to more S&P 500 companies, driving more revenue and more profit opportunities.What's driving this improving economy? If you guessed the American consumer, you guessed right.For decades, US shoppers have been the engine of economic productivity, not only in the United States but around the globe. That hasn't changed--which is why 2007-09's calamity was bad for the entire planet, not just the US. But American consumers are finally back on their feet and ready to spend more aggressively.Want proof? Look at wages. Incomes are rising at a steady pace in the US, but wage gains are spreading beyond the top tier of income earners toward folks with more modest paychecks, who account for the bulk of demand. These workers have been essentially stuck at the same pay rate due to an unchanged minimum wage, while job insecurity has made it all but impossible for them to demand higher wages.That's changing.Case in point: the retail sector, where chains are already complaining that higher wages are a serious and growing expense. In its last quarterly ,  highlighted higher payroll expenses as an added expense because the firm is ""chasing wage rates.""Similarly,  ,  and  have all highlighted higher wage costs as an additional expense. Paychex noted expenses grew 5% due to ""higher wages and related expenses due to growth in head count.""Here's the thing: for many Americans, the nightmare of 2007-09 is  a distant memory. I know it still has a profound effect on how I save and spend money, and the same goes for many of my friends and relatives. Once-casual spenders who regularly enjoyed retail therapy and lived paycheck to paycheck have pivoted to a dramatically different lifestyle. Even those who have lower incomes now compared to before the crisis still save a much larger portion of their income than they used to.But slowly, people are getting used to the idea that we won't see another 2007-09 event anytime soon, and they're a bit safer in their economic situation than they used to be. We're only seeing the beginning of that trend. Consumer spending is up a whopping 4.9% year over year, with a lot of that going to discretionary purchases. And that's good news for the stock market.So ignore the permabears; this market is doing just fine--and it's got plenty of room to run yet.A rising stock market is great, but there's a problem: those rising share prices are driving dividend yields through the floor.As I write, the S&P 500 pays a pathetic 1.9%, which isn't even enough to get you ""over the hump"" of inflation! So if you're a dividend hound looking for a place to put your money, it's a real desert out there.Luckily, there's an answer: closed-end funds.Closed-end what?If you haven't heard of them, don't feel bad. Few investors know CEFs exist.Here's the upshot: they let you invest in  but  with one BIG difference: In fact, my 4 favorite CEFs are throwing off fat (and safe)  PLUS they're  trading at big discounts to their net asset value (or the value of their underlying holdings).That means we can bank on And these 4 retirement lifesavers are easy to buy: it's really just a matter of swapping over the ETFs or regular stocks you already hold.All you need to do is The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Is the Worst Advice You Could Follow Now@2017-07-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/worst-advice-you-could-follow-now-2017-07-20
"n recent trading, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $57.64, changing hands for $57.84/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Paychex Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.77. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $63.00. The standard deviation is $4.815.But the whole reason to look at the  PAYX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PAYX crossing above that average target price of $57.64/share, investors in PAYX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $57.64 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Paychex Inc:

"tocks rebounded strongly on Wednesday, with the  (DJINDICES: ^DJI) closing up well over 100 points and the  (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gaining almost a full percentage point.Data source: Yahoo! Finance.Small-cap stocks bested the overall market, with the  (NYSEMKT: IWM) up 1.5% and the  (NYSEMKT: XBI) soaring 2.6%.As for individual stocks, shares of homebuilder  (NYSE: KBH) jumped following a strong earnings report, and payroll service provider  (NASDAQ: PAYX) tumbled after giving weak guidance for the upcoming year.Image source: Getty Images.KB Home provided the latest evidence of a  with a strong earnings report for its second quarter. Revenue grew 24% to $1 billion, and net income more than doubled to $31.8 million, or $0.33 per share. The results blew away analysts' expectations for EPS of $0.26 on sales of $927 million. Shares of KB Homes gained 5.4% on the news.Business was strong across the board. The number of homes delivered increased 11% and the average selling price grew 11% to $385,900. Housing gross profits jump 23%, and homebuilding operating profit margin excluding inventory-related charges increased to 5.6% from 4.7% in the period a year earlier. Orders were strong as well, pointing to healthy growth for the rest of the year. Orders were up 15%, driven by an increase of 23% in the West Coast region, and the backlog grew 19% to $2.18 billion.Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Mezger was upbeat about the outlook for housing. ""The housing market recovery continues on a steady path, supported by favorable industry fundamentals,"" he said in the press release. ""Recent improvements in consumer sentiment and employment, combined with relatively low mortgage interest rates, are signaling further strength in the demand for housing. At the same time, the supply of available homes in many areas across the country remains insufficient to satisfy current needs.""Coming on the heels of a  last week that included similar comments about the strength of demand for new homes, the news boosted optimism about the industry, and other housing-related companies saw their stocks rise as well.Payroll and human resources service provider Paychex reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations, but its 2018 guidance disappointed investors.

"Shares of HR support and payroll software specialists  (NASDAQ: ADP) and its archrival,  (NASDAQ: PAYX) , are both up modestly since the year began -- not a lot, just a little. But even so, Goldman Sachs thinks it's time for investors to quit while they're ahead and begin pulling back on both stocks.This morning, Goldman Sachs announced it is canceling its buy ratings and downgrading shares of both ADP and Paychex to neutral. Here are three things you need to know about that.HR stocks ADP and Paychex are in focus at Goldman Sachs this morning. Image source: Getty Images.Seven months ago, with the memory of President Trump's electoral college victory fresh in its mind, Goldman Sachs was singing an entirely different tune, and upgrading both Automatic Data Processing stock, and Paychex stock, too, on faith that an economic recovery was at hand.As  (requires subscription) wrote at the time, small business sentiment had been on the rise ever since ""the election. Job creation plans increased from a net 9% through November 8 to a net 23% after the election."" That was obviously good news for HR support firms like ADP and Paychex, and Goldman Sachs predicted these firms would be ""among the main beneficiaries of potential tax policy changes proposed by the Trump administration and [interest] rate hikes.""On the one hand, lower taxes would immediately benefit the companies' bottom lines. At the same time, higher interest rates (which sound bad on the surface) would actually be a benefit to firms like ADP and Paychex, boosting their returns on their bank deposits. Goldman estimated that every 1% hike in national interest rates would boost ADP's net profit by 2.3%, and add 3.7% to Paychex's bottom line.Based on those assumptions, seven months ago, Goldman Sachs predicted Automatic Data Processing stock would be going to $114 per share within 12 months, while Paychex stock would be headed to $68. Accordingly, the analyst upgraded Paychex to buy, and ADP to ""conviction"" buy. But while both stocks  progressed toward their respective goals, Goldman is no longer convinced they're going to get the rest of the way there.Today, Goldman is warning that tax reform and lower interest rates are ""taking longer to play out"" than it had hoped. Meanwhile, ""payroll growth continues to slow and regulatory uncertain[ties] surround[ding] [the Affordable Care Act] and [Department of Labor] remain which impacts HR spending decisions."" Seeing ""delayed corporate HR spending"" affecting both stocks, Goldman says ""bookings growth"" looks ""sluggish,"" which will further weigh on earnings.Accordingly, Goldman Sachs is walking back its earnings estimates and cutting its price targets (and ratings) as well. Although Goldman still sees ADP earning $3.70 per share this year, it's subtracting a nickel from next year's estimates (now $3.95 per share) and $0.15 from 2019 estimates (now $4.40).In contrast, Paychex's 2017 earnings estimate holds steady at $2.27 per share, with $2.35 and $2.25 still forecast for 2018 and 2019, respectively.Goldman's new prediction of a $64 stock price for Paychex leaves less than 5% upside in the stock -- not enough to merit a buy rating in Goldman's view. Similarly, Goldman now sees ADP stock rising from today's $103 share price to just $108 per share over the next 12 months -- also a 5% rise. Still, while it's no longer recommending buying ADP and Paychex, Goldman Sachs still thinks the stocks are worth holding onto.The real question for investors is this: ADP stock currently sells for 26.7 times trailing earnings, while Paychex stock is even more expensive at 27.4 times earnings. Yet according to Goldman's latest estimates, ADP earnings will grow less than 14% this year, while Paychex earnings will rise by a mere 9% -- and then the growth rate of  stocks will slow dramatically in 2018.Goldman Sachs thinks those collapsing growth rates still merit hanging onto these very expensive stocks. Personally, I'd be downgrading both ADP and Paychex, too, but I'd be taking them down a whole lot more than just to neutral.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ur societal dependence on technology has made us increasingly more vulnerable to internet attacks. That's why an ever-increasing number of companies are to looking to internet security companies like  (NASDAQ: FEYE) to help keep them safe.However, while FireEye's revenue has grown rapidly over the last few years, the company's stock hasn't followed suit. Shares have declined more than 56% since FireEye's IPO, which leads some of us Fools to question whether or not this company has what it takes to be a great investment.So which fast-growing companies do we think are better bets than FireEye today? Three Fool contributors picked  (NYSE: DATA) ,  (NASDAQ: TRUE) , and  (NYSE: PAYC) .Image source: Getty Images. If there's a company that matches FireEye's growth and long-term potential with its short-term losses, it's Tableau Software. The company makes analytic software used by businesses, but has been pounded by the market as it's lost money reconfiguring its business model to create more recurring revenue.Tableau has been adding customers and booking backlog as it transitions to a subscription model, but like most companies that change from one-time sales to subscriptions, the financial impact is negative in the short term. You can see below that while revenue is up, net income has plunged over the last two years. data by  .Long-term, the transition to a subscription model is anticipated to lead to higher operating margins and higher profitability. Management said that after breaking even on a non-GAAP basis in 2017, it expects margins to improve beginning in 2018. And as margins improve, Tableau Software will begin to live up to its potential as a company, and the stock could follow as a result. One time-honored way to build a business is to look for pain points -- things people just hate -- and create a lower-pain alternative. For a lot of people, the process of buying a new car is one of the more painful experiences in their lives. That's where TrueCar comes in.TrueCar works with a huge network of over 11,000 new-car dealers to provide a simplified way for people to buy the new vehicles they want. Shoppers use an easy process on TrueCar's site to select the vehicle they want and find out the average price paid for that same model by others. They can then choose to be connected to local dealers who will give their last, best prices on the vehicle in question, right up front.It's quick and painless and it's free for consumers. TrueCar gets paid by the dealers when purchases are completed. Those payments averaged $324 per purchase in the first quarter of 2017, on about 217,000 purchases.Profit? TrueCar doesn't have any yet. But its losses are narrowing, and it's growing at a nice clip. Revenue in the first quarter  , to $75.8 million, and its net loss narrowed to $6.8 million from $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2016.CEO Chip Perry, who  , is planning to generate further growth by adding more tools and information to support consumers throughout the purchase process. According to J.D. Power, almost 60% of people who use the internet to shop for a car stop by TrueCar's site. Perry's plan is to find ways to capture more and more of them over time -- and, he emphasizes, to give them all a great (and painless) experience.While TrueCar's offering might seem easy for a competitor to duplicate, the company actually has a bit of a moat: Under Perry, it has built strong relationships with dealers, while building on the credibility and trust it has with consumers.TrueCar has a solid business today, and a clear path to growth that could drive big returns over time. While FireEye's stock market performance has been very disappointing, there's little doubt that the company is poised for rapid growth as demand for cybersecurity solutions continues to take off. That makes it challenging to find another company that can match FireEye's long-term revenue growth potential. However, I think Paycom Software could be up to the task.As its name suggests, Paycom specializes in payroll processing solutions, but there's far more to the company than that. While industry leaders like  and  primarily focus on payroll, Paycom has built out a suite of products that are used to manage an employee's entire life cycle. This includes nearly every HR function that an employee will come in contact with between hiring and retirement. What's more, all of these functions are managed by Paycom's cloud-based software, which eliminates the need for customers to install and maintain their own servers. When combined, these factors have allowed Paycom to rapidly gobble up market share among small and medium-sized businesses.Currently, Paycom counts more than 18,000 businesses as customers. That's a lot, but it is still tiny when compared to the 28  small businesses that reside in the U.S. alone. That hints that there is plenty of room left for Paycom to continue to win market share from here.Another attractive trait about Paycom is that the company is already highly profitable. In fact, last quarter Paycom cranked out more than  , which is an impressive achievement given that the company is still so early in its growth cycle. In addition, the company's stock has been a massive home run for investors who got in at the IPO, which is a trait that we Fools  in growth investments.All in all, Paycom offers investors a highly profitable business model and plenty of room for future growth. To me, that makes it a much more attractive investment than FireEye.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But the market is a forward-looking animal, and discussions about whether that kind of growth is sustainable invariably turn to Paycom's moat -- or, rather, its lack of one. How is this tiny company  at the expense of deep-pocketed industry giants like  and  ?The short answer is that I don't think there's any single thing Paycom offers that its customers can't get from another company. Paycom simply offers the smaller-sized businesses it targets (between 50 and 2,000 employees, generally) a very attractive combination of product, service, and pricing. That said, several quotes from the company's most recent  illustrate a few things that are helping Paycom win clients and keep its competitors at bay.Image source: Paycom Software.Paycom's software solution is one integrated application that runs on a single cloud-based database. This eliminates the headaches created by using different software for diverse functions including payroll, time entry and tracking, recruiting, performance reviews, and compliance with government regulations.Chad Richison, Paycom CEO, provided these examples on  :Richison also noted that clients are drawn to Paycom's level of customer service, which includes having reps on site to help with employee training:Paycom's not resting on its laurels, with Richison noting in a recent investor presentation that the company has increased its R&D budget 100% year over year for each of the past three years. And on the conference call, Richison stated:Interestingly, Paycom has a strategy of not hiring its salespeople from within the industry, which so far has been very effective. If I had to guess why, perhaps Paycom's smaller clients just feel more comfortable talking to these ""outsider"" types than industry sales vets. Richison noted:Moat or no moat, Paycom looks poised to gain an even stronger foothold with small- and medium-sized businesses, recently affirming its annual top-line growth goal of 30%. Despite all of its success, the company says it hasn't seen the competitive environment change a whole lot. This would seem to indicate that -- at least for the moment -- Paycom's smaller company niche still offers a lot of upside from here.Responding to whether the company is seeing its peers compete more aggressively for Paycom's target customers, Richison stated:When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"n recent trading, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $58.44, changing hands for $59.11/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 13 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Paychex Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $47.77. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $65.00. The standard deviation is $5.553.But the whole reason to look at the  PAYX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PAYX crossing above that average target price of $58.44/share, investors in PAYX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $58.44 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol Global ETF (Symbol: ACWV) where we have detected an approximate $47.2 million dollar inflow -- that's a 1.5% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 40,300,000 to 40,900,000). Among the largest underlying components of ACWV, in trading today Consolidated Edison Inc (Symbol: ED) is up about 0.4%, General Mills, Inc. (Symbol: GIS) is up about 0.1%, and Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is higher by about 0.8%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of ACWV, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, ACWV's low point in its 52 week range is $71.80 per share, with $78.96 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $78.59. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol Global ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2017-05-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-edge-msci-min-vol-global-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2017-05-18

 prudent investment decision means buying stocks that offer solid prospects and selling those that appear risky. Again, at times it is rational to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Here, we take into account  , a company with an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 8.88% and potential to perform well in the long run.Notably, Paychex outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year. The company gained 10.6% in the last one year compared with the Outsourcing industry's loss of 0.9%.We believe, this rally has been driven by Paychex's strong fundamentals and solid growth strategies.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company showed an uptrend in terms of earnings, as is evident from its earnings beat in all the trailing four quarters, marking an average positive earnings surprise of 2.23%.If we look into Paychex's past performance, we note that its third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues missed the same. The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 55 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and grew 10% year over year primarily on the back of higher revenues.Notably, the year-over-year improvement on both counts was encouraging. Moreover, the company's reiterated outlook for fiscal 2017 is praiseworthy, indicating that it is relatively well placed despite current macroeconomic sluggishness.Furthermore, we are optimistic about Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansion initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support the long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be other growth drivers. Also, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.Revenue growth is an important metric for any company as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. Also, revenue growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Paychex has grown significantly over the years by providing industry-leading service and technology solutions to its clients and their employees. Its solid business model, diversified products and services, and strategic acquisitions have boosted top-line growth. Notably, revenues grew at a four-year (2012-2016) CAGR of 7.3%. Higher revenues will expand margins and increase profitability in the long run.Paychex is affected by weak economic conditions as employment levels tend to decline and interest rates might become more volatile. Lower or falling interest rates generally result in a decline in Paychex's float income. These conditions may have an adverse effect on Paychex's business owing to lower transaction volumes or loss of clients. Potential clients tend to lower their overall spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. We believe that this will put pressure on Paychex, thereby lowering revenue growth potential.Moreover, competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity  remain the primary concerns.A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Broadcom Limited  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Broadcom has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13.6%.While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.

he biggest benefit of investing through a Roth IRA is that any gains can be withdrawn tax-free down the road as long as you  . That makes this investment vehicle a great place to put stocks that hold lots of long-term upside potential.With that in mind, here's why I think  (NYSE: PAYC) is an ideal stock to consider buying in your Roth IRA.Image source: Getty Images.Paycom's CEO and founder Chad Richison worked in the payroll industry for several frustrating years. Richison felt that the big players in payroll solutions offered products that were complicated to use and didn't provide employers with the tools they needed to effectively manage their business. In 1998, he set out on his own to create a better solution.Richison ended up launching the first cloud-based payroll processing software program in the country. What's more, he built his platform from the ground up with the goal of helping employers manage their employee's entire lifecycle. Today, Paycom's software can help HR teams with a range of critical functions like recruiting, time management, scheduling, training, benefits management, and more.Paycom's intuitive design and ever-expanding list of functions have proven to be a huge hit with businesses. The company has been rapidly  from coast to coast for years while maintaining a stellar retention rate of 91%. These numbers prove that the company can compete and win against industry giants like and  and  .One big benefit of offering software-as-a-service is that Paycom gets to bill for its services continually, providing the business with an ever-increasing source of recurring revenue. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 98% of Paycom's top line was derived from repeat business.With a dependable stream of revenue hitting its bank account each quarter, Paycom's management team can easily plan out its expenses to ensure that the bottom line also grows at a robust rate. That's exactly what investors have seen happen since the company's 2014 IPO. data by  .Meanwhile, the business is now throwing off enough cash that management can simultaneously invest in future growth  return cash to shareholders. We recently saw the company authorize and exhaust a $50 million stock repurchase program. That's not something you often see from fast-growing business.With a competitive platform on the market and a rock-solid business model in place, Paycom has turned its full attention to expansion. Thankfully, even today, it appears that the company still has plenty of room left for future growth. As of the end of 2016, Paycom only had sales offices in 32 of the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. As the map below indicates, there is still a lot of white space left to fill.Paycom Software sales office locations as of April 2017. Image source: Paycom Software.To take advantage of this wide-open market opportunity, management has announced plans to open 10 to 14 new sales offices through the country over the next few years. In addition, the company is already investigating the potential to expand overseas.Between gaining share in its existing markets and opening new sales offices, Paycom looks well positioned to post double-digit revenue and profit gains for years to come.Given all of the above, you might not be surprised to learn that Paycom has turned into a market darling. Shareholders who got in during the 2014 IPO have already enjoyed a gain of 250%, which is a market-crushing return. However, the company is currently trading at 78 times trailing earnings and 43 times forward earnings, both of which represent a huge premium to the market in general.Despite the premium price tag, I am personally of the belief that there is so much to like about Paycom's competitive position, financial statements, and market opportunity that they more than justify an investment today. If you agree, then buying Paycom through your Roth IRA could prove to be a financially savvy move.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now...and Paycom Software wasn't one of them!

"Near the end of March, the  broke its worst losing streak since 2011. Yep, that's right. If you're not a frequent trader, you may not have realized the index had fallen for eight straight sessions. But the quiet pullback did have its upside - it gave investors the chance to buy some of the best dividend stocks for a little cheaper than they'd been trading. Source: But even though we're past March and the streak has been snapped, the market is still presenting us with value opportunities. A number of high-quality dividend stocks - including several yielding north of 3% - are trading at enough of a discount that you should start considering initiating new positions (or adding to what you already have).Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) are especially discounted right now, but we've dug through other sectors as well. In this environment, stock-picking can be tough, given the number of stocks trading near or at record highs.Right now, we're looking for high yields that will generate return for us in the event that stocks trade flat or lower for the foreseeable future … but without investing in anything that has a high chance of getting clobbered and cancelling out all that income.This list of the 11 best dividend stocks to buy not only offer good to great yields, but all of them are projected to grow their earnings this year - an indication that each of these picks is headed in the right direction.Let's take a look. In no particular order … 4.3%Self-billed as ""The Monthly Dividend Company,""  (NYSE:  ) has become one of the most consistent dividend stocks in most income investors' portfolios.That doesn't need a qualifier such as ""among REITs."" Realty Income is a top performer among all kinds of stocks, returning more than 106% over the past 10 years, and more than 582% since its IPO. That's not via breakneck momentum, but just consistent growth - not only in the price of the stock, but also its dividends.Consider this: O stock has  for 560 consecutive months (46 years) and has raised its dividend for 78 consecutive quarters. With that kind of consistency, who wouldn't want to own Realty? It would be like getting a  .Two small negatives to point out: Realty Income's dividend of 4.3% is below what a number of other REITs pay, and it sports an above-average valuation of 18x price/funds from operations. However, investors should be more than OK with that because Realty Income is one of a very few blue-chip REITs that offer best-in-class earnings and dividend consistency. Translation: It has earned a premium.Some investors are worried that rising interest rates will be bad for Realty. I would argue the opposite is true. While it may keep pressure on the stock in 2017, rising rates indicate an improving economy. A stronger consumer and growing economy is great news for REITs like O, which already sport can't-miss tenants like  (NASDAQ:  ) and LA Fitness.If Realty Income declines a few percent to the mid-$50s, snap it up and don't look back. 4.5% (NYSE:  ) leaves a bad taste in many investors' mouths, as some still regard GM as ""Government Motors"" and refuse to forgive the automaker for its bankruptcy. Others will consider it a value trap or a company pressured by ""peak auto.""Admittedly, I recently considered competitor Ford Motor Company (NYSE:  ) a value trap when looking at  .But General Motors is different than Ford.A few weeks ago, Ford cut its guidance for next quarter, saying it expects weaker earnings. Conversely, GM recently said it expects its full-year earnings to be strong, between $6 and $6.50 per share. General Motors also guided for U.S. light-vehicle sales of 17.5 million units, down only slightly from last year's record 17.55 million units. While auto sales may not be growing like they have been over the past few years, it doesn't mean they're tanking either.The end result is GM pulling in cash like crazy while becoming outrageously undervalued.Unless the U.S. falls into a prolonged recession, it's likely that GM will continue to do well. If that's the case, its earnings and cash flow will be fine. That will justify the company's buyback and support its 4.5% dividend yield. Investors looking for a tactical entry could buy General Motors at the stock's 200-day moving average near $33. But considering GM trades for just 5.5 times next year's earnings, you don't really have to wait. 3.2% (NASDAQ:  ) specializes in payroll processing, human resources, insurance and other outsourcing solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses.It also become a  after its latest pullback.While the company beat earnings estimates at the end of March, revenues missed expectations. The CEO says the change in state and federal regulations has caused a pause in hiring. These comments came in late March, which were somewhat validated by the weak jobs report for the month.However, the CEO also said he expects hiring to pick up pace later in the year. Additionally, rate hikes from the Federal Reserve actually boost PAYX's bottom line. Increased confusion around regulations should also help the company's HR business. Although the pause in hiring has a negative impact in the short-term, it should be a benefit longer-term.Shares have pulled back toward support near $57.50, although the stock has broken below its 200-day moving average. Over the past year, these dips have not lasted long, and a rebound north of the 200-day MA seems likely.Even traders could consider buying PAYX for a short-term swing with defined support. But considering the stock's 3.2% yield, it makes for a solid investment - especially if jobs growth re-accelerates going forward. 3.2% (NYSE:  ) is another dividend stock that has irked some for its past transgressions, but it also should be on investors' go-to list regardless. GE has traded roughly flat over the past 12 months - a lull that's giving investors time to buy in while Wall Street catches up with the improving operational picture.General Electric was bogged down by regulations and sluggish growth tied to its financial banking business. But once the company spun off  (NYSE:  ) and made some other moves, it gained breathing room. Not only is SYF up 44% since the atypical spinoff, it's also up 18% over the past year. This alone has created plenty of value for shareholders who participated.Meanwhile, GE has been able to refocus its efforts on growth.The industrial giant is returning to its roots, putting its time and money back into aerospace, energy, power, water, healthcare and more. Not only do these businesses present better growth, but they also allow for higher margins.GE stock looks expensive at 33 times last year's earnings, but it's expected to grow earnings per share by 9.5% this year and 16.5% next. Thus, it only trades at 15 times 2018 EPS. And while revenues are forecast to grow just 1.3% this year, analysts are looking for sales to expand by 6.6% in 2018.I expect shares to lull over the next few months. But as investors start to look toward forward catalysts and the buyback picks up speed, GE could be one of the best dividend stocks that nobody (well,  ) saw coming. 5.9% (NYSE:  ) manages natural gas processing plants and transports natural gas and oil, among other businesses. And at a roughly 6% yield, this MLP should throw off enough in distributions to satisfy most income investors.These pipeline stocks are the type that investors own for the yield. But when buying high-quality properties, investors increase the odds that their investment will also generate a gain. EPD is one of  .First consider that in 2016, EPD recorded a roughly 15% drop in revenues. However, its net income was virtually unchanged, whiled its distributable cash flow actually increased.For 2017 and 2018, analysts expect roughly 12% sales growth. On the earnings front, forecasts call for 15.8% growth in 2017 and 11.5% growth in 2018. EPD can easily raise its dividend over the next few years, even if growth were to slow to a crawl.Throw in the relaxed regulatory environment, and the path forward for MLPs is about to become even easier.Love Trump or hate Trump, a pro-pipeline president is good for EPD. 4.4%In fact, the outlook for MLPs is so promising, we're including another high-quality pipeline operator -  (NYSE:  ).Like we said before, many investors are drawn to MLPs for their hefty payouts. But going with high-quality partnerships - even if their yields, like Magellan's, aren't as robust as EPD's - has many advantages. For starters, swoons in the energy market are better-weathered by these high-quality players. Second, when the storm comes, these are the companies most likely to maintain their lofty payouts (or at least not cut them by as much).Finally - and maybe this is an easy one - high-quality MLPs give investors the best chance at turning a profit. It may be tempting to chase a high yield of around 8% or 9%. But premium MLPs have more secure payouts and have a better chance at generating long-term gains.When it  . Its refined products segment (like gasoline) accounts for almost half its revenue and diversifies it away from oil. That's not to say oil isn't a valuable product to move via pipe. Instead, it gives Magellan a product mix that helps shield it from the ups and down of the oil market.As the U.S. becomes more dependent on domestic oil, that's sure to benefit MMP and other pipelines. But in a similar manner, as traveling picks up pace, that too will benefit Magellan and its refined products business.And not to sound like a broken record, but a pro-pipeline, pro-domestic-oil president gives MMP even more appeal. 4.9%Can you really talk about the best dividend stocks without mentioning  (NYSE:  )? Most income investors are plenty familiar with AT&T, what with its generous yield and a history of consistency.In fact, AT&T really is all about the dividend, which the company has paid through thick and thin. Over the past 30 years, T has increased its quarterly payout 12-fold and never skipped a payment.Naturally, there's not a ton of growth in what is a very saturated U.S. telecommunications market. Shares are up just 3% over the past 10 years, though a more respectable 31% over the past five. They're not monstrous gains, but throw in (conservatively) 400 basis points of annual performance in the dividend, and the returns start to look more impressive.The point is that buying AT&T isn't about squeezing out big-time capital gains. This is the quintessential slow-and-steady stock for the long term. Set it up as a DRIP stock or pocket the dividends each quarter. It's up to you.Don't give up on the idea of growth entirely, though. The acquisitions of  (NYSE:  ) and  are all meant to drive growth going forward. The wireless business is a good one. But given AT&T's conglomerate nature, management felt it was best to expand. With a $250 billion market cap, that meant M&A time.Despite the burdensome load of debt it used for these deals,  . Although investors wouldn't be faulted for waiting for a pullback in order to get a 5% yield. 4.8%You can't mention AT&T without talking about  (NYSE:  ). And while both stocks have many similarities - including their core business and near-5% yields - they do have important differences.For instance, while T has put together mega-deals for Time Warner and Dish, Verizon's M&A has been decidedly less exciting … on the surface.VZ acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015 and is in the process of buying  (NASDAQ:  ) for what should be roughly $4.5 billion. In a less-publicized deal, Verizon also acquired  for $2.4 billion in 2016. A combined total of $11.3 billion is nothing to sneeze at, though it's nothing compared to the $85 billion-plus AT&T spent on Time Warner, or the $48.5 billion it doled out for DirecTV.While Verizon is playing it conservatively (a plus for most dividend investors), there are a couple things to watch.First, remember that the Federal Reserve is trying to raise interest rates. Historically, rising rates are bad for dividend-paying stocks as they now have to ""compete"" against bonds for investors' dollars. Second,  (NASDAQ:  ) and others aren't making life easy. The unlimited data offers have forced VZ and T into the same game, which could hurt their margins in the short-term.But that doesn't mean you should avoid Verizon or AT&T. If anything, you should consider buying in chunks throughout the year, which will allow you to lower your cost basis on declines - and get yourself better yields on costs.One final note: Verizon is the exception to our rule in that analysts expect a slight decrease in earnings to 0.8%. But that's a trend that should reverse soon, and Verizon's dominant position in telecom makes it bulletproof regardless. 5%Here's a fun one (pun intended). (NYSE:  ) operates amusement parks (including thrill park Cedar Point), water parks and hotels around the country. It's a hot destination for families, teens and young adults and surely during students' summer break.And while FUN seems like fun and games, its financials are no joke. Net income soared in 2016, climbing to $177 million, up 58% from the $112 million in the year prior. As a result, earnings per share climbed 45% to $3.30 last year. But don't worry, a decline isn't in the forecast. Analysts expect Cedar Fair to grow earnings another 14% or so this year, then 7.8% growth in 2018. Revenues are expected to grow ~5% in 2017 and ~4% in 2018.Cedar Fair's valuation of around 18 times next year's earnings is a little less attractive. So here, I'd prefer waiting on a pullback before buying. Specifically, a 10% decline in shares would satisfy me from a value standpoint … and bump the yield up to 5.5% on cost.One note on timing: The stock tends to top around late spring to early summer. That doesn't mean FUN will tank without question, but it is something to be aware of. That's why, without a pullback, this one is hard to chase without better risk-reward.On a dip, though, FUN is one of my favorite dividend stocks to buy and hold. 3.4%Shares of  (NYSE:  ) are still 16% above their November lows. But the stock's recent 8% pullback has investors paying attention. It's hard to say which way it goes next, as MO sits right between its 50-day and 100-day moving averages.That doesn't mean we should avoid it, though. MO currently sports a 3.4% dividend yield and has been a consistent payer. Shares fell off a cliff in 2008. But over the past eight years, MO has climbed some 434% - and that doesn't include the dividend!Analysts expect MO to grow earnings 9% this year and 8% next year on 2.3% and 1.9% revenue growth, respectively. While somewhat un-extraordinary, the expectations are quite consistent. There are stocks to own for growth and there are stocks to own for consistency. MO fits the latter.However, just as smoking can be a turnoff in real life, it can be in investing too. Altria produces smokable products, smokeless products and wine. It's a tobacco stock and for some investors, that will make it a no-touch.Altria isn't for everybody, there's no fault or doubt in that. But if you can look through the smoke, investors will  . 4%When investors think of big oil, two names usually come to mind:  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). As goes oil, so goes Chevron.Admittedly, Chevron isn't the prettiest-looking stock in the world right now. But the company does have a few things going for it.For one, there are the charts -  sits between $102 and $105. That's about 5% away from current prices. However, if oil regains its mojo - and for the moment, it has - then this could propel CVX higher.  north of $120 if Chevron can pick up momentum and clear resistance. The two mostly go hand in hand. Still, if CVX can breakout from its downward trend, it could rally hard.More fundamentally, though, an oil company is one of the many likely to benefit in a world where regulations are falling left and right. The fact that its CEO is still looking at the Permian for more growth is good too.While admittedly buying Permian assets has definitely become more expensive, investors are sure to cheer a move into this region. Meanwhile, you have a comfortable 4% dividend to keep you in regular income.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The 11 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy@2017-04-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-11-best-dividend-stocks-to-buy-2017-04-10

Paychex's payroll service continues to perform well and the company continues to see better-than-expected demand for its human resource outsourcing services.The company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are encouraging. We consider that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.However, increased investment in new and innovative products, sluggish macroeconomic conditions and severe competition from other players in the space has made this sector a very tough one to be in for the short term.

 reported mixed results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein its bottom line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, the company registered improvement on both the counts.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 55 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and grew 10% year over year mainly on the back of higher revenues. On a GAAP basis, Paychex's earnings came in at 56 cents per share compared with the year-ago quarter figure of 50 cents.Paychex reported total revenue (including interest on funds held for clients) of $795.8 million, up 6% year over year. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) grew 6% year over year to $782.6 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $799 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 2% from the year-ago period to $446.6 million, primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base. However, the increase was tempered by approximately 1%, mainly due to one lesser processing day compared with the year-ago quarter.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 12% year over year to $336 million, chiefly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% on a year-over-year basis to $13.2 million, primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses were up 4% from the year-ago figure to $489.2 million due to higher wages and related expenses resulting from increased headcount in operations. However, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 61.5%.The company's operating income grew 10% year over year to $306.6 million. Paychex's operating margin expanded 70 bps to 38.5%.Net income came in at $202.5 million, up from $180.4 million reported last year. | Paychex exited the fiscal third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $403.9 million compared with $293 million at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. It generated operating cash flow of $769.3 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017.During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Paychex paid $496.9 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth $166.2 million.Paychex reiterated its fiscal 2017 outlook. Management still expects Payroll Service revenues to increase year over year in a range of 3-4%, while Human Resource Services revenues are anticipated to grow in a range of 12-14%. Total service revenue is estimated to increase in a range of 7-8%. However, Interest on funds held for its clients and investment income are now projected to grow in the upper-single-digit growth, up from the previous guidance of mid-single digit range.Net income is still likely to increase 7% year over year on a GAAP basis and 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Effective income tax rate is now anticipated to be 35%.In the fiscal third quarter, Paychex's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues missed the same. The stock was down in  . Notably, Paychex has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry on a year-to-date basis. The company has lost 1.5% year to date compared with the Outsourcing industry's gain of 0.3%.Nonetheless, the year-over-year improvement on both counts was encouraging. Moreover, the company's reiterated outlook for fiscal 2017 is praiseworthy, indicating that it is relatively well placed despite the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Furthermore, we are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansion initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support the long-term growth strategy.Product launches are likely to be the other growth drivers. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity  remain the primary concerns.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Broadcom Limited  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .The company, which designs, develops and supplies analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions, has a long-term EPS growth rate of 13.6%.

 is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 29. Last quarter, the payroll and human resource solutions provider posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.8%. Notably, over the past four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched the same on two occasions. This represents an average positive earnings surprise of 1.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on boosting sales force to drive revenues. We also believe that the company's expansion initiatives, including joint ventures and acquisitions, are in sync with its long-term growth strategy.One of the key secular growth drivers for Paychex is demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost-cutting potential. Moreover, growing regulatory burden on small companies underscores the increasing need for outsourcing non-core activities.The company continues to capitalize on this opportunity by regularly introducing products and services for upselling, and moving into the mid-market, which is anticipated to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.We are optimistic that Paychex might witness growth by successfully cross-selling newer products such as Paychex Premier, Major Market Services (MMS), and ancillary HRS products such as 401(k) record keeping, health insurance sales and workers' compensation administration to the existing client base. This strategy is likely to positively impact the company's fiscal third-quarter results.However, sluggish economic growth and a possible rise in interest rates remain concerns. Moreover, intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing Inc.  and Insperity could add to its woes. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 54 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:DISH Network Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.43%, and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .International Business Machines  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.43% and a Zacks Rank #3.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Monday, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.84), with the stock changing hands as low as $60.70 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Paychex Inc, looking at the history chart for PAYX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, PAYX makes up 2.77% of the First Trust RBA Quality Income ETF (Symbol: QINC) which is trading lower by about 0.2% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex (PAYX) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2017-03-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-payx-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2017-03-27

It's worth noting that while the Federal Reserve doesn't control interest rates directly, its policies have an almost immediate impact on other interest-sensitive assets, such as credit card APRs and mortgage rates.Image source: Getty Images.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had all the reasons it needed to lift its federal funds target rate, according to Fed Chair Janet Yellen: an expanding labor market, the firming of business fixed investments, and an upward move in inflation in recent quarters toward its long-term goal of 2%, excluding food and energy. The FOMC stood by its long-term goal of moving the federal funds target rate to 3% in the years to come.The purpose of the Fed's move is to ensure that the U.S. economy doesn't overheat. Leaving its federal funds target rate low for too long could lead to bouts of high inflation, which has historically proved to be bad for the U.S. economy and investors.Some industries and groups of people are clearly going to be excited about the Fed's decision to increase its fed funds target rate. Probably standing at the front of the pack with the champagne are banks and credit unions. A 25-basis-point increase allows banks to pass along higher fees on variable loans and credit cards. Meanwhile, they pass along yield increases on a much slower basis when it comes to interest earned on savings account. In short, it means banks should see their net interest margins increase.For example,  's(NYSE: BAC) 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission following its third-quarter report signaled that it could earn $5.3 billion more in net interest income if long-term and short-term interest rates rose by 100 basis points. Since that estimate, we've seen two 25-basis-point increases from the Fed. When factoring in Bank of America's shrinking costs via branch closures, each quarter-point hike in interest rates could mean $0.10 or more in annual EPS gets added to B of A's bottom line.Image source: Getty Images.Payroll processors are another group that'll be thrilled with the rate hike. A giant in the field like  (NASDAQ: PAYX) , which has already been benefiting from steady employment growth, gets a separate benefit in terms of higher short-term yields. Paychex earns investment income on its float - essentially the money it receives from companies that's paid out to employees. This money isn't paid out the day it's received, giving Paychex time to earn interest on this large pool of cash. Higher interest rates mean more investment income for Paychex and payroll service providers.Even seniors should be doing the happy dance in light of the Fed's move. While it's unlikely to do much for savings accounts, it could provide a nice yield boost to CDs and bonds. Additionally, since the Social Security Trust's more than $2.8 trillion in spare cash is  from the U.S. government, a higher rate environment could begin yielding more in interest income for the trust.However, the Fed's rate hike also comes with some staggering costs for millions of Americans, and the U.S. government.According to WalletHub, the 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate is expected to lead to $1.6 billion in added finance charges this year for the 157 million Americans who carry a balance on their credit cards. The analysis further broke this figure down to an extra $14 per quarter for each household. That may not sound like a lot ($56 more per household, annually), but we're still early on in the rate-hike cycle. By year's end, we could be looking at a $42 increase per quarter, or $168 for the year, per household, if the Fed holds to Wall Street's consensus and hikes rates three times. That's no longer chump change.Image source: Getty Images.Most mortgages tend to be of the fixed-rate variety, so a Fed rate hike is of no consequence. But prospective homebuyers, and those with variable rates, could feel the pain. For example, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen by 88 basis points since hitting a record low of 3.50% in December 2012. This extra 88 basis points over 30 years on a home loan of $200,000 means you're paying an extra $36,400 over the life of the loan in interest, assuming no early repayment.But the real jaw-dropper comes from the federal government, which is nearly $20 trillion in debt. According to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, each 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates is expected to add $1.6 trillion to the 10-year budget deficit. It's worth pointing out that most of these costs are back-loaded, with $262 billion of these costs coming out in the 10th year as costs and borrowing accelerate. The CBO figures that borrowing will increase to $30 trillion from $20 trillion a decade from now.Breaking this down further, Wednesday's rate hike equates to about a $400 billion increase in the 10-year federal budget deficit. With three rate hikes anticipated in 2017, we're talking about an estimated $1.2 trillion being added to the federal budget deficit over the next decade. These quarter-point hikes, while necessary to control inflation, can prove devastating to a federal balance sheet that's already drowning in debt.We may tend to overlook a 0.25% hike in interest rates as trivial, but these added costs suggest it's far from inconsequential.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"e are still three weeks away from the Q1 earnings season ramping up, but the reporting cycle has gotten underway already with earnings reports from 12 S&P 500 members already out. All of these initial Q1 earnings reports are from companies that have their fiscal quarters ending in February, which form part of our Q1 earnings tally.The chart below shows the weekly reporting calendar for the S&P 500 index, with this week bringing in results from 5 index members. (  ) - Red Hat reports after the market's close on Monday, March 27th, with the company expected to earn 39 cents per share on $618.5 million in revenues, up +14.4% and +13.8% from the year-earlier level, respectively. The stock was down big after the last earnings report on December 21st, but has impressive gains this year - up +19.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Tech sector's +8.9% gain (the S&P 500 index is up +4.7% in that same time period). (  ) - Darden reports results before the market's open on Tuesday, March 28th, with company expected to earn $1.27 per share on $1.86 billion in revenues, up +5.8% and +1% from the year-earlier period, respectively. The company's improved comp and margin outlook has helped the stock outperform the broader market as well as the peer restaurant industry, with the stock up +5.6% in the year-to-date period vs. a decline of -1.2% for the Zacks Restaurants industry. The last two earnings reports were not big movers of the stock, but this report could be material given the stock's strong recent gains. (  ) is another restaurant operator reporting results on Tuesday, March 28th. This is a relatively young player, having gone public only in the fall of 2014, with the stock up an impressive +251% since the October 2014 IPO on the back of the company's strong growth profile. Dave & Buster's shares are up +7.8% in the year-to-date period vs. -1.2% decline for the Zacks Restaurants industry. The last few earnings reports were big stock price movers, with the stock up big following the December quarter report when it beat on the top- and bottom lines. (  ) - Payroll processor Paychex reports results before the market's open on Wednesday, March 29th. The company is expected to earn $0.54 per share on $798.4 million in revenues, up +7.6% on +6.1% higher revenues from the year-earlier period, respectively.Total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +6.4% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues. This would follow +7.3% earnings growth in 2016 Q4 on +4.7%, the highest growth pace in all most two years.Estimates for Q1 have come down as the quarter has unfolded, with the current +6.4% growth down from +10.4% at the end of December. The chart below shows how Q1 earnings growth expectations have evolved over the last three months.Please note that while Q1 estimates have followed well traversed path that we have been seeing consistently over the last few years, the magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other periods, particularly in the first half of last year and all of 2015. In other words, Q1 estimates have come down, but they haven't come down by as much.The table below shows the summary picture for Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q4.Please note that the Q1 earnings season would follow the strong showing on the earnings front in the preceding reporting cycle. Not only did 2016 Q4 growth reach the highest in two years, but total earnings for the quarter also reached a new quarterly record. The strong Q4 performance came after the first positive earnings growth in 2016 Q3, having declined in each of the preceding 5 quarters, as the chart below of year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 index shows.The chart below shows the Q1 earnings growth contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to ramp up in 2017.The market is reflecting this improved earnings backdrop as the chart below of the S&P 500 relative to forward 12-month Zacks Consensus estimates shows.Please note that the earnings backdrop has not changed in any meaningful way since the November elections, notwithstanding the market's strong gains since then. The only exception to this comment is the Finance sector whose earnings outlook has improved as a result of the uptrend in interest rates since November 8th. It is reasonable to expect that earnings estimates will move favorably once the new administration's growth-friendly policies get enacted. For now, however, estimates are following the long-established trend of coming down.If you'd like to see specific recommendations to capitalize on current market conditions, there is a way you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@USMV, ADP, BDX, PAYX: Large Outflows Detected at ETF@2017-01-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/usmv-adp-bdx-payx-large-outflows-detected-etf-2017-01-30

"nvestors in Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PAYX options chain for the new April 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of 80 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PAYX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $59.26/share today.Because the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.39% return on the cash commitment, or 8.76% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of PAYX stock at the current price level of $59.26/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.10% if the stock gets called away at the April 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PAYX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.86% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.69% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 16%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 17%.

"hen Warren Buffett is looking for strong companies to invest in, he employs both qualitative and quantitative tests to find the best candidates. Durable competitive advantage and strong management are among the key qualitative measures, and a go-to quantitative metric in the Oracle's arsenal is return-on-equity.The formula for ROE is simple-net income divided by shareholder's equity (total assets minus total liabilities)-and tells an investor how much cash a company is generating from its existing base of assets. For example, if the ROE is 15%, then 15 cents of assets are created for every dollar originally invested. A steadily increasing ROE is a clue that management is putting its investors' capital to good use.One Forbes columnist characterizes ROE as ""a speed limit on a firm's growth rate"" because a company can't grow its earnings at a rate above its ROE without borrowing funds or selling more shares. In a 2007 paper that addresses the measurement and implications of ROE, NYU Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran writes, ""We can safely conclude that the key number in a valuation is not the cost of capital that we assign a firm but the return earned on capital that we attribute to it."" Note: Return-on-capital includes debt as well as equity in the calculation.Buffett looks for companies with ROE of above 15 percent in each of the past ten years. He sees this as an indication that management has done a good job allocating retained earnings for the benefit of the shareholders. He doesn't stop there, however. Because some companies can be financed with debt that far exceeds equity, they can also show a consistently high ROE yet still be unattractive from a valuation standpoint. So, Buffett also requires 10-year average return-on-total capital, which includes both equity and debt, to be at least 12 percent.From an investor's standpoint, an attractive stock will offer a high ROE as well as a favorable dividend yield (annual dividends-per-share divided by price-per-share), which measures how much cash flow an investor is getting for each dollar invested-the ""bang for your buck"". Economist and quant investor James O'Shaughnessy, a guru that inspired one of my stock screening models, viewed dividend yield as an essential metric when evaluating large companies. He found that market-leaders with high dividends tended to outperform during bull markets and didn't fall as far as other stocks during bear markets. He also found that high dividend payouts were a good predictor of success for this group of companies. John Neff, a bargain-hunting guru who managed the Windsor fund for over 30 years, also focused his attention on dividends. He argued that while stock prices are subject to the whims of the market, solid companies rarely cut their dividends.Using my stock screening model inspired by the investment philosophy of Warren Buffett, I have identified the following four high-scoring stocks based on ROE and dividend yield: is a manufacturer and seller of integrated circuits and semiconductors and earns high marks from our Warren Buffett-based stock screening model due to its earnings predictability and ability to pay off its debt ($4.79 billion) with earnings ($9.69 billion) within two years. Average return-on-equity over the past ten years of 21.2% well exceeds the preferred range of 15%. Free cash flow-per-share of $0.92 indicates that the company is generating more cash than it is consuming, a plus under this strategy, and management's use of retained earnings reflects a favorable return of 59.7%. TSM also earns a high score from our Peter Lynch-based investment methodology due to its ratio of price-earnings to growth in earnings-per-share (PEG ratio) of 0.69 (required to be under 1.0 to pass). Total debt-equity is favorable at 17.76%. is engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. The company passes our Buffett-inspired stock screening model due to its stable and expanding earnings-per-share and its ability to pay off debt ($2.34 billion) with earnings ($1.20 billion) within two years. Average return-on-equity for the past ten years of 17.7% exceeds the 15% minimum requirement, as does the same ratio for the past three years (which averaged 20.2%). Shares outstanding have decreased over the past five years, indicating that management has been using excess capital to increase shareholder value-a plus under this model. is a provider of integrated human capital management (  ) solutions for payroll, human resource, retirement and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses in the U.S. Our Buffett-inspired stock screen likes the company's earnings predictability and its consistently higher-than-average return-on-total capital over the past ten years of 36% (compared to the minimum requirement of 12%). Management's use of retained earnings reflects a return of 24.7%, favored under this strategy, and the debt-free balance sheets adds appeal. is a telecommunications and technology company that gets a thumb's up from our Buffett-based screen for its earnings predictability and favorable average return-on-equity of 29.0% over the past ten years (versus the minimum requirement of 15%), a level which has been maintained over the past three years as well. Management's use of retained earnings reflects a return of 19.4%, which adds appeal.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Four High-Quality Stocks with 3% Dividend Yields@2017-01-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/four-high-quality-stocks-3-dividend-yields-2017-01-23

"Image source: Glassdoor.comThat's crucial, because Paycom's sales force is the key to its future. Consider: most companies have a payroll provider that they've been using for years. Because of the aforementioned high switching costs, these companies don't want to switch over to Paycom unless they have a  reason to.That's where Paycom's sales force comes in -- they have to wow HR departments enough to convince them that switching over is worth the headache. And that's why I'll continue to watch the Glassdoor reviews, as well as continue to make sure Richardson is running the company with his skin in the game.Finally, I think it's crucial to invest in companies that don't rely too heavily on any one customer. With Paycom, no one customer accounts for more than half of 1% of all sales. That means that if any one customer decides to leave Paycom, it doesn't necessarily mean that it would make a significant dent in Paycom's prospects.The company has also been able to continue growing its cash hoard while not taking on copious levels of debt.You won't find that at every Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company out there -- and it sets Paycom apart.

Also, on a year-over-year basis, the company registered improvement on both the counts. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 56 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and grew 8% year over year mainly on the back of higher revenues.Paychex reported total revenue (including interest on funds held for clients) of $771.4 million, up 7% year over year. Moreover, the company's reiterated outlook for fiscal 2017 is encouraging, indicating that it is relatively well placed despite the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Furthermore, we are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansion initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support the long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to be the other growth drivers. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.Paychex is a cash rich company with a strong balance sheet.

"The best way to start the New Year off on the right foot is by purchasing high-quality and allowing them to go to work for you over the long-term. Dividend stocks have historically left non-dividend-paying stocks in the dust over the long run, and companies that pay dividends often have time-tested business models that serve as beacons to attract investors hungry for added income.Image source: Getty Images.The best way to start the New Year off on the right foot is by purchasing high-quality  and allowing them to go to work for you over the long-term. Dividend stocks have historically left non-dividend-paying stocks in the dust over the long run, and companies that pay dividends often have time-tested business models that serve as beacons to attract investors hungry for added income.So which dividend stocks should you consider buying in January? That's a question we posed to a diverse set of Foolish contributors. The dividend stocks they settled on include  (NASDAQ: PAYX) ,  (NYSE: PNC) ,  (NYSE: TNH) ,  (NYSE: BIP) , and  (NYSE: UTX) . (  ): The one dividend stock that comes to mind for me, a stock which has nearly everything working in its favor, is payroll and human resource solutions provider Paychex.To begin with, Paychex is benefiting from unemployment rates hitting more than a nine-year low. The recently released November jobs report showed an unemployment rate of just 4.6%, which is well within the Fed's targeted unemployment range. The more people who are employed, in theory, the more active Paychex will be with small- and medium-sized businesses. It's a company that relies on a strong economy to drive growth.Image source: Getty Images.Secondly, Paychex looks poised to benefit from a number of Donald Trump's policy proposals. Trump's plan to boost infrastructure spending and lower corporate income tax rates from 35% to 15% could easily mean more money in the pockets of businesses; and this could lead to even more hiring. Also, if Trump is able to pass legislation for a corporate tax holiday for overseas cash, the repatriated capital may be put to work to boost employment. A lower corporate tax rate would also be a positive for Paychex, which had an effective income tax of 33% during Q1 2017.Paychex is also receiving a boost from the Federal Reserve, which just raised the federal funds target rate for only the second time in a decade this December. Usually, higher interest rates are bad news for most consumers and businesses, but not for Paychex. Paychex can earn interest income over the short-term period between when it receives cash from the businesses it deals with and when it cuts paychecks to the employees of those businesses. The higher interest rates go, the more interest income Paychex will be able to generate on its short-term float.Sporting a 3% yield, Paychex could continue to fly high in January and beyond. , CFA (  ): The stock market has registered an impressive run in the short period following the presidential election of Republican Donald J. Trump. Under a Trump Administration, investors expect lower taxes, less regulation, and a $1 billion infrastructure plan -- and each could be positive for equity investments. However, I think it's important to temper the ""animal spirits"" until we receive more concrete details. In reality, it's likely the Trump Administration will fall short of expectations on one plan -- and possibly all three -- at least in the short term. Additionally, a few of Trump's economic ideas appear negative for investors, like import tariffs and other anti-free trade provisions that investors seem to be ignoring in the ""Trump Rally.""One sector that has been rallying post-election is financials. However, I feel this sector will continue to push higher, even taking into account a ""trust, but verify"" approach to the next administration. While the financial media has mostly focused on the run-up in stocks, there has been a rout in the Treasury markets. The chart below shows the yield curve, which is the yield across various maturities, between the day before Trump's election and this writing:Data source: Treasury.gov. Chart and table by Jamal Carnette.As you see above, yields are up across all maturities. More importantly, however, is the fact that yields have increased more for longer maturities than shorter ones. This steepening of the yield curve is great news for banks that are in the business of lending at longer maturities and borrowing from depositors at the shorter ones. Even if regulatory and tax reform are delayed, financials should immediately benefit from the shift in the yield curve.PNC Financial is a strong dividend stock to buy in this environment. While the recent stock run has pushed its dividend yield down to 1.9%, PNC has a strong record of dividend increases. After passing the Federal Reserve's stress test, PNC increased its per-share dividend payout nearly 8% over last year's total and committed up to $2 billion in share buybacks in the fourth quarter, and has increased its per share dividend payout nearly 60% in five years. PNC Financial is suited to outperform as a dividend investment in this environment, and won't require an act of Congress (or the new administration) to do so. (  ): Here's the thing when buying companies in commodities: You're never going to be able to call the exact bottom and get things just right. In reality, though, you don't have to. You're much better off finding a company than can do reasonably well even when times are tough in the industry. If weakness in that market lasts longer than expect, then at least you can be comfortable with modest returns until the market does pick up.Image source: Getty Images.This is why Terra Nitrogen Company looks compelling to me as an investment for January and headed into 2017. Terra Nitrogen is a manufacturer of ammonium nitrate and urea, two nitrogen-based fertilizers. It is uniquely positioned because it is a variable rate master limited partnership that pays out all available cash at the end of each quarter. Even though it only has one factory as an asset, it also has no debt and generates strong returns even during tough times in the market. Even last quarter when urea prices were at their lowest in a dozen years, Terra Nitrogen produced a 30% net income margin.The nitrogen market is in a tough spot right now, as demand has been weak and cheap US natural gas has introduced a lot of new fertilizer plants that use natural gas as a feedstock -- the lowest cost method out there today. Luckily, Terra Nitrogen is out in front of these trends, and is one of the low cost producers. I can't put a timeline on it, but eventually higher cost production will get cut out of the market, and prices will likely rise when that happens. Even if it takes a long time, though, Terra Nitrogen will do just fine and throw off large amounts of cash to shareholders. (  ): Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is a publicly traded limited partnership that owns a variety of infrastructure assets sprinkled all around the world. This includes toll roads In Brazil, cellular towers in France, shipping ports in Australia, and much, much more.Brookfield's goal is to buy one-of-a-kind infrastructure assets that crank out cash flow and are nearly impossible to reproduce, thereby proving the company with stable and recurring profits. Management then returns that cash flow to investors in the form of a distribution, which is partnership speak for dividend.Image source: Getty Images.This operating formula has worked like magic. Since being spun out of  in 2009, the company's funds from operation have compounded at 34% annually. That's allowed the company to increase its payout by 12% each year and still have plenty of capital leftover to invest in growing the business.Management believes that Brookfield's assets should allow the company to grow its distribution by 5% to 9% annually over the long term. That's an attractive growth rate for a company that currently yield 4.6%, making this a great stock for dividend investors to consider buying today. (  ): Investors know what they're going to get with United Technologies: an extremely balanced and diversified company that consistently outperforms the market when it comes to returning value to shareholders.Image source: United Technologies December investor presentation.United Technologies can essentially be split into four entities. Pratt & Whitney manufactures engines for both commercial airplanes as well as the military, while UTC Aerospace Systems makes landing gear, brakes, interior products and flight control systems. Closer to the ground, United Technologies and its Otis company is the world's largest elevator manufacturer and sells a slew of other products to residential and commercial buildings.But just listing its divisions and product offerings doesn't do its diversified business justice. Consider that it makes about 44% of its net sales from reoccurring and high-margin aftermarket products, while the other 56% is generated from OEM sales. Also, its commercial & industrial business generates 52% of net sales, while commercial aerospace and military aerospace generate the other 48%. It even generates this pretty evenly across the globe, with 38% generated in the U.S., 27% in Europe, 20% in Asia, and 15% in other regions.In terms of a growth story, United Technologies expects worldwide urbanization and economic growth to fuel its commercial building business. It also estimates that revenue passenger miles will move from 3.1 trillion in 2010 to 5.4 trillion in 2020, before jumping to 9.1 trillion in 2030 -- which spells good things for its aerospace business. For investors looking for a diversified global conglomerate with upside, and a dividend yield of 2.36% with consistent annual raises, United Technologies is definitely worth a look in 2017.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" reported mixed results for second-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein its bottom line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, the company registered improvement on both the counts.The company reported earnings per share of 56 cents which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and grew 8% year over year mainly on the back of higher revenues.Paychex reported total revenue (including interest on funds held for clients) of $771.4 million, up 7% year over year. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $779 million. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) grew 7% year over year to $760 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 3% from the year-ago period to $440.9 million, primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base. The acquisition of Advanced Partners contributed approximately 1% to the segment's revenue growth.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 12% year over year to $319.1 million, mainly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.4 million, primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses increased 8% from the year-ago figure to $460.3 million due to higher wages and related expenses resulting from increased headcount in operations. Moreover, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased 40 basis points (bps) to 59.7%.The company's operating income grew 6% year over year to $311.1 million. However, Paychex's operating margin contracted 40 bps to 40.3%.Net income came in at $202.1 million or 56 cents, up from $189.2 million or 52 cents reported last year. | Paychex exited the fiscal second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $293 million compared with $497.7 million at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. The company generated operating cash flow of $413.4 million in the first half of fiscal 2017.During the first six months of fiscal 2017, Paychex paid $331.5 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth $166.2 million.Paychex reiterated its fiscal 2017 outlook. Management still expects Payroll Service revenues to increase year over year in a range of 3% to 4% while Human Resource Services revenues are expected to grow in a range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is expected to increase in a range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for its clients and investment income are projected to grow in the mid-single digit range.Net income is still likely to increase 7% year over year on a GAAP basis and 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Effective income tax rate is now anticipated to be 35%.In the fiscal second quarter, Paychex's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.

" is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 21. Last quarter, the payroll and human resource solutions provider posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.3%. Notably, in the past four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched the same on two occasions. This represents an average positive earnings surprise of 1.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are slightly cautious about Paychex's near-term prospects as the company's business may be affected by the prevailing weak economic conditions as employment levels tend to decline and interest rates may become more volatile.Lower or falling interest rates generally cause Paychex's float income to decline. These conditions may have an adverse effect on Paychex's business owing to lower transaction volumes or loss of clients.Potential clients tend to lower their overall spending on payroll and other outsourcing services. We believe that this will cause Paychex to come under pressure, thereby reducing revenue growth potential in the future.Moreover, intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing Inc.  and Insperity could add to its woes.Nonetheless, Paychex's sustained investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to drive revenue growth are positive. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, support its long-term growth strategy. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Western Digital Corporation  with Earnings ESP of +16.8% and a Zacks Rank #1.

DP (  ) has reported 7% annual growth in revenues over the last few years, fueled by higher demand for HR outsourcing and services in that period. HR outsourcing revenues have grown in the mid-teens over the last few years, driven by strong demand for HR outsourcing and related services. Comparatively, payroll processing revenues have witnessed moderate single-digit growth in the same period, as shown below. Low interest rates led revenues from interest on client funds to decline on a year-over-year basis - a trend which could reverse in the future.According to our estimates, Payroll Processing forms around of our $39 billion valuation for ADP. The Client Funds Interest segment makes up around 30% of ADP's valuation, and the HR Outsourcing segment makes up roughly 11%. Below we take a look at why we maintain  , which is around 10-12% lower than the current market price.Keeping up the trend from previous years, much of the growth was attributable to HR outsourcing and other services (or PEO services), which grew at 16% for fiscal year 2016 (ended June) to just under $3.1 billion. ADP's comprehensive scope of services - including health and welfare benefits services, compliance services, 401k retirement savings plans and worker insurance services for small and medium enterprises - has helped its HR Outsourcing & Services division grow rapidly. Correspondingly, the total number of worksite employees under ADP's HR division has increased at a CAGR of almost 13% from 2010 through 2015. Similarly, the company reported an almost 12% increase in its total worksite employees to 432,000 by the end of June.Comparatively, ADP's payroll processing revenues increased by 4% for the full year, as the company has witnessed a steady 2-3% increase in its payroll clients over the last few years - a trend which continued in 2016 as well. The increase in payroll clients was complemented by a modest 1% price increase leading to a 4% annual growth in revenues.According to our estimates, ADP's adjusted EBITDA margin stood at just under 21% in 2015, and has improved slightly in 2016. It should be noted that the key contributor to the EBITDA growth was the corresponding increase in revenue, while the impact of changes in operating expenses is negligible for ADP, as shown below.Over the next few years, we forecast ADP to sustain revenue growth in Payroll Processing & HR Outsourcing, as shown below. We forecast mid-single digit growth in Payroll Processing revenues. (Read:  ) Additionally, ADP's HR Outsourcing and Other Services segment should continue to witness strength in its service offerings. We forecast ADP's total worksite employees to continue to increase, albeit at a slower pace, to over 650,000 employees by 2022 .In addition to the segments mentioned above, ADP could witness strong growth in its Client Funds Interest segment if interest rates pick up in coming years. The Fed has indicated that another interest rate hike is likely in the near term. Since the operating expenses of the Client Funds Interest segment are fixed in nature, revenue growth directly translates to an improvement in margins. As a result, the company-wide EBITDA could grow at a faster pace than revenue growth as shown below.You can modify the interactive charts in this note to gauge how a change in worksite employees, number of payroll customers or fee charged per client can have on our price estimate for ADP. .View Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis): Global Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid CapThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Is ADP's Stock Overvalued?@2016-12-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adps-stock-overvalued-2016-12-09

"s small and mid-size businesses grow, they tend to offer additional HR benefits to help attract and retain talented employees. This creates challenges for HR teams and employees alike as new benefits often require the adoption of additional software products that usually do not communicate with legacy systems. 's(NYSE: PAYC) solution to this problem is to combine payroll processing and other HR functions into a single system. The company's cloud-based software has proven to be a hit with customers, allowing Paycom to steal market share away from legacy payroll processing companies like  and  for years.Coming into Tuesday's third-quarter earnings report, Wall Street was expecting that Paycom would continue its winning ways and drive double-digit growth in its top and bottom lines. Let's put the company's actual results under a microscope to see how it performed in the period.Image source: GettyData source: Paycom Software. YOY = year over year.For comparison, management had previously guided for third-quarter revenue to be in the range of $75 million to $77 million and for adjusted EBITDA to land between $13 million and $15 million, so the reported figures represent a beat on both metrics. The company's numbers also bested Wall Street's expectations for the period.Paycom founder and CEO Chad Richinson was quite happy with his company's quarterly performance, noting that the ""Paycom solution continues to remain top-of-mind with C-suite and HR leaders across the country.""He also stated, ""We continue to drive value for our clients -- with our best-in-class, single-database payroll and human capital management solution -- and also for our shareholders by repurchasing over 525,000 shares over the past five months under our stock repurchase plan.""Management believes that the strong growth rates will continue into the fourth quarter. The company is guiding for total revenue to be in the range of $85 million to $87 million, the midpoint of which represents growth of 32% year over year. That's right in line with analysts' expectations.Paycom also believes that its business will continue to scale, calling for adjusted EBITDA to land between $14 million and $16 million. That represents 43% growth over the year-ago period at the midpoint.Despite posting strong quarterly results and issuing an upbeat forecast, shares of Paycom were down by 17% at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday. While it is hard to pinpoint the exact reason for the decline, it is possible that some traders felt that the company's valuation was getting out of hand. Prior to this earnings release, shares of Paycom had rallied more than 30% year to date, pushing its trailing price-to-earnings ratio above 80. Perhaps some traders went into profit-taking mode given the company's strong year-to-date performance.Regardless of the short-term price movement, Paycom's third-quarter results clearly show that its single-database offering continues to resonate with customers. As long as the company can continue to win market share and grow revenue and profits at above-average rates, then its future is likely to remain bright.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"Image and data source: GlassdoorOf course, a company can't be run for the employees' benefit alone. There needs to be added value that Paycom's platform offers. For proof of that, I point both to the company's rapid revenue and customer account growth.Data source: SEC filingsIt's also worth noting that Paycom's customer retention rate -- for those who have been using the product for over three years -- has remained strong: 91% every year for the past three years.But perhaps the most important part of this equation is the company's sustainable competitive advantage: its high switching costs.No one wants to spend their precious time at work worrying about payroll...or any of the other things included in Paycom's HR domain. While it  be dealt with, rarely does such a focus do much to guarantee that a company will actually fulfill its mission.To add to the headache, once a company is trained on a new platform, it can take a long time to retrain everyone on a new system. That's why Paycom's advantages are two-fold: (1) by integrating several HR functions on one platform, lots of time is saved; and (2) once a company becomes locked in, it would be loath to switch to a competitor unless service or price became significant issues.While some might fret over the price tag of 54 times earnings -- which, no doubt, is expensive -- I'm comforted by the strength of this moat. Additionally, if Paycom hits its 2017 and 2018 EPS targets, it is trading for just 41 and 33 times those figures, respectively.While there will obviously be risks emerging from competition, there's another danger I want to address here. On Glassdoor, there was a particularly honest and thorough review that pointed out the biggest problem the company may face moving forward: that it is simply growing too fast to meet customer needs.The reviewer wrote that, ""As a sales rep...you are also required to set the system up for your clients...You are told that a Transition Specialist to help you through [it]...but they are so overwhelmed with their workload,"" that they can't do it all. To me, this means that management might be chasing growth to satisfy investors over the short-term, instead of focusing on creating a healthy company for the long-run.Only time will tell which path management will choose; I'm certainly hoping for the latter. In the mean time, I'm comfortable opening a small starter position in Paycom to see how it all plays out.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

" (  ) is a rare bird these days - a fast-growing vendor of cloud-based applications that's also quite profitable.In this case, Oklahoma City-based Paycom has managed to make its mark providing payroll processing and human capital management software in an integrated offering to U.S. companies.Paycom stock has been a big winner this year, with shares up 30% so far in 2016. Its stock ended trading Thursday down fractionally to 48.75. It went public at 15 in April 2014.""The company has consistently outperformed expectations, is expected to grow well over 40% in 2016, and is nicely profitable - a rare combination in the cloud software space,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst David Hynes said in a recent note to clients. He rates Paycom stock as a buy with a price target of 55.[ibdchart symbol=""PAYC"" type=""daily"" size=""threequarter"" position=""rightchart"" ]Paycom focuses mostly on small and midsize companies with 50 to 2,000 workers for its software-as-a-service. That keeps it under the radar of larger firms such as payroll-processing leader  (  ) and cloud-based human resources software provider  (  ).Still, ADP is considered to be among its main rivals, along with  (  ),  (  ) and  (ULTI), RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a note to clients. He rates Paycom stock as sector perform with a price target of 54.While most providers of payroll and HR software tick off all the necessary boxes for functionality, Paycom excels in several ways, MacMillan said.For starters, its software is based off a core system of records maintained in a single database. Since the Paycom software is essentially a single application, it is easier for administrators to manage, MacMillan points out.""We believe our success is due to the growing recognition of the benefits that can be gained from Paycom's single database architecture,"" Paycom Chief Executive Chad Richison said on a conference call with analysts on Aug. 2.Paycom's software also is sold directly to customers through agents in regional sales offices.""Paycom has a very clear playbook for driving growth by adding customers and by increasing the average recurring revenue per customer,"" MacMillan's report says.Its customer growth strategy is based on expanding its sales organization through new regional offices across the U.S. Paycom has 42 sales offices now with line of sight to about 124 possible offices, MacMillan said.""We are still in the early stages of a multiyear mission to gain market share and grow into one of the largest providers of cloud-based payroll and human capital management software,"" Richison said.MacMillan believes Paycom can grow its sales by 25% or more for the next three years by adding new customers and increasing revenue per customer.HR management today is all about regulatory compliance and benefits, so Paycom and the industry benefit when the government imposes new employee rules on companies.For instance, Paycom has gotten a boost from selling software to help companies comply with the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare.The company also recently released a tool kit to comply with changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act, allowing customers to make strategic decisions related to new overtime pay regulations.Another area for compliance involves meeting diversity requirements.Paycom says it helps companies effectively navigate a rapidly changing business environment. Its software is designed to manage employees from recruitment through retirement.The market for cloud and outsourced payroll processing and related human capital management services is worth about $25 billion to $30 billion a year in the U.S. and is growing in the high single digits, MacMillan said.""We think Paycom can address up to $14 billion of the payroll/HCM market,"" MacMillan said.

DP (  ) is scheduled to reported its fiscal Q1 2017 earnings on November 2.

" reported impressive results for first-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein its top and bottom lines both came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.The company reported earnings per share (""EPS"") of 60 cents which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents and grew 3% year over year mainly on the back of higher revenues.Paychex reported total revenue (including interest on funds held for clients) of $785.5 million, up 9% year over year. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $782 million. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) grew 9% year over year to $773.5 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 4% from the year-ago period to $450.9 million, primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base. The acquisition of Advanced Partners contributed approximately 1% to the segment's revenue growth.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 15% year over year to $322.6 million, mainly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% on a year-over-year basis to $12 million, primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses increased 8% from the year-ago figure to $462.5 million due to 6% rise in compensation-related expenditure. However, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 10 basis points (bps) to 58.9%.Consequently, Paychex's operating margin expanded 10 bps to 41.1%. In dollar terms, reported operating income increased 9% year over year to $323 million.Net income came in at $217.4 million or 60 cents, up from $209.1 million or 58 cents reported last year. | Paychex exited fiscal first quarter 2017 with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $497.7 million compared with $352.1 million at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. The company generated operating cash flow of $294.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.During the quarter, Paychex paid $166.3 million as dividend.Paychex updated some aspects of its fiscal 2017 outlook. Management now expects Payroll Service revenues to increase year over year in the range of 3% to 4%. Earlier, it projected growth of 4%.Net income is now likely to increase 7% year over year, down from earlier guidance of 8%. Effective income tax rate is now anticipated to be 35%. The previous forecast was in the range of 35.5% to 36%.Other aspects of the earlier guidance remain unchanged. The company continues to anticipate Human Resource Services revenues growth in the range of 12-14%. Total service revenue is likely to increase 7%-8%. Interest on funds held for its clients and investment income are projected to grow in the mid-single-digit range.In the fiscal first quarter of 2017, both earnings and revenues beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company's updated outlook for fiscal 2017 remains more or less encouraging, indicating that it is relatively well placed despite the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Furthermore, we are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to be the other growth drivers. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity  remain the primary concerns.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Among the largest underlying components of USMV, in trading today Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is up about 1.1%, General Mills, Inc.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@USMV, PAYX, GIS, ED: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2016-09-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/usmv-payx-gis-ed-large-inflows-detected-etf-2016-09-22
 is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28. Last quarter, the payroll and human resource solutions provider's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In the past four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched the same on two occasions. This represents an average positive earnings surprise of 0.98%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | We are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on boosting sales force to drive revenues. We also believe that the company's expansion initiatives, including joint ventures and acquisitions, are in sync with its long-term growth strategy.One of the key secular growth drivers for Paychex is demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost-cutting potential. Moreover, growing regulatory burden on small companies underscores the increasing need for outsourcing non-core activities.The company continues to capitalize on this opportunity by regularly introducing new products and services for upselling and moving into the mid-market, which should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.Going further, we are optimistic that Paychex might witness growth by successfully cross-selling newer products such as Paychex Premier, Major Market Services (MMS) and ancillary HRS products such as 401(k) record keeping, health insurance sales and workers' compensation administration to the existing client base. This strategy is likely to positively impact the company's fiscal first-quarter results.However, sluggish economic growth and a possible rise in interest rates remain concerns. Moreover, intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing Inc.  and Insperity could add to its woes.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 57 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Actuant Corporation  with Earnings ESP of +3.45% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .Carnival Corporation  with Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

"We still have a month or so of historically volatile market conditions to make our way through. September hasn't at all been disappointing in that regard - it's been an exciting roller-coaster ride through most of the months. And so far, we've managed to come away mostly unscathed. Source: Still, investors should be starting to hone their lists of stocks to own during the seasonally strong October-through-December period.We recently ran our year-end model portfolios against the seasonally strong period to narrow the 7,000-plus companies tracked by our database. The goal: Find companies that have attractive seasonality results and rank high according to our Behavioral Valuation model.The following are 10 stocks to buy, and soon. Every investor should be considering at least a couple of names from our lengthy list as candidates for year-end outperformers.Marriott shares have struggled since topping out last year; however, that trend is changing. Revenues at  (NASDAQ:  ) have been on the rise as travelers are taking to the road more frequently. At the same time, margins are growing, resulting in earnings results that are outpacing the market.The consolidation that has taken place since March is now transitioning into an intermediate-term bullish trend as volume is on the rise - the signature of a trend that is gaining traction. The fact that sentiment toward Marriott has been pessimistic indicates that MAR shares are set to climb the ""Wall of Worry"" through the rest of the year.Marriott has high short interest and low buy recommendations - one of our favorite one-two punches. We think MAR stock can hit $80, good for a nearly 15% run before year's end.(NASDAQ: ) is a biopharma company whose clinical drug candidates are aimed at treating irritable bowel syndrome and type 2 diabetes, among other conditions. Biotechnology companies are coming back after almost a year of declines and pressure. Despite strong fundamentals, investors haven't had the appetite for risk in this sector, leaving plenty of opportunities as money is now flowing into the sector again. (NASDAQ:  ) is a biopharma company whose clinical drug candidates are aimed at treating irritable bowel syndrome and type 2 diabetes, among other conditions.It's also a strong candidate to beat the market for the rest of the year.LXRX shares are prepping a move above $20 for the first time 2009, which is attracting the attention of technical traders. At the same time, short sellers are on the wrong side of the move as 19 times the average daily volume is tied up in bearish bets. A break above $20 would be a sure-fire trigger for a powerful short covering rally.The payroll resources company has been expanding its business as the jobs market continues to grow. Those results have Paychex stock pushing to new all-time highs. The  is one of the strongest seasonal performers for the last quarter of the year, along with its component companies - and that includes  (NASDAQ:  ).The payroll resources company has been expanding its business as the jobs market continues to grow. Those results have Paychex stock pushing to new all-time highs.Like the other stocks on our list, PAYX is incredibly underappreciated by investors and Wall Street analysts. Currently, only 10% of the analysts tracking the stock have it ranked a buy, while the short interest outstanding on the shares accounts for 14 days' worth of average volume.Stocks making new highs with  much pessimism are bound to attract a lot of new attention. We like Paychex to outpace the market through year's end, with our models targeting a price of $68.(NASDAQ: ) is an Ohio-based bank that has been expanding in the area aggressively. Revenues and earnings have been strong for the past two years as a result, which also is making FFBC a decent candidate for mergers & acquisitions activity. Regional banks are getting a boost in the current interest-rate environment. Earlier this week, the  - good news for the regionals that make their money on balance sheets, not investments. (NASDAQ:  ) is an Ohio-based bank that has been expanding in the area aggressively. Revenues and earnings have been strong for the past two years as a result, which also is making FFBC a decent candidate for mergers & acquisitions activity.First Financial has posted a strong 22% return year-to-date against a regional bank sector that broadly is barely in positive territory. In addition to the performance, the stock trades with lower volatility than the sector, making it even more attractive. Yet only 22% of the analysts tracking the stock have it ranked a buy, leaving a lot of room for upgrades.FFBC just broke above the technically significant $21 level, which has volume on the rise. This signals growing interest in this underappreciated stock. Our model suggests that the migration of money to this stock will target a move to the $24-$25 price range, or about 14% upside.Year-over-year revenue for this financial grew by an average of more than 50% over the last two quarters, catapulting shares from $48 to $55. That strong growth should be enhanced by higher interest rates. Another commercial bank in the same situation as First Financial Bancorp is  (NASDAQ:  ).Year-over-year revenue for this financial grew by an average of more than 50% over the last two quarters, catapulting shares from $48 to $55. That strong growth should be enhanced by higher interest rates.The stock's sentiment picture is similar to the other financials on our list. The stock looks undervalued by the market and ready to move higher as it breaks through overhead resistance. That resistance sits at $57 and has held PNFP at bay for each of the three times it has been challenged since July 2015.A break above the $57 level will start a shift in sentiment, turning the sellers into buyers and drawing upgrades from Wall Street. This push will target a move to $65 - 18% higher from here.Apparently, Wall Street analysts and short sellers haven't gotten that memo. Insurance company  (NASDAQ:  ) has been on our list of ""companies to own"" for more than three years. The company continues to make improvements to its growing lines, which has resulted in better revenue and margins.Currently, only 20% of the analysts covering Cincinnati Financial stock have it ranked a buy. Come on! This is a company that has bested its peers in performance for more than two years. Similarly, short sellers continue to bet against the stock as the short interest ratio remains high at 7.6.Cincinnati Financial stock has been making new highs since 2014, meaning we're still seeing the stock climb that Wall of Worry. This wall should target an additional 15% move to $87.Recently, the stock plummeted from $60 to $40 after weaker revenue and earnings results; However, Agios is beginning to see some positive news regarding its product line. (NASDAQ:  ) is a pharmaceutical company that our model has picked up as an end-of-the-year rebound candidate.Recently, the stock plummeted from $60 to $40 after weaker revenue and earnings results; However, Agios is beginning to see some positive news regarding its product line.And from a technical perspective, the recent bounce from $40 has solidified a base for the stock to move from. Now, we're seeing the technical trends improving. This technical improvement will help to trigger a short squeeze rally on sustained prices above $50, which the stock just crossed.Our target price for Agios over the next two months remains at $60 - 14% higher from current prices - based on the improving technicals and resulting short squeeze rally that is in the process of being triggered.(NYSE: ) wasn't immune to this, as shares dipped to $32 a year ago - also amid a slowdown in revenues. Most healthcare companies were hit hard over the past year as political rhetoric caused a lot of uncertainty over pricing and regulations that could negatively affect bottom lines. (NYSE:  ) wasn't immune to this, as shares dipped to $32 a year ago - also amid a slowdown in revenues.However, a year later, revenue has moved back into positive growth territory, and share prices are headed in the right direction.Our current models have Baxter ranked a strong buy based on the stock's relative strength and a lack of optimistic sentiment from Wall Street. Last year's lows also saw downgrades to Baxter shares, and to date we've not see those analysts return as buyers. With only 20% buy recommendations from Wall Street, we expect to see BAX garner upgrades in the fourth quarter after another report featuring positive revenue and earnings growth.The expected upgrades should result in a year-end price around $55 per share, or 15% higher.Insulet shares struggled through 2015 and 2016 as earnings wavered. The company has been able to improve the trend over the last two quarters, however, resulting in a tradable trend that is preparing to propel the stock back to $50. Another stock from the healthcare equipment and suppliers group that has high marks from our rating models is  (NASDAQ:  ) - the lesser-known name behind the OmniPod Insulin Management System.A relatively high amount of short interest on PODD shares should be one of several catalysts for a move; more than 12 times the average daily volume for the shares is tied up in bearish bets. But Insulet is moving above $45, so it's likely these short sellers are about to start covering, sparking a rally.The combination of short covering and momentum behind the current technical strength has our models targeting 11% gains through year's end to $50 per share.Like many in the space, Cisco has spent years reinventing its products to adapt to the changing technology market - something that has paid off with improvement to the company's earnings results. Revenues are barely inching higher, but CSCO's expansion into the ""Internet of Things"" should increase the top line. An old-school technology favorite of ours is  (NASDAQ:  ).Like many in the space, Cisco has spent years reinventing its products to adapt to the changing technology market - something that has paid off with improvement to the company's earnings results. Revenues are barely inching higher, but CSCO's expansion into the ""Internet of Things"" should increase the top line.Technically, Cisco shares are preparing to move above their 2007 highs as they close in on $35. The technical picture has been gaining strength while CSCO continues to trade above its key trendlines - all of which are ascending. So there's some bullish news.Cisco shares have been the target of positive brokerage comments lately, meaning we are likely to see even more upgrades to build on the 57% buy recommendations currently held on the stock.This, along with the strong technicals, puts a year-end target price of $35 on Cisco Systems by year's end - a double-digit improvement.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now@2016-09-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-stocks-that-should-be-in-your-portfolio-right-now-2016-09-22

This trend could continue, with payroll processing clients served expected to increase by around 2% for the year to 613,000 clients.Comparatively, the number of HR services clients has increased at a much faster pace over the last couple of years, driven by the Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which includes a regulation wherein many employers are required to provide health insurance to employees. Additionally, the growth in small businesses has witnessed a consistent increase in 2016 thus far. According to the most recent data in the small business jobs index released by Paychex, the index stood at 100.70 for August, which was up by 0.22% over the previous year. The index has averaged 100.71 in 2016 thus far, which is an improvement after a weak end to 2015. This is a healthy sign for HR management firms such as ADP (  ) and Paychex as the total number of clients served by these companies is likely to continue to increase.The third key area of growth for Paychex in the coming quarters could be the interest earned on client assets. Over the last few years, interest rates have stayed extremely low, due to which the net client assets under management at Paychex grew from around $3.7 billion through FY 2013 to $4.1 billion in FY 2016. This figure can further improve to $4.2 billion in FY 2017 and continue to grow at around 3% in the coming years due to the hike in interest rates. Moreover, the yield on client funds could improve to around 1.8% in FY 2017, up from around 1.1% over the last few years, resulting in a significant revenue growth from this division.Given that the expenses in this segment are fixed in nature, the top line growth could directly translate to an improvement in the company-wide EBITDA margin. We forecast Paychex's EBITDA margin to improve by 60 basis points through FY 2017 as show below.Have more questions about Paychex (  )?

"Image source: Getty Images.Historically, the  hasn't been well-known as a habitat for  . The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success.Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio.Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18:
  
Data source: Yahoo! Finance.The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016.Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause.  , and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry.Another trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016.Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates.  in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets.At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices.For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

nvestors considering a purchase of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $61.08/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.6% return against the $50 commitment, or a 2.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to PAYX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Paychex Inc sees its shares fall 18.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $48.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.80 from $50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $50 strike for the 2.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Paychex Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.08) to be 19%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Commit To Buy Paychex At $50, Earn 3.6% Using Options@2016-08-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/commit-buy-paychex-50-earn-36-using-options-2016-08-26
The stock market is so dynamic that it's difficult to predict what a stock will do over a two-year stretch, much less a 25-year stretch. Yet every young long-term investor is looking for the best stocks to own for the next quarter century. Source: While none of us can look 25 years into the future, it can be helpful to look 25 years to the past at some of the best stocks of the last quarter century.Since August 1, 1991, the  's total return has been 463%. Each of the following top stocks generated total returns exponentially higher in that time.One of the common denominators among all these top stocks is dividends. You'll notice that these returns are total returns, which combines increases in share price with dividend payments. (  ) stock pays a generous 3.2% dividend, and the company has grown to become the largest self-storage company in the world. Since the company is structured as a REIT, 90% of its earnings have been returned to shareholders as dividend payments. Therefore, a large part of the company's 25-year gain has come from dividends.There's no question that the emergence of  (  ) has changed the future of retailers like  (  ) forever.However, TJX has been one of the best stocks over the past 25 years. Not even AMZN can slow the department store down. Through its Marshall's, TJ Maxx, Sierra Trading Post and HomeGoods brands, TJX stock has grown revenue 33.4% and net income 52.3% in the past five years.While other retailers are getting crushed by AMZN, TJX stock is up 190% in the past five years. The stock even pays a decent 1.3% dividend.The explosion of healthcare costs in recent decades has created a huge opportunity for health insurers like  (  ).It has also been very profitable for health insurance investors.Despite the huge run-up over the past 25 years, UNH stock is showing no signs of slowing down. Revenue is up 54.2% and net income is up 13% in the past five years. Incredibly, even though UNH has been one of the best stocks in the market for decades, it currently trades at a modest forward price-to-earnings ratio of only 15.7. UNH also pays a 1.8% dividend.As the total size of the U.S. population continues to grow, the number of Americans owning homes will grow as well. (  ) was founded way back in 1946. Seventy years later, it still delivers year-after year of earnings, revenue and dividend growth. That is the perfect recipe for becoming one of the best stocks of the past 25 years.Today, LOW stock pays a 1.8% dividend. Despite a huge 284% gain in the past five years, LOW still trades at a modest forward P/E ratio of 16.5.PAYX is the world's second-largest publicly traded payroll processing company, and the only one on this list that has been a total return 100-bagger in the past 25 years.The stock is among the best stocks of the past quarter century for the usual reasons: consistent earnings/revenue growth and reliable dividend payments. PAYX stock's dividend yield currently stands at 3.1%.As government regulations get more and more complicated, PAYX's services remain a necessity for businesses with large and complex payroll departments.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@The 5 Best Stocks of the Past 25 Years@2016-08-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-5-best-stocks-of-the-past-25-years-2016-08-19

"s expected, the start of the year's second earnings season has unleashed a new flock of dividend raises. As it's early days, we're sure to see at least a few more in the coming days and weeks.Image source: Getty imagesWhile we look forward to that, let's take a glance back at last week's lifters. They include:Master limited partnership  (NYSE: EPD) is mastering yet another quarterly distribution raise. It has declared a payout of $0.40 per unit, 5.3% higher than its predecessor.That's business as usual for the partnership, which has now bumped its distribution for 48 quarters in a row stretching back to mid-2004. data by That might be a bit unexpected for a business in the energy sector. However, Enterprise Products Partners is somewhat insulated from weakened  because it concentrates on the provision of infrastructure (pipelines, storage, etc).As a result, its finances haven't been slammed as much as peer companies more directly involved in the extraction and sale of black gold. The partnership's profitability and -- more importantly for distribution purposes -- distributable cash flow have actually held up quite well. It also remains nicely profitable on the bottom line, at $670 million for its Q1.I think it will continue to perform, given how well it's coping with the downturn. And continued profitability should support the dividend, which I believe will continue to rise incrementally. For income investors that have the nerve to contend with a challenging sector, this stock is certainly worthy of consideration.Enterprise Products Partners' new distribution will be paid on Aug. 5 to unit holders of record as of July 29. It would yield 5.4% at the current unit price, well above the 2% average yield of dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500.An interesting sideways play on the US transportation sector, railcar and barge maker  (NYSE: GBX) is hiking its quarterly dividend despite notable drops in key fundamentals. The company will pay $0.21 per share, a 5% improvement over the current level.The dividend is going in the opposite direction as the company's results. This is due to softness in the global economy, plus those aforementioned lower oil prices (which soften demand from energy companies shipping their wares), not to mention reduced prices for many commodities.In Greenbrier's most recently reported quarter, it booked a net profit of over $35 million, 17% below the same period last year. Revenue also saw a decline, by 14% to $613 million. Both figures, however, beat the average analyst estimates. Additionally, the company's backlog remains strong, while certain foreign markets seem to be picking up.Meanwhile, recently Greenbrier has done a good job growing operating and free cash flow in spite of what it terms the ""headwinds"" buffeting its business. Sooner or later, its markets will recover, therefore I don't think the freshly raised dividend will come under threat. To me, Greenbrier looks like a fairly good buy on the down side of a cycle just now. data by Greenbrier's upcoming payout is to be dispensed on Aug. 10 to stockholders of record as of July 20. It would yield 2.6% on the most recent closing share price.Payments processing specialist  (NASDAQ: PAYX) is about to cut bigger checks for its investors. It has lifted its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.46 per share. Additionally, it has launched a new $350 million share repurchase program.The company is a habitual dividend payer stretching back for several decades. In recent years it's tended to hike the payout annually around this time of the year.The announcement of the latest one comes on the heels of Paychex's Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, both of which showed encouraging growth where it counts. Revenue grew by a respective 9% and 8% (to $754 million and $2.95 billion), while net income advanced by 11% and 12% (to $178 million and $757 million). data by Paychex's balance sheet is clean, with over $6.4 billion in assets and no debt. Meanwhile, operating cash flow in fiscal 2016 crossed the $1 billion mark, providing more than enough for both the dividend and that year's set of stock buybacks. Paychex is in good financial shape, and investors shouldn't worry about the viability of its payout.The company's raised dividend will be handed out on Aug. 25 to shareholders of record as of Aug. 1.

 is a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses in the United States. Paychex's payroll service continues to perform well and the company continues to see better-than-expected demand for its human resource outsourcing services.The company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are encouraging. We consider that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.However, increased investment in new and innovative products, sluggish macroeconomic conditions and severe competition from other players in the space has made this sector a very tough one to be in for the short term. Due to this, investors are eagerly awaiting PAYX's earnings report in order to set the record straight and to give some guidance on where this company is heading.PAYX have a decent history when it comes to recent earnings reports as the stock has beaten estimates twice and also meets twice in the last four quarters, making for an average surprise of approximately 0.98%.Currently, PAYX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but that could definitely change following the company's earnings report which was just released.

 reported strong results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 wherein the bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line beat. Nevertheless, the company marked a year over year improvement on both counts.Earnings of 49 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew 11.4% year over year mainly on the back of higher revenues.Paychex reported total revenue (including Interest on funds held for clients) of $753.9 million, up 9% year over year. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $751 million. Excluding interest on funds held for its clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) grew 9% year over year to $741.6 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 5% from the year-ago period to $430.4 million, primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base. The acquisition of Advanced Partners contributed approximately 1% to the segment's revenue growth.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 14% year over year to $311.2 million mainly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% on a year over year basis to $12.3 million primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses increased 8% from the year-ago figure to $477.6 million due to 6% rise in compensation-related expenditure. However, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 30 basis points (bps) to 62.3%.Consequently, Paychex's operating margin expanded 30 bps to 36.6%. In dollar terms, reported operating income increased 10% year over year to $276.3 million.Net income came in at $178.1 million or 49 cents, up from $161.2 million or 44 cents reported last year.Paychex exited fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $352.1 million compared with $327.2 million at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. The company generated operating cash flow of $1.018 billion in fiscal 2016.During the fiscal, Paychex repurchased approximately $107.9 million common stocks and paid $606.5 million as dividend.Paychex issued the fiscal 2017 outlook. Management expects 4% year over year increase in Payroll Service revenues. Human Resource Services revenues are likely to grow in the range of 12-14%.Total service revenue is likely to increase 7-8%. Interest on funds held for its clients and investment income are projected to grow in the mid-single-digit range.Operating income as a percentage of revenues is likely to be 38%. Effective income tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 35.5% to 36%. Net income is likely to increase 8% year over year.Paychex reported strong fourth-quarter results with earnings coming in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassing the same. Moreover, the company issued an optimistic fiscal 2017 guidance, signifying that it is relatively well placed despite the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Furthermore, we are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, support the long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to be the other growth drivers. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity  remain the primary concerns.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"DP (  ) has reported 7-8% revenue growth over the last few years, fueled by higher demand for HR outsourcing and services in that period. HR outsourcing revenues have increased by over 15% in each of the last three years. Comparatively, payroll processing revenues have witnessed moderate single-digit growth in the last four years. In line with the trend over the previous years, we forecast ADP's net revenues to grow by 8% in 2016, with growth primarily coming from HR outsourcing and services. Additionally, ADP's cash operating expenses are likely to increase at the same rate as revenues, leading to a roughly flat operating margin over the previous year. According to our estimates, ADP's adjusted EBITDA margin stood at just under 21% in 2015 and is likely to remain at around that level through 2016.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jun 30. Last quarter, the payroll and human resource solutions provider's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In the past four quarters, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched the same on two occasions. This represents an average positive earnings surprise of 0.98%. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on boosting sales force to drive revenues. We also believe that the company's expansion initiatives, including joint ventures and acquisitions, are in sync with its long-term growth strategy.One of the key secular growth drivers for Paychex is the demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost-cutting potential. Moreover, growing regulatory burden on small companies underscores increasing need for outsourcing non-core activities.The company continues to capitalize on this opportunity by regularly introducing new products and services for upselling and moving into the mid-market, which should aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, sluggish economic growth and a possible rise in interest rates remain concerns. Moreover, intensifying competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing Inc.  and Insperity could add to its woes.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 49 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Although Paychex's Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Synergy Resources Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Worthington Industries, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +9.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Among the largest underlying components of USMV, in trading today General Mills, Inc.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of USMV, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, USMV's low point in its 52 week range is $26.41 per share, with $45.30 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $45.02. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Inflow Detected - USMV, GIS, PEP, PAYX@2016-06-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-inflow-detected-usmv-gis-pep-payx-2016-06-22
" recently agreed to acquire DST Systems Inc.'s  North American Customer Communications (NACC) business for a cash consideration of $410 million. The transaction is anticipated to close next month.DST Systems' NACC is the largest transactional printer in North America. The unit offers customer communication services including print and digital communication solutions, content management, postal optimization, and fulfillment.Notably, NACC generated $1.1 billion of revenues in fiscal 2015, which accounted for approximately 39% of DST Systems' total revenue. The unit employs over 2,300 personnel and has four production facilities in El Dorado Hills, CA; South Windsor, CT; Kansas City, MO; and Markham in Ontario, Canada.Broadridge intends to integrate NACC with its Investor Communication Solutions business upon successful completion of the acquisition. The transaction will allow it to boost its digital communications offerings and expand the scale of its print communications business.Broadridge's President and CEO, Richard Daly stated, ""The addition of NACC, an industry leader, is a natural extension of our communications business and will provide immediate benefits for our clients through enhanced production capabilities and expedited delivery times"".He added, ""It also positions us to be a communications leader across a number of market verticals and a provider of a unique suite of multi-channel communications solutions, empowering Broadridge to accelerate the industry's conversion to digital communications and meet the diverse preferences of our clients' customers.""The company believes that the deal will be immediately accretive to the bottom line. The company expects the NACC acquisition to be 1-3 cents accretive to GAAP earnings and 11-14 cents to non-GAAP adjusted earnings during the first year post completion. During the second year, the transaction will provide 9-13 cents accretion to earnings on a GAAP basis and 16-21 cents on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.Apart from this, Broadridge expects to achieve cost synergies of approximately $20 million within 18-30 months of completion of the transaction.Broadridge is a leading global provider of technology-based outsourcing solutions to the financial services industry. The company offers a broad, integrated suite of innovative global solutions across the investment lifecycle in addition to a wide range of cost-effective and scalable solutions to the financial industry. The company's systems lower clients' capital investments in operations infrastructure, thereby allowing them to focus on core business activities.Strength of the company's products and services, led by the Investor Communications business, allows it to navigate through the ongoing economic challenges. We believe that these positives, combined with new product initiatives, will enable the company to counter macro headwinds to a large extent. They will also provide Broadridge an opportunity to grow further as and when the financial services market improves.Furthermore, we are optimistic about Broadridge's strategic acquisitions, product launches, share repurchase programs and regular dividend payment policies. We also believe that the company's close association with Accenture plc  will be beneficial over the long term.However, competition and pricing pressure remain major concerns.Currently, Broadridge carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the Outsourcing industry is Paychex Inc.  carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"aychex's (  ) revenues have grown by 8-9% over the last few years, with much of the growth coming from its HR outsourcing and services business. HR outsourcing revenues have grown at over 15% over the last few years, with the company cementing its position as the market leader for HR outsourcing for small and medium sized businesses. Comparatively, its core payroll processing business has grown at a steady 3-4%, owing to consistent 2-4% price increases over the last few years to complement the growth in its customer base. We forecast Paychex's net revenues to increase by 8% this year, with the most growth coming from HR outsourcing and services. Additionally, Paychex managed to limit the increase in expenses leading to healthier margins. Given that Paychex's expenses in the Payroll division and interest income are largely fixed in nature, we expect the revenue growth to translate to an improvement in margins. Consequently, Paychex's adjusted EBITDA margin for 2016 could increase from 43.5% in 2015 to 45.5% in 2016.Have more questions about Paychex (  )?

n 1956, John Kelly of  AAAs (  ) Bell Labs published AAA  ] .AAA This publication discusses the criteria and formula that assisted AT&T with its long distance telephone signal noise. After its publication, individuals who engaged in betting realized the potential of his work. Talk about intellectual cross-pollination! The Kelly Formula allowed gamblers to optimize the sizes of their bets in the long term. Since then the formula has found a strong group of proponents in the investment world.The Kelly Criteria are actually relatively simple in their design. There are two components that make up the basis of the formula. The first is the probability that your transaction will produce a profitable return. This is called the win probability. The second is the total dollar amount of transactions with positive returns divided by total amount of transactions with negative returns. This is called the win/loss ratio.The actual Kelly Formula utilizes both of these criteria in its calculations. The formula gives the investor the Kelly Percentage AAA or what percentage the transaction should take up in your portfolio. LetAAAs start with formula itself.W represents the win probability and R represents the win/loss ratio. To get the numbers required to populate the equation, the following steps are required.ItAAAs far beyond the purview of this article to comprehensively address the pros and cons of the formula. However, at the Nintai Charitable Trust we employ the Kelly Formula as a piece in an integrated capital deployment strategy. Simply put, it plays a very diminished role in our capital allocation decisions. Over the course of our investment management career weAAAve had many individuals ask why we donAAAt use the formula to a greater degree in our portfolio selection.The short answer is I believe the formula gives an investor a partial AAA and wholly incomplete AAA picture of the capital allocation process. The idea of your largest position being dictated by a formulaic approach is compelling. In games of chance it is even more so. Allowing your allocation of capital to be decided by such an approach alone gives away the great advantage one has as an investment manager.Anybody who plays whist and bridge knows there is a vast difference in the role of luck between them. In bridge, partners communicate with each other through a detailed bidding process that discusses both strength of their hands and their preferred suit.

"The market's rally is catching many investors off guard, as stocks are surging through what is normally a seasonally weak patch of the year. But, among the countless stocks to buy, there's a special group of stocks participating in the rally that are taking the smarter minds on Wall Street by surprise.The group I'm talking about is what I refer to as the ""under-loved performers"". Stocks that are turning in strong performances that are among the least recommended by Wall Street analysts fall into this category. This situation will likely provide nimble investors with an opportunity to ride Wall Street's coat tails.The group I'm talking about is what I refer to as the ""under-loved performers"". Stocks that are turning in strong performances that are among the least recommended by Wall Street analysts fall into this category.The idea behind taking a position in these stocks is simple: At some point, the bearish analysts will become more bullish and begin upgrading these stocks as they continue to outperform the market. Those upgrades then add more fuel to the rally fire. Of course, by being there before the upgrades we get the benefit of their buying.Our database models filter through the  on a daily basis to identify the under-loved performers that are ripe for the next upgrade rally. The following are three of the best under-loved, high-performing stocks to buy. 6.8The analysts really don't like  (  ). In fact, only 5% of the Wall Street crowd has CAT stock ranked as a buy.To some degree you have to agree that there should be some bearishness towards the stock after turning in a 12-month return of -9.5%, while the S&P 500 is up just under 2% for the same period.The analysts should be the trendsetters though, not the followers, which is why we think there's an opportunity here. Caterpillar shares are starting to show signs of a longer-term turnaround as the fundamental data (earnings and margins) have helped the stock build a base at the $60 mark. This is also the site of some technical support as well.The charts are showing a friendly trend for CAT stock, with the stock's 50-day moving average shifting into bullish mode as the stock gets ready to break above the $80 price.An added bonus is the short interest ratio, which is elevated to 6.8. This indicates that the potential for a short covering rally exists when the stock breaks $80. Right now, Caterpillar remains on our buy list with a price target in the mid-90s. 10.4Our models have been bullish on  (  ) for some time now, as everything from a growing jobs market to increased regulations help this payroll processor (plus more) to build even stronger fundamentals.Along with a positive fundamental backdrop, the company has been a relative strength leader against the S&P 500 over the last year racking-up 14.6% gains against the S&P for the same period. Looking at a shorter-term period, Paychex stock has only slightly outperformed the market on a year-to-date basis, but has done so with 25% less volatility that the S&P 500 while paying a 3% dividend.Sentiment is decidedly negative: The short interest ratio for PAYX stock is 10.4 and building, as it did in the third quarter of 2015 just before a rally that took the shares from $47 to $54.Also decidedly lopsided on the sentiment front is the current 10% buy rankings from the analysts covering the stock. Remember, only 10% of the Wall Street analysts are recommending this stock a buy as it continues to punch through to new all-time highs for the last few years.The analysts will start to feel the pain of not having PAYX on their ""Buy Lists"", which will likely result in some upgrade opportunities for the shares to help those of us wise enough to see an opportunity watch the stock go higher. 7.4Healthcare-related stocks have been taking some heat as the regulatory and insurance environment appear to be approaching some tectonic shifts. We like the idea of  (  ) as a holding, since they perform lab work that everyone will still have to have done and they're doing it with good margins.Quest Diagnostics shares are another example of a stock that is getting ready to break through to new highs as the analyst community is missing the boat. Currently, only 14% of the analysts covering the shares have it ranked a buy.The chart for DGX is incredibly attractive, as it shows a pending breakout to new all-time monthly highs as the shares approach $80. This is where we think a few things will happen.First, a sustained move above $80 is likely to generate some upgrades, which will get the crowd buying shares of Quest Diagnostics. Second, the break above $80 will also likely trigger a short covering rally, as the current short interest ratio of 7.4 remains slightly elevated.From a break above $80, our models target another 10% to 15% move in DGX shares before year-end.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Under-Loved Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up@2016-06-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-under-loved-stocks-to-buy-before-wall-street-wakes-up-2016-06-08
"The cat-and-mouse game between Wall Street and the Federal Reserve continued this week, with the Fed minutes from the central bank's April policy meeting showing that a lending rate hike in June may very well be on the table.The Fed went into 2016 planning to lift rates four times during the course of the year, with an intermediate-term target fed funds rate of 2%. That went out the window when Q4 GDP underperformed, and recent Q1 data showed economic expansion of just 0.5%. Nonetheless, the U.S. labor market tells a vastly different story, with the unemployment rate holding firm at 5% as of April, down 50% from the unemployment rate peak of the Great Recession in Oct. 2009.Monetary tightening from the Fed often brings mixed emotions to Wall Street. On one hand, tightening only comes about because the Fed is trying to keep the U.S. economy from overheating. This would imply that the jobs market and overall economy are in pretty good shape, suggesting corporate America is doing just fine. On the other hand, monetary tightening makes it more expensive to borrow, which can crush M&A activity and stymie loans, harming corporate expansion efforts and stifling future growth prospects.So what's an investor to do? With the Fed expected to embark on a new round of monetary tightening, my suggestion is to consider buying three types of stocks.If there's a group of stocks that tends to benefit the most from increasing interest rates, it's the financial sector.Image source: Bank of America. (NYSE: BAC) , for example, announced last year that a 100-basis point increase in short- and long-term rates would equate to an additional $4.6 billion in annual net interest income, or up to a $0.43 per share boost in annual EPS. Money center banks like Bank of America are likely to see their net interest margins expand if lending rates rise, which allows banks to charge more for loans, as well as boost variable rates for existing loans. Considering that Bank of America has one of the lowest returns on assets among its peers, it could be among the biggest beneficiaries of a rate increase, with its share price still depressed on a tangible book value basis.But don't forget about financial stocks that pool their money, such as insurers and payroll processing companies. Insurer  (NYSE: ALL) ended its latest quarter with $106 billion in total assets, of which $57.3 billion was invested in fixed income securities. Because this money needs to be available for claims, insurers like Allstate typically buy extremely safe investments like bonds. As rates rise, investment income on this $57 billion can climb too, potentially adding more than $1 billion in extra investment income to Allstate's bottom line, annually, in the coming years.Payroll processors like  (NASDAQ: PAYX) operate similarly. Wages received from clients are often held for a short period of time before being distributed to employees, with payroll processors like Paychex earning interest on the short-term float and padding their pockets. The higher interest rates climb, the more a company like Paychex can make on its float. As of the end of its fiscal third quarter, Paychex held average investment balances of $4.52 billion for clients and $827 million in corporate investments, with an average earned rate of just 1%.Select technology companies that are carrying around healthy net cash balances should also fare pretty darn well in a rising rate environment, for two key reasons.Image source: Microsoft.The first, as you may have surmised, is that having a large cash pile means the opportunity to earn more in interest via short- and long-term investments. This isn't to say tech companies are going to be running out to buy U.S. Treasury bonds if rates lift a quarter point come June, but it's going to give companies like  (NASDAQ: MSFT) , which has generated in excess of $31 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12-month period, the opportunity to park its cash somewhere that can earn it reasonable income. Yes, Microsoft is carrying almost $47 billion in debt, but it still maintains a net cash balance of nearly $59 billion. A lot of big tech companies are like Microsoft, in that they aren't reliant on debt to finance their growth, which could mean far less of an adverse impact when rate hikes occur. Plus, the added investment income could be returned to investors in the form of a dividend hike.The other factor working in cash-rich tech stocks' favor is that the U.S. economy is relatively healthy. Although Q1 GDP may not show it, rates expand only when the Fed believes the economy is marching forward -- and if the economy is improving, that could mean more money being spent on software and gadgets.Finally, a surprising category of stocks that can actually perform pretty well when rates are rising are consumer discretionary stocks, or companies that sell non-essential items. We're talking about apparel, service, and media companies, to name a few examples.Image source: Starbucks.Why consumer discretionary companies? Although they tend to have more debt than the large tech stocks discussed above, consumer discretionary companies are more adept at taking advantage of a robust economy. Again, notwithstanding the anemic Q1 GDP growth of 0.5%, the Fed wouldn't be raising lending rates if it didn't see a number of U.S. economic parameters improving. If rates are rising, it would presumably mean that the consumer is out there spending their money somewhere; and what better way to take advantage of that than with consumer discretionary stocks.An example I like to fall back on here is  (NASDAQ: SBUX) . Consumers already have a strong bond to Starbucks (this is coming from a 20-year Starbucks addict), and Starbucks' loyalty rewards program, which rewards consumers with free beverages based on their spending habits, is another reason why consumers stick with the brand. If the economy is improving, consumers aren't likely to give up that afternoon frappuccino, choosing instead to make their daily drink a small luxury or indulgence. And Starbucks knows this, which is why it received a 5% same-store boost in the Americas in its fiscal second quarter because of price increases. A solid discretionary company like Starbucks should do just fine in a rising rate environment.What companies are on your radar when rates rise? Share them in the comments below.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (Symbol: USMV) where we have detected an approximate $138.9 million dollar inflow -- that's a 1.0% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 297,000,000 to 300,100,000). Among the largest underlying components of USMV, in trading today General Mills, Inc.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of USMV, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, USMV's low point in its 52 week range is $26.41 per share, with $44.93 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $44.89. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Inflows: USMV, GIS, PAYX, PEP@2016-06-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-inflows-usmv-gis-payx-pep-2016-06-06

"hares of  hit a new 52-week high of $54.95 on Jun 2, 2016, eventually closing at $54.94. The stock has delivered a strong one-year return of 14% and a year-to-date return of 3.9%. The average trading volume for the last three months aggregated approximately 1,784K.Paychex delivered a positive earnings surprise in two out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 0.98%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has a market cap of $19.61 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.2%.Paychex is poised to benefit as small and medium businesses (SMBs) have increased outsourcing their HR functions. Further, the SMB segment has shown improvement in the recruitment process as well. We believe that Paychex's better scale, capital base, regulatory and oversight expertise and institutional knowledge provide it with a competitive advantage.We are also positive as Paychex continues to invest in SaaS technology and mobile applications by acquiring SaaS-based businesses. Further, the enhancement of mobile technology by adding health and benefits information to its mobile applications will benefit Paychex.We are optimistic that Paychex might witness growth by successfully cross-selling newer products such as Paychex Premier, Major Market Services (MMS) and ancillary HRS products such as 401(k) record keeping, health insurance sales and workers' compensation administration to the existing client base.Also, higher adoption of Paychex's Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind for the company.Going further, we are positive about the SurePayroll acquisition. We believe that the acquisition will help Paychex enhance the overall company's service offering and increase its market share. SurePayroll's user-friendly online payroll solutions are specifically targeted at small businesses. Small businesses are a significant source of revenues for Paychex. The acquisition is expected to boost the company's top line, going forward.Recently, Paychex reported strong results for third-quarter fiscal 2016 wherein the bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line beat the same. Nevertheless, the company marked year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Furthermore, we are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, support the long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to be the other growth drivers.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity, Inc.  remain concerns.Another stock worth considering in the broder technology sector is DST Systems Inc.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Reports of the death of short sellers have been greatly exaggerated.Click to Enlarge All respect and apologies to Mr. Twain for the use of his quote, but the market has been assuming that short sellers have been the main catalyst behind the latest rally in stocks as they've been squeezed out of the market. According to the latest data, the short sellers are very much alive and well.We tend to look at the short interest for ETFs like the  (  ) and the  (  ) as proxies for short selling activity.Historically, this has been an effective measure, but not now.Short interest on the SPY shares have been on the decline and are heading towards multiyear lows. On the surface, this suggest that short sellers have been squeezed from the market. Looking deeper into the data tells another story.Total short interest for the  constituent companies has actually been on the rise for the last six to nine months, while short interest on the SPY shares have been on the decline. The disparity between these trends identifies the fact that there are still a large number of short squeeze opportunities for us to profit from.The table above displays 20 companies within the S&P 500 that are currently on the potential short squeeze list. These stocks have seen increases in already relatively high short interest while exhibiting technical strength. This and other measures that our model monitors identify these stocks as likely to see a short covering rally soon.The following are three short squeeze stocks to look out for. 10.4 (  ) is best known for its various consumer-branded containers. Improving consumer sentiment and spending continues to fuel sales of its products, resulting in an impressive relative strength move against the market.Over the last three months, Newell Rubbermaid shares have rallied 20% against the S&P 500's 11% move, putting NWL among the best performers. Despite the performance, short sellers have bet against Newell Rubbermaid shares heavily, taking the stocks' short interest to its highest level in more than two years.With a short interest ratio of 10.4, after another 4% increase in short interest, Newell Rubbermaid stock is setup for a short covering rally. The trigger price for a covering rally is likely to be the $46 mark, just a short shot from current prices. Our models suggest the covering rally will lift shares back above the $50 level. 8.3Monthly payroll data continues to show growth in the jobs market, which means that  (  ) and its competitors are busy. PAYX provided another quarter of positive earnings and revenue results on March 30, reaffirming their current fiscal year outlook for revenue.Paychex stock has been trading in tandem with the S&P 500 lately, though the longer-term look back shows strong relative strength against the market. More recently, the shares have run into some resistance at $54, but we've seen a consolidation that may help PAYX break through this resistance on the next rally.Such a rally will be problematic for short sellers as the short interest ratio stands at 8.3. A break above the $54 level will start squeezing the shorts, forcing the stock into a covering rally. In addition, only 10% of the analysts covering the stock have it ranked a buy, despite the fact that the stock has been moving back towards its all-time highs at $60.A single upgrade or a move back above $54 is likely to trigger the next short covering rally, which will likely target the $60 level over the next four to six months. 6.8Sentiment towards anything associated with Oilfield Services is down as investors continue to avoid the industry. Despite this, there are some trading opportunities within the group.Short sellers are drawing a line on the largest of the Oil Services companies as  (  ) stock saw another increase in short interest in the last report, maintaining a short interest ratio near 7 for the third month in a row.Recently, Schlumberger stock has rallied 18%, doubling the S&P 500 performance since late January. This indicates that the short sellers are feeling some pressure and are likely close to getting squeezed out.This weekend's OPEN meeting may result in little production change, which may see its shares pull back slightly, but with technical support in place at the $75 level, it appears that it will only be a matter of time before SLB stock gets the benefit of a covering rally.Our model targets a move to $82 as a result of a short covering rally, but the long-term prospects for SLB stock appear brighter than their peers.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Short Squeeze Stocks Ready to Burst in April@2016-04-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-short-squeeze-stocks-ready-to-burst-in-april-2016-04-18

Nevertheless, the company marked year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Earnings of 50 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew 9% year over year mainly on the back of higher revenues.Paychex reported total revenue (including Interest on funds held for clients) of $752.6 million, up 7% year over year. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $751 million. Excluding interest on funds held for clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) grew 7% year over year to $740.7 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 4% from the year-ago period to $439.6 million, primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 12% year over year to $301.1 million mainly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% on a year-over-year basis to $11.9 million primarily benefiting from higher average interest rates earned.Paychex's total expenses increased 7% from the year-ago figure to $472.6 million due to 5% rise in compensation-related expenditure. Moreover, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, rose 30 basis points (bps) to 62.8%.Consequently, Paychex's operating margin contracted 30 bps to 37.2%. However, in dollar terms, reported operating income increased 6% year over year to $280 million.Net income came in at $180.4 million or 50 cents, up from $169.4 million or 46 cents reported last year.Paychex exited fiscal third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $327.2 million compared with $476.4 million at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. The company generated operating cash flow of $791.2 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016.During the first nine months of fiscal 2016, Paychex repurchased approximately $107.9 million common stocks and paid $455 million as dividend.Paychex reiterated the fiscal 2016 outlook. Management continues to expect 4-5% year-over-year increase in Payroll Service revenues. Human Resource Services revenues are likely to grow in the range of 10-13%.Total service revenue is likely to increase 7-8%. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income are projected to remain flat. Net income is likely to be within 8-9%.Paychex reported strong third-quarter results with earnings coming in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassing the same. Moreover, the company reiterated the optimistic fiscal 2016 guidance, signifying that it is relatively well placed despite the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Furthermore, we are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, support the long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to be the other growth drivers. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity  remain the concerns.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock worth considering in the outsourcing industry is Convergys Corporation  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses in the United States. Paychex's payroll service continues to perform well and the company continues to see better-than-expected demand for its human resource outsourcing services.The company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth are encouraging. We consider that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.However, increased investment in new and innovative products, sluggish macroeconomic conditions and severe competition from other players in the space has made this sector a very tough one to be in for the short term.PAYX have a decent history when it comes to recent earnings reports as the stock has beaten estimates twice and also meets twice in the last four quarters, making for an average surprise of approximately 0.98%.Currently, PAYX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company's earnings report which was just released.

The company's reported earnings of 50 cents per share in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues surpassed. Paychex posted revenues of $752.6 million, compared to our consensus estimate of $751 million.

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF (Symbol: USMV) where we have detected an approximate $304.7 million dollar inflow -- that's a 2.7% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 254,200,000 to 261,100,000). Among the largest underlying components of USMV, in trading today Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is down about 1%, Newmont Mining Corp (Symbol: NEM) is up about 1.6%, and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (Symbol: AVB) is lower by about 0.3%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of USMV, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, USMV's low point in its 52 week range is $26.41 per share, with $44.34 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $43.94. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@USMV, PAYX, NEM, AVB: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2016-04-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/usmv-payx-nem-avb-large-inflows-detected-etf-2016-04-07

"Following through on Tuesday's Janet Yellen-inspired rally, and partially fueled by more ""Goldilocks"" job news (not too hot, not too cold), the bulls dug in again on Wednesday, pushing the  up 0.44% to a close of 2063.95. Not every stock was able to get in on that rally, however. Owners of  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) were all left standing on the outside looking in.Here's the deal.The near 2% plunge Boeing shares dished out today isn't earth shattering. But, it is a stark relative to the respectable gain the overall market made … particularly against the backdrop of alarming news BA delivered on Wednesday.In short, aircraft maker Boeing says it will eliminate anywhere between  and  within the next few months as part of an ongoing stream of drastic cost-cutting measures.Boeing has indeed been cutting expenses where it can for the past several months, so the news isn't entirely out of character. Yet, the decision doesn't quite jive with the bullishness that has largely surrounded BA for the past few weeks, including the boost that bullishness has gotten from  .However, BA shareholders are seeing a little more in the announced job cuts than just a way of reducing expenses. It's being interpreted as an omen that the company isn't stoked about its foreseeable future.Paychex became yet-another cliched victim of the ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" phenomenon, meeting its third-quarter expectations then watching PAYX slump more than 2% anyway.Last quarter, Paychex  .

Paychex didn't do that this time around.Last but not least, just when it looked like things couldn't get any worse for Valeant Pharmaceuticals - like VRX shares have finally found something akin to a bottom - the company finds another way to pour gasoline on the dying fire.Today's way: Already passed the expected filing date for its Q4 and full-year report, Valeant Pharmaceuticals announced today it was  that, if not met, would trigger the technical default on its loans.The permission wouldn't be granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rather, the company's lenders themselves are being asked to waive their legal claims should Valeant not file their accounting statements in time. Nevertheless, a failure to make a timely filing could still crimp the value of VRX shares as the  associated with quarterly report requirements.Whatever the case, the preemptive legal wrangling just looks bad, and it sent VRX lower by more than 6% on Wednesday.The post ), Paychex, Inc.

"Overbought pressures are taking their toll on stock indices. Many are dithering near resistance amid profit-taking from traders looking to harvest gains following the past month's gargantuan gains.The New York based payroll services provider's chart is eye
candy for technicians. Fortunately for stock bulls, the giveback has been mild, providing attractive breakout setups across the board, and one such beauty is  (  ).The New York based payroll services provider's chart is eye candy for technicians.Since breaching 10-year resistance at $46 back in 2014, PAYX stock has continued trending higher in bullish fashion. Volatility has accompanied Paychex through much of 2016.After diving some 12% in January, shares have galloped higher reclaiming all that was lost.With order now restored, PAYX sits above all major moving averages and has returned to a pivotal resistance level at $54.50. This zone halted numerous rallies last November and December. But with the strength supporting its current run a breakout seems inevitable.The search for a proper target in Paychex requires taking the long view of its chart. At the height of the dot-com bubble PAYX stock, which calls the Nasdaq home, notched an all-time high of $61.25. A re-test, and hopefully breach, of the prior peak is just a matter of time. At its current perch, PAYX sits a mere 13% away.Source: OptionsAnalytixThe cup-and-handle pattern that defines the past three months of trading in the stock suggests an eventual rise to the low $60s is altogether doable.One monkey wrench worth mentioning is the earnings announcement slated for Wednesday morning. Obviously, disappointing earnings could upset the beautiful breakout setup.Barring that, the future looks bright for PAYX.With earnings looming, option premiums are running on the high side, making a straight call purchase expensive. To reduce the cost, not to mention the risk, consider entering a bull call spread instead.Buy the June $55/$57.50 call spread for 88 cents or better. The risk is limited to the initial debit and will be lost if PAYX stock price is below $55 at June expiration.The reward is limited to the distance between strikes minus the net debit, or $1.62, and will be captured if Paychex can rise above $57.50 by expiration.By risking 88 cents to capture $1.62, the trade offers an eye-popping 184% return.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Paychex, Inc.: PAYX Stock Will Reach All-Time Highs@2016-03-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-inc-payx-stock-will-reach-all-time-highs-2016-03-29

"n the winter of 1928, Joe Kennedy decided to stop to have his shoes shined before he started his day's work at the office. When the boy finished, he offered Kennedy a stock tip: ""Buy Hindenburg."" Kennedy soon sold off his stocks, thinking, ""You know it's time to sell when the shoeshine boys start giving you stock tips. This bull market is over.""Over the years we've all seen events that indicate the high in the stock markets - blockbuster deals by private equity that have absolutely no chance of ever making a return (at least positive) for their investors [1] , commercials that imply a tow truck driver owns an island/country [2] or the wave of ""bubble funds"" that seem to crop up every time during a market peak [3] .I bring these up because I recently saw a commercial [4] that certainly meets the criterion of hinting at a market high. In this case the hands down winner is the recent Super Bowl commercial for a company called SoFi. Its commercial model believes the yawning gap between have and have-nots is filled with those who are ""great"" and those who are ""not great."" Frankly you are far more likely to be with the ""not great"" than the ""great,"" according to their marketing.So what does SoFi do? At its most basic it has taken the unicorn model (pumping an organization full of venture capital and private equity and delaying a public offering) writ large - providing loans for people who don't need money (the great) and not providing loans for those who have a need (the not great).One of my favorite writers Felix Salmon has a great discussion about the commercial here . He cogently lays out the absurdity of the company's message, its ridiculous valuation and the improbability of spending a large percentage of its revenue on insulting marketing campaigns.My take on SoFi is from a different angle. Much like Ambassador Kennedy's feelings on getting a stock tip from the shoeshine boy, SoFi's commercial is a warning signal for a potential market top. Combined with other news such as this and this , I recommend keeping your eye out for three clear markers of a market peak.Read More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

nvestors considering a purchase of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $46.23/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $30 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.10. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.7% return against the $30 commitment, or a 1.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to PAYX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $30 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Paychex Inc sees its shares decline 35% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $28.90 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.10 from $30), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $30 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $30 strike for the 1.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Paychex Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $46.23) to be 19%.

 is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Mar 30. Last quarter, the payroll and human resource solutions provider posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.96%. It is worth noting that the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.98%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on growing its sales force to boost revenues. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, are in tune with its long-term growth strategy.Further, one of the key secular growth drivers of Paychex is the demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost-cutting potential. Moreover, the growing regulatory burden on small companies signifies that the need to outsource non-core activities is increasing.The company continues to capitalize on this opportunity by introducing products and services regularly for upselling to the client base and moving into the mid-market which should aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, sluggish economic growth and a possible rise in interest rates remain the concerns. Moreover, intensifying competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing Inc.  and Insperity may add to the woes.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 50 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex's Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of stocks, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:SunEdison Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +30.12% and a Zacks Rank #2.Jarden Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" recently completed the acquisition of Advanced Partners within a month of entering into the deal. However, the financial terms of the merger, signed on Dec 2, have not been disclosed.According to Paychex, Advance Partners ""offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services, which include payroll, invoicing, and tax preparation."" Founded in 1998, Advance's end customers total about 7,500 businesses that are clients of the staffing firms that Advance serves.Therefore, the acquisition will enable Paychex to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the temporary staffing industry.Citing an industry data report, Paychex stated, ""There are more than three million temporary staffing employees in the United States, and approximately 10,000 small and mid-sized staffing businesses that support this employee population."" Therefore, the acquisition will open new avenues of growth for the company, in our view.Martin Mucci, Paychex president and CEO said, ""The staffing outsourcing business is a growing industry that serves many small and mid-sized firms, which is a perfect fit for Paychex. We are excited about Advance Partners joining the Paychex family. And, given Paychex's extensive product suite, financial strength, and access to capital, we can help expand Advance Partners' product offering and accelerate client growth.""He also believes that ""the temporary staffing business is going to continue to grow, due in part to ever-increasing government regulation, including the Affordable Care Act and newly proposed overtime rules. Paychex is uniquely positioned to bring our regulatory expertise to staffing firms.""The buyout will enhance Paychex's roughly 600,000-strong client base apart from expanding its services.The company's initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging. Some of the notable ones completed over the years include SurePayroll and ePlan.The SurePayroll buyout added user-friendly online software-as-a-service (SaaS) payroll solutions specifically targeted at small businesses to Paychex's portfolio and increased market share.With ePlan Services' under its wing, the company now offers better clarity about fee structures to financial advisers as the market shifts toward full disclosure models in keeping with consumer and legislative demand.Further, one of the key secular growth drivers of Paychex is the demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost-cutting potential. Moreover, the growing regulatory burden on small companies signifies that the need to outsource non-core activities is increasing.The company seeks to capitalize on this opportunity by introducing products and services regularly for upselling to the client base and moving into the mid-market.However, sluggish economic growth and a possible rise in interest rates remain concerns. Moreover, intensifying competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing Inc.  and Insperity Inc.  may add to trouble.Currently, Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the staffing and outsourcing services space is Hudson Global, Inc.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 reported mixed results for second-quarter fiscal 2016 wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but top line missed the same. Nevertheless, the company marked year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Earnings of 52 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and jumped 10.6% from the year-ago quarter mainly backed by higher revenues.Paychex reported total revenue (including Interest on funds held for clients) of $722.million, up 7% year over year. However, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $724 million. Excluding interest on funds held for clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) grew 7% year over year to $711.3 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 4% from the year-ago period to $427.4 million, primarily on the back of higher revenue per check and client base.Human Resource Services segment revenues rose 11% year over year to $283.9 million mainly driven by solid growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services.Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $11.1 million primarily benefiting from a 1% rise in average investment balances backed by growth in client base.Paychex's total expenses increased 5% from the year-ago figure to $428.2 million due to 6% rise in compensation-related expenditure. However, total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, decreased 70 basis points (bps) to 59.3%.Consequently, Paychex's operating margin expanded 70 bps to 40.7%. Moreover, in dollar terms, reported operating income increased 9% year over year to $294.2 million.Excluding interest on funds held for clients, Paychex's operating income came in at $283.1 million or 39.8% of total services revenue compared with $259.8 million or 39% a year ago.Net income came in at $189.2 million or 52 cents, up from $173 million or 47 cents reported last year.Paychex exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $476.4 million compared with $537.7 million at the end of the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt. The company generated operating cash flow of $419.9 million in the first half of fiscal 2016.During the first six months of fiscal 2016, Paychex repurchased approximately $62.9 million common stocks and paid $303.6 million as dividend.Paychex reiterated the fiscal 2016 outlook. Management continues to expect 4-5% year-over-year increase in Payroll Service revenues. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to grow in the range of 10-13%.Total service revenue is likely to increase 7-8%. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income are expected to remain flat. Net income is likely to be within 8-9%.Paychex reported mixed second-quarter results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Nonetheless, the company reiterated the optimistic fiscal 2016 guidance, signifying that it is relatively well-placed despite the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Moreover, we are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth.

 is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Dec 22. Last quarter, the payroll and human resource solutions provider posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.96%. It is worth noting that the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.03%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small- and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity remain the headwinds.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 51 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Carnival Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +12.20% and a Zacks Rank #3.NIKE Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It's also well extended from a flat base cleared in early October. The burger chain, which has raised its dividend every year since it first payout in 1976, offers a 3.1% yield.Maxim Integrated Products (  ), up nearly 20% year to date, is crafting a flat base. The chipmaker's sales have slowed the past five quarters, but earnings growth resumed in fiscal Q1 ended in September. Maxim pays a quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share, or $1.20 for the year, for a 3.2% annualized yield.Altria Group (  ) is also working on the bottom of what is so far shaping up to be a flat base. Shares of the Marlboro maker have advanced about 17% this year. Tobacco companies tend to pay high dividends, and Altria is no exception, with an annual payout of 3.9%.Paychex (  ) has gained around 15% YTD and has pulled back near a 51.82 buy point and its 10-week moving average. The provider of payroll and related services offers a 3.2% yield. Analysts expect EPS to rise 9% on 7% higher sales when it reports Dec. 22.Lockheed Martin (LMT), up about 12% this year, has also pulled back to its 10-week line and a recent buy point at 213.44.

We consider that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.However, increased investment in new and innovative products, sluggish macroeconomic conditions and severe competition from other players in the space has made this sector a very tough one to be in for the short term.

Among the largest underlying components of USMV, in trading today Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is up about 0.3%, United Parcel Service Inc (Symbol: UPS) is up about 0.6%, and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (Symbol: AVB) is relatively unchanged.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of USMV, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, USMV's low point in its 52 week range is $26.41 per share, with $42.72 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $42.15. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: USMV, PAYX, UPS, AVB@2015-12-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-usmv-payx-ups-avb-2015-12-09
Shutterstock photoI nvestors concerned with limiting risk while building wealth over time should take a look at big-cap stockPaychex (  ). The provider of payroll and human resources services is benefiting from steady job growth and an increase in clients seeking help in navigating ObamaCare reforms.The stock is up 17% this year, easily outperforming the S&P 500, which is up only slightly. Paychex is at a new high and in a buying range above a 51.82 buy point of a long base.In addition, Paychex boasts a respectable long-term dividend growth rate of 6%. The current annual payout of $1.68 a share works out to an annualized yield of about 3%, above the S&P 500 average of around 2%.Paychex has a Composite Rating of 94, based on five IBD metrics. That rating puts it among the leaders in the Commercial Services-Outsourcing industry group, which has risen 22 places in the past six weeks to No. 41 out of 197 as of Wednesday's IBD.Cintas (  ), a supplier of company uniforms, is probably Paychex's closest competitor in the group. It boasts a Composite Rating of 90, a whopping 64% long-term dividend growth rate and solid stock-price gains this year.But the key word for Paychex is stability. It leads the group with a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of zero to 99, with zero being most stable. Profit in the fiscal year that ends in May is expected to rise 10% to $2.04 a share, followed the next year by an 8% increase, equal to the company's three-year earnings growth rate.Furthermore, its annual pretax margin of nearly 39% and return on equity of about 38% dwarfs Cintas' and suggests that Paychex has the firepower to keep raising its dividend.Paychex most recently raised its quarterly payout on July 9, a hike of 4 cents or 11%, to 42 cents a share. Also, while many companies slashed their dividends during the 2008-09 recession, Paychex held its steady -- and Cintas actually raised its own.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Top Dividend Stock Paychex Rewards Patient Investors@2015-11-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-dividend-stock-paychex-rewards-patient-investors-2015-11-18

Shutterstock photoP aychex (  ) has recovered from an August sell-off and is edging closer to a 51.82 buy point that marks the high of a long consolidation.The stock was caught up in the multiday dive triggered by trouble in Chinese stock markets. The trouble culminated in the Dow Jones industrial average falling 1,000 points on the morning of Aug. 24. That brought Paychex 20% below a March high.Analysts had not particularly warmed up to the company. In July, Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from buy to neutral. In August, JPMorgan Chase maintained a neutral rating.The catalyst for Paychex's recovery was a Sept. 30 earnings report that beat estimates. The company reported fiscal 2016 first-quarter EPS of 58 cents vs. estimates of 51 cents.CEO Martin Mucci said the company saw good growth in its payroll and human-resource service businesses. The stock rose nearly 4% that day and has been on the upswing since then.The company provides payroll, human-resource and employee-benefit outsourcing for employers. It targets small and midsize businesses. As of May 31, it had 590,000 payroll clients across 100 locations.It claims to pay one out of every 15 American private-sector worker.It's a growth industry, as small employers become burdened with more complex and frequently changing regulations. ObamaCare has forced many small employers to turn to outsourcers.The Labor Department also made proposals to change overtime rules next year to include more white-collar workers that will complicate employers' decision making.On July 9, Paychex raised its quarterly dividend from 38 to 42 cents a share, which works out to a 3.3% annualized yield at the stock's current price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Gains On Stellar Earnings Report@2015-10-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-gains-stellar-earnings-report-2015-10-13
lobal stock markets have been particularly volatile lately. This is mostly due to economic uncertainty and growing concerns about the possibility of a global recession reaching to the U.S in the coming months. With the economy in China slowing down and emerging-market currencies showing rising volatility, it's hard to tell what can happen to the global economy in the middle term.Watching economic indicators can be important, however, companies in key sectors of the economy can many times provide enormously valuable insights in this area.  can offer first-hand information about consumer trends and discretionary spending, while payroll processor  is permanently taking the pulse of the job market.When it comes to taking a look at the health of the global consumer, food and snacks giant  clearly knows what is going on around the world, and  has a big presence in many key cities in China.With this in mind, let's take a look at what top executives at Vail Resorts, Paychex, PepsiCo, and Yum!

ayroll and human resource solutions provider,  is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Sep 30. Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. It is worth noting that Paychex has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.1%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Paychex reported decent fourth-quarter results wherein the bottom line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line beat the same. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, both revenues and earnings increased.Also, we are encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives, such as joint ventures and acquisitions, support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide growth opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity remain headwinds.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 51 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Constellation Brands Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +3.05% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +6.17% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"""Let every man, every corporation, and especially let every village, town, and city, every county and State, get out of debt and keep out of debt,"" President Rutherford B. Hayes once said. ""It is the debtor that is ruined by hard times.""The Great Recession and 2008-09 financial crisis showed just how right he was.Whether it was homebuyers who took on mortgages they had little chance of paying, or governments that piled up mountains of IOUs, or companies that had leveraged themselves to the hilt, debt weighed like an anchor on borrowers when the economy turned south and the financial crisis hit.While many governments are still overloaded on debt, private US citizens and corporate America have dramatically scaled down their debt loads over the last few years. And that's very good news. I've spent more than a dozen years studying history's most successful investors, including Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch and Benjamin Graham, and I've found that the most common factor these gurus looked at when buying stocks wasn't price/earnings ratios or earnings growth rates or returns on equity. It was debt. Of the 11 investing greats upon whom I base my Guru Strategies, at least 9 used debt as a key component of their approaches - the less debt a company carried, the more likely the guru was to invest in it.That's not to say that they all used the same exact approach when analyzing debt. Buffett, for example, has targeted companies that generate enough earnings to pay off all their existing debt within five years (and preferably within two years). Graham, the man known as the Father of Value Investing, focused on companies whose long-term debt was less than the value of their net current assets. Several other gurus, like Lynch, used the debt/equity ratio. Even in those cases, the debt/equity standards were different - some used a fixed target percentage over which a company should not go, while others, such as Martin Zweig, looked for companies whose debt/equity was lower than their industry averages.The bottom line is that the vast majority of these highly successful investors were leery of companies that carried a lot of debt.There's more to buying a stock than just looking at a company's debt, of course. All of the gurus I follow looked at a variety of different metrics in combination with debt levels. Here's a look at a few companies in the U.S. whose light debt loads and strong other fundamentals make them favorites of my models. In fiscal 2009 REX completed its transformation out of retail and into the alternative energy industry. It has interests in several ethanol production facilities in the Midwest and Northern US. REX gets strong interest from Kenneth Fisher-based model, which likes its 0.8 price/sales ratio, lack of any long-term debt, and $15.68 in free cash per share. This Indianapolis-based retailer of athletic shoes, apparel and accessories has approximately 1,010 Finish Line branded locations, primarily in U.S. malls and shops inside Macy's department stores. The $900-million-market-cap's shares tumbled in late September after it announced disappointing second-quarter sales results. But my Benjamin Graham-based model thinks the market was too hard on the stock. Graham was a very conservative investor, and this approach looks for companies with good liquidity (current ratio of at least 2.0) and a strong balance sheet (long-term debt should not exceed net current assets). FINL has a 2.7 current ratio, and no long-term debt. It also trades for just 12.9 times three-year average earnings, and just 1.5 times book value, representing good value, according to the Graham-based approach. This Nashville-based specialty retailer ($1.4B market cap) sells footwear, headwear, sports apparel and accessories in more than 2,800 retail stores and leased departments throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, under such names as Journeys, Schuh, Lids, and Johnston & Murphy.Genesco has grown EPS at a 16.3% long-term rate. (I use an average of the three-, four-, and five-year EPS growth rates to determine a long-term rate.) That helps it earn strong interest from the model I base on the writings of mutual fund legend Peter Lynch. Lynch liked conservatively financed firms, and the model I base on his writings targets companies with debt/equity ratios less than 80%. Genesco's D/E is 11%, a good sign. Lynch also famously used the P/E-to-Growth ratio to find bargain-priced growth stocks, and when we divide Genesco's 14.6 price/earnings ratio by that long-term growth rate, we get a P/E/G of 0.9. This model considers anything below 1.0 to be a bargain.Genesco also gets strong interest from my Benjamin Graham-based model. It has a 2.2 current ratio, and about $516 million in net current assets vs. $95 million in long-term debt. It also trades for just 14.6 times earnings, and just 1.4 times book value. This Michigan-based firm provides business analytics, cloud computing, IT infrastructure management, and other services. Syntel ($4B market cap) has no long-term debt, impressing my Buffett-based model. My Buffett-based model also looks for firms with lengthy histories of earnings growth and high returns on equity (which is a sign of the ""durable competitive advantage"" Buffett is known to seek). Syntel's EPS have dipped in only one year of the past decade and its 10-year average ROE is an impressive 29.5%. Based in Rochester, NY, this firm is a provider of integrated payroll, human resource, insurance, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. It has an $18 billion market cap.While companies in the business services industry on average have a 57% debt/equity ratio, Paychex's D/E ratio is 0%, impressing my Martin Zweig-based model. This approach also looks for firms whose earnings aren't just growing, but growing at an accelerating rate, and PAYX delivers. The firm grew earnings per share at a 23% rate in the most recent quarter (vs. the year-ago quarter), up from an average of 8% in the previous three quarters (compared to the 3 year-ago quarters).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Five Stocks With Balance Sheets The Gurus Would Like@2015-10-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/five-stocks-balance-sheets-gurus-would-2015-10-13

"What's the one thing that could put GM's 30-million plus auto recalls cleanly in the rearview mirror? How about a scandal involving .What's the one thing that could put GM's 30-million plus auto recalls cleanly in the rearview mirror? How about a scandal involving  .Sometimes one company's pain is the gain of another. In this instance the loss of consumer trust stemming from Volkswagen's stunning admission that it ""cheated"" on diesel engine emissions tests by using software designed to subvert the tests could be just enough for shareholders to hit the gas on GM again. It's also worth noting that bad PR in the auto industry rarely lasts more than a few quarters, so GM's brand image with consumers was likely due to stabilize in the near-term anyway.Beyond just benefiting from Volkswagen's miscues, GM has other factors working in its favor. After waiting more than a half decade to redesign its GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado, the 2014 debuts of both vehicles have led to a surge in sales. After tallying 480,414 Silverados sold in the U.S. in 2013, and 184,389 Sierras, the Silverado looks to be on pace to eclipse 550,000 sales in 2015, and the Sierra could make a run at 225,000 vehicles. Updated aesthetics, improved durability, and better fuel mileage are key reasons why GM's trucks are selling better.As long as we remain in a low lending rate environment, which makes vehicles more affordable, and crude oil stays near multi-year lows, keeping prices at the pump down, GM and its forward P/E of six and dividend yield of nearly 5% are probably going to remain quite the attraction.Rising healthcare costs got your down? Let a healthcare real estate investment trust cheer you right up! HCP is a REIT that invests in and leases out buildings in the healthcare field, including hospitals, skilled nursing and long-term care facilities, life science and biotech research office buildings, and even senior housing.Source: Flickr user Vic.Think about this for a moment: we have an aging U.S. population that's living longer than ever, and healthcare spending is expected to reaccelerate to a growth rate of 5.8% per year between now and 2024. That represents a major money-making opportunity for all facets of the healthcare sector, from drug developers to senior housing businesses. And what better way to take advantage of this push for extra spending than to build a real estate portfolio filled with these assets?Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's continued accommodative stance on interest rates appears poised to ease the pain of top dividend stocks like HCP. Although I believe it's a bad move for traders, as lending rates rise it's commonplace for income investors to abandon dividend-paying stocks in favor of safer growth prospects, such as CDs or bonds. With the Fed likely targeting only a 2% federal funds rate, and potentially taking years to get there, I doubt that high-yield REITs like HCP will be cast to the backburner anytime soon.Consider HCP and its nearly 6% yield among your top dividend stocks to consider for October.Another strong candidate to put extra money in your pocket is payroll processing provider Paychex (say that three times fast, I dare you!).Source: Paychex.I suspect there are two big catalysts headed Paychex's way that could wind up benefiting its business in a big way. First, the U.S. economy has been on a six-year long rebound, resulting in the lowest unemployment rate (5.1% in August) since April 2008, when the U.S. could even claim a 5% unemployment rate. More working Americans, be it part-time or full-time, means more payrolls processed for Paychex. In the company's most recent quarterly report, it recorded an 8% year-over-year revenue jump and a 10% rise in EPS, so you could certainly suggest it's firing on all cylinders.The other catalyst is that an eventual rising rate environment is going to be a nice benefit for payroll processing services like Paychex. The businesses that Paychex services often transfer the funds to cover employee paychecks days or weeks in advance of payday. Paychex doesn't just twiddle its thumbs, so to speak, with this cash -- it actively invests this lump sum in safe, short-term, fixed income investment tools and securities that allow it to boost its net income. Even if the Fed only boosts rates by 1.5% to 2% over the next three years, it could make a substantial difference in Paychex's interest-based investment income.Currently yielding 3.6%, Paychex is a top dividend that I'd encourage you to consider for October.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year! Once you learn how to take advantage of all these loopholes, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

"Shutterstock photoP aycom Software is a pretty small fish in a pretty big pond of payroll and human resources software, competing against much larger players like Automated Data Processing (  ), Ceridian and Paychex.Even so,Paycom (  ) doesn't have much problem delivering robust financial returns or taking share away from the big boys.This hasn't gone unnoticed by investors, who pushed Paycom's stock price to new highs this week.The company offers cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software delivered as Software as a Service.Its gear provides functionality and data analytics that businesses can use to manage the complete employment life cycle, from recruitment to retirement. It also offers tools to help clients manage ObamaCare plans. Most of its business comes from small and midsize firms.Paycom's HCM software features a suite of applications that range from employment applicant tracking and background checks to time and labor management, payroll and tax management, performance management and employee learning and training.There's plenty of competition in this field. Besides big players likeADP (  ),Paychex (  ) and privately held Ceridian, other companies that offer HCM tools include smaller (for now) outfits such asUltimate Software Group (  ),Workday (  ),Cornerstone On Demand (CSOD) andPaylocity Holding (PCTY).Even software companies that don't specialize in payroll or HR are moving into the HCM space.""Salesforce.com (CRM) is continuing to build out its product offering, andSAP (SAP) has exposure to the human capital management side of things,"" Morningstar analyst Peter Wahlstrom told IBD. (Salesforce is scheduled to disclose its second-quarter results after the market closes Thursday.)With only $151 million in sales last year, Paycom is dwarfed by multi-billion-dollar companies such as ADP. But it's still carving out market share thanks to the strength of its technology, analysts say.""Paycom is chipping away at the fringe of the traditional payroll processing market,"" Wahlstrom said. ""Certainly the Software-as-a-Service model is something that a lot of newer companies are looking for. A lot of new customers are spending incrementally with Paycom that would not be spending with ADP or Ceridian because a lot of the functionality does not exist on those platforms.""On a Q2 conference call with analysts earlier this month, Paycom CEO Chad Richison said his company is ""relentlessly focused on software development.""In addition to rolling out new applications, he said, Paycom also continues ""to deepen the functionality within each of our existing offerings. As a result, we once again more than doubled our research and development expenditures"" during the second quarter by growing them 103% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis.It's hard to argue with Paycom's results. It went public just last year, but has a yearslong streak of 33%-or-better revenue growth.After the close on Aug. 4, Paycom reported Q2 revenue of $49 million, up 47% from the prior year and above consensus analyst estimates for $45.8 million.Recurring revenue climbed 46% and made up 97.6% of the total. Annualized new recurring revenue gained 43% to $16.5 million. The company also raised its full-year sales outlook.Second-quarter earnings more than tripled from a year earlier to 10 cents a share -- topping views by 4 cents -- while adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $13.1 million. GAAP net income hit $5.9 million vs. $593,000 lost a year earlier.The day after reporting earnings, Paycom's stock price shot up 18% to 37.85. Shares set a record high of 41.36 this past Monday.The company's Q2 results were helped by a rising volume of larger deals, JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted in a report.""Management also highlighted good initial traction for two new products released in the quarter and reported encouraging deal wins with its Learning module, which was launched last quarter,"" Murphy said. ""The continued strong results solidify our belief that Paycom is in a position to capture market share and increase long-term shareholder value.""The market share gains will be partly driven by the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, which has added another layer of complexity to health benefits processing. Paycom's cloud-based products help clients manage changes under the ACA.In December, the company rolled out a new dashboard for its ACA software that lets customers more easily navigate. During the second quarter it added an enhanced ACA compliance offering with greater functionality for clients, CEO Richison said on the conference call.Based on feedback from monthly ACA webinars, he said, businesses ""are more concerned than ever by the employer mandate reporting requirements. With this in mind, we set out to aid eight businesses in their pursuit to better monitor, report and evaluate the organizational needs in order to comply with this significant piece of health-care reform.""Paycom is an IBD 50 stock with a 98 Composite Rating. It's the highest rated issue in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 46 out of 197 industries tracked.

 recently reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, wherein it incurred an adjusted loss per share of 23 cents (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization and other one-time items) from continuing operations. Though the figure was wider than the year-ago quarter loss of 15 cents, it was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 25 cents.On a GAAP basis, Intuit's loss from continuing operations widened to 37 cents per share from 10 cents incurred a year ago mainly due to higher operating expenses.Revenues of $696 million came below the guided range of $720-$745 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $740 million. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 7.2% mainly on the back of Intuit's ongoing transformation into a global cloud company.Services and Other revenues grew 7.2% year over year to $415 million, while product revenues improved 7.3% to $281 million.Segment-wise, Small Business Group recorded 5% year-over-year decline due to changes in desktop offerings as the company continues to focus on online solutions. Total desktop ecosystem revenue declined year over year as a result of 14% drop in desktop units.The company added 110,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers during the quarter bringing the total to 1075,000.Coming to the operational metrics, Intuit reported adjusted gross profit of $528 million, up 8% year over year mainly supported by higher revenues and lower cost of sales as a percentage of sales. Consequently, gross margin expanded 60 basis points (bps) to 75.9%.The company reported 14.6% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating expenses primarily due to higher research & development, selling and marketing and general & administrative expenditure.Higher operating expenses led to an adjusted operating loss of $86 million, which compared unfavorably with $47 million operating loss suffered a year ago.Intuit posted adjusted net loss from continuing operations (including share-based compensation but excluding amortization and other one-time items) of $67.2 million or 23 cents per share as against net loss of $42.6 million or 15 cents in the year-ago quarter.The maker of tax-preparation software TurboTax exited fiscal 2015 with cash and investments of $808 million. Long-term debt stood at $500 million at the end of fiscal year. Further, Intuit generated cash flow of $1.504 billion from operating activities. During the fiscal year, the company repurchased shares worth $1.245 billion and had roughly $2.6 billion remaining under the share buyback authorization.Intuit issued weak top-line guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2016. The company expects revenues in the range of $4.525-$4.600 billion in fiscal 2016. The mid-point of $4.563 billion is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.025 billion.Non-GAAP operating income is projected within $1.45 billion to $1.48 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected between $3.40 and $3.45. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.24.For the first quarter, the company expects to incur non-GAAP loss per share between 3 cents and 4 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 8 cents.Further, the company expects revenues in the range of $660-$680 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $776 million.Intuit concluded fiscal 2015 on a dismal note. Although revenues grew on a year-over-year basis, loss widened. Moreover, the company issued weak top-line guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2016.Nevertheless, we are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will boost the segment. The increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive.Intuit has also restructured its business to focus more on QuickBooks services. The company expects to continue to invest in the portfolio, which is likely to impact its near-term profitability.Moreover, the rising competition from payroll solution providers such as Paychex Inc.  and Automatic Data Processing  is a concern, in our view, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Paychex Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Monday, shares of PAYX entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $41.59 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Paychex Inc, the RSI reading has hit 26.6 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 31.9. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, PAYX's recent annualized dividend of 1.68/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 3.68% based upon the recent $45.69 share price. A bullish investor could look at PAYX's 26.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on PAYX is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately in the range of $44 million to $46 million.Paycom Software reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2015 results and provided an encouraging third-quarter and fiscal 2015 revenue guidance. Also, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favorable. The results were driven by a shift toward cloud-based offerings and new client additions.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives.We believe that higher traction of Paycom Software's Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind for the company in the long run. Also, Paycom Software might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which will boost revenues, going forward.Nevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation  , Intuit Inc.  and Paychex, Inc.  remains a headwind.Currently, Paycom Software has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Shutterstock photoU ltimate Software Group has made no secret of its intention to become a $1 billion company in 2018 -- a lofty goal for a firm that logged just over $500 million in revenue last year and competes against much larger outfits like Oracle and Automated Data Processing (  ).GivenUltimate 's (  ) current growth trajectory, however, the goal looks well within reach.The company makes workforce management software designed to help clients better manage employee services such as payroll, benefits, recruiting, performance management and time management.Its main product is UltiPro, software that manages the employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Ultimate delivers it via the Internet cloud and mainly focuses on two customer types: enterprise companies with 1,000 or more employees, and mid-market companies with fewer than 1,000 employees.Ultimate competes in the human capital management (HCM) market. It's a crowded field that includes payroll and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software firmsOracle (  ) andADP (  ) as well asPaychex (  ) and Ceridian, which is partly owned byFidelity National Financial (  ).Ultimate's ability to compete for business is borne out in its financial results. The company has put together a years-long streak of 20% or better revenue growth. More importantly, it has grown recurring revenue -- business that is likely to continue in the future -- by at least 25% per year for 14 straight years.The company boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99. Ultimate stock set a new high of 187.79 on Wednesday.Based on customer surveys, Ultimate's success in landing new business is due to a variety of different factors, says CEO Scott Scherr. Among other things, they include Ultimate's culture, the functionality of its products and the quality of the reporting, analytics and business intelligence that the company's customers receive.""Our goal is to innovate all the time -- to make the product better all the time and to make the service better all the time,"" Scherr told IBD.Ultimate also benefits from its growing brand recognition and its expertise as a payroll provider, especially in the mid-market, notes JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy.The company ""stands out as one of few SaaS companies growing above 20% with a double-digit operating margin, and it demonstrated impressive business model resilience during the last U.S. recession,"" Murphy noted in a recent research report. ""We expect consistent execution with recurring revenue growth in the low- to mid-20s as we see ample runway for Ultimate to attract a couple hundred new customers per year.""In addition to strong recurring revenue growth, Ultimate also boasts a customer retention rate of around 97%, Scherr says.""Recurring revenue is the holy grail -- it's what we depend on to maintain our momentum,"" he said.""When you have 97% retention of that revenue, it's obviously a good business model,"" Scherr added. ""Our goal now is to become a $1 billion company in 2018, and I think we are firmly on track for that.""In a second-quarter earnings note, Murphy said that Ultimate management can ""taste"" the $1 billion revenue mark. He cited ""strong momentum of bookings, the pace of hiring, evidence of larger deals and excitement around pipelines.""Ultimate reported Q2 recurring revenue of $124.4 million, up 22% from the prior year. Overall revenue climbed 21% to $147.2 million, topping the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Recurring revenue made up 84% of the total, with the rest coming from support services provided to clients.Ultimate's quarterly earnings rose 35% to 62 cents a share, also above estimates.""It was the best sales quarter in our history, which followed Q1, which had been the best in history,"" Scherr said. ""There is definitely momentum in the business right now, and we're just trying to take advantage of that as long as we can.""One way it looks to take advantage is by beefing up its workforce, particularly its sales team.""We are adding 50 people a month, which says something about our growth,"" Scherr said.Once it hires someone, Ultimate has a 93% employee retention rate, he says.The company gets about 60% of its employees from in-house referrals. The rest are evenly split between Ultimate's postings of jobs on job boards and its Tech Stars and Rising Stars internship program.Meanwhile, Ultimate looks for another boost from a partnership that it inked in March withNetSuite (N), a provider of ERP cloud services.Under terms of the deal, the two companies will integrate Ultimate's UltiPro HCM solution and NetSuite's ERP suite as a way of letting joint customers manage a host of different tasks, including financials, supply chain, CRM, payroll, human relations and talent management.In addition, NetSuite will refer HCM/payroll opportunities to Ultimate, which will in turn send ERP/financial leads to NetSuite.The two closed six joint deals during the second quarter. Around 100 joint deals remain in the pipeline. CEO Scherr calls it ""the perfect deal"" to help both companies.""They are not in our business, and we are not in their business,"" he said. ""Our businesses complement each other. They built a better mousetrap in what they do, and we built a better mousetrap in what we do. It has a tremendous benefit to us. It helps both companies against a certain type of competition, which is ERP.""Scherr also called the partnership ""one of the things that helps us break through $1 billion in 2018.""The bottom line is also forecast to see decent growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ultimate to increase annual EPS 18% this year and 23% in 2016.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Is Ultimate Software On Track To $1 Billion In Sales?@2015-08-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ultimate-software-track-1-billion-sales-2015-08-07

 reported fourth-quarter and fiscal 2015 results. Quarterly earnings from continuing operations came in at 55 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Earnings also decreased 12.7% year over year.For fiscal 2015, the company's earnings from continuing operations came in at $2.89 a share, up from $2.57 reported in fiscal 2014.Quarterly revenues of $2,694.5 million came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,737 million but grew 5% year over year. For fiscal 2015, the company reported revenues of $10.9 billion, up 7% from fiscal 2014.Employer Services revenues in the quarter increased 2% year over year to $2,176.9 million. PEO Services revenues rose 16% year over year to $678 million.In the quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for the company grew 18% year over year. New business bookings represent annualized recurring revenues expected from new orders. In fiscal 2015, worldwide new business bookings increased 13% over fiscal 2014 levels.Interest on funds held for clients in the quarter remained flat on a year-over-year basis at $95 million. The company's average client funds balance increased 4% year over year to $22.6 billion in the quarter while average interest yield was 1.7%.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 4.8% year over year to $2.33 billion, attributable to higher selling, general & administrative expense, operating expenses and systems development & programming costs.Automatic Data Processing exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term marketable securities) of approximately $1.7 billion compared with $3.6 billion as on Jun 30, 2014. Long-term debt was $9.2 million compared with $11.5 million as on Jun 30, 2014.For fiscal 2016, the company expects revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 9% over fiscal 2015. The company expects revenue growth in the first and second quarters to be lower than the second half of the fiscal. Further, the company expects earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% from $2.89 per share in fiscal 2015.This represents 50 basis points (bps) expansion in pre-tax margin from 18.9% in fiscal 2015. Worldwide new business bookings are expected to rise approximately 8% to 10% from $1.6 billion sold in fiscal 2015.Employer Services revenues are expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6% including the negative impact of foreign currency. This represents pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 100 bps. The company expects pay per control to increase 2% to 3% in the year.PEO Services revenues are expected to increase 15% to 17%. Pre-tax margin is expected to grow 50 bps year over year.In addition, the company expects interest on funds held for clients to increase $5 million to $15 million or 1% to 4%, driven by estimated growth in average client funds balances of 3% to 5% to $22.5 billion to $22.9 billion. Average interest yield is expected to be flat at 1.7%.Further, the total contribution from client funds extended investment strategy is estimated to grow $10 million over last fiscal.Automatic Data Processing is expected to gain on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. The company's retention rate of 90% has created a huge recurring revenue base, which is expected to be a major positive going forward. The firms believe that the spin-off of its dealer services segment will enable the company to focus more on its HCM (human capital management) solutions.In addition, Automatic Data Processing's higher revenue per client and lower cost of operations will place it in an advantageous position, going forward. Moreover, we expect the company to deliver top-line growth with rising demand in payroll processing and human resource administration solutions along with new offerings in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) space.However, a volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc.  and Equifax Inc.  are the near-term headwinds. ADP's growth is significantly dependent on employment levels. The sluggish global macro-economic recovery rate post the great recession has affected overall employment rate. This does not bode well for ADP.Moreover, as ADP earns interest income on funds held on behalf of clients, lower interest rates are hurting its top line. This will remain a major concern going forward.Currently, Automatic Data Processing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in this sector is Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 2016 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PAYX options chain for the new March 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $44.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $42.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PAYX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $47.24/share today.Because the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.52% return on the cash commitment, or 5.34% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, and highlighting in green where the $44.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $48.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of PAYX stock at the current price level of $47.24/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $48.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.89% if the stock gets called away at the March 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PAYX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Paychex Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $48.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $48.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 4.97% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 17%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 16%.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 and full year results on Jul 30. Last quarter, it posted positive earnings surprise of 1.96%. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 2.06% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Automatic Data Processing is expected to gain on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. The company's retention rate of 90% has created a huge recurring revenue base, which is expected to be a major positive in the to-be-reported quarter. The firms believe that the spin-off of its dealer services segment will enable the company to focus more on its HCM (human capital management) solutions.In addition, Automatic Data Processing's higher revenue per client and lower cost of operations will place it in an advantageous position, going forward. Moreover, we expect the company to deliver top-line growth in the fourth quarter with rising demand in payroll processing and human resource administration solutions along with new offerings in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) space.However, a volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc.  and Equifax Inc.  are the near-term headwinds. ADP's growth is significantly dependent on employment levels. The sluggish global macro-economic recovery rate post the great recession has affected overall employment rate. This does not bode well for ADP.Moreover, as ADP earns interest income on funds held on behalf of clients, lower interest rates are hurting its top line. This will remain a major concern going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Automatic Data Processing will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Automatic Data Processing currently has a 0.00% ESP because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 59 cents. Automatic Data Processing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold),which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company that has the right combination of elements, according to our model, to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +6.45% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

he  website TechCrunch recently reported that the financial services provider,  , laid off 399 employees or approximately 5% of the total workforce of 8,000 as of Jul 31, 2014. Though the reason behind the retrenchment is not clear, we believe that it is a step toward shifting its business model from selling computer discs to a cloud-based software licensing model.In the second half of 2014, the company terminated over 550 employees because of the shift in the business model.Intuit provides business and financial management solutions to small and medium businesses (SMB), accounting professionals, and consumers in the United States. The company's objective is to expand the world of electronic finance.Electronic finance encompasses three types of products and services - desktop software products that operate on customers' personal computers to automate financial tasks; products and services that are delivered via the Internet; and products and services that connect Internet-based services with desktop software to enable customers to integrate their financial activities.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will continue to support the segment. The increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive factor.The company has also restructured its business to focus more on QuickBooks services and plans to invest more in the portfolio. Thus, higher investments will impact the company's profitability in the near term.Further, we believe that the rising competition from other payroll solution providers such as Paychex Inc.  and Automatic Data Processing  is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"he fact that Q2 estimates came down over the last three months is not something unique to this period. This has been the norm for quite some time now and has become particularly entrenched over the last couple of years as management teams have been consistently providing weak guidance, causing estimates to come down.One could cite a variety of reasons for why the tone and substance of management guidance has been this week lately, but the most logical though cynical explanation is that management teams have a big incentive to manage expectations. After all, it pays to under-promise and over-deliver.The chart below shows this trend clearly. The dark green column shows the earnings growth expected at the start of the quarter; the orange column shows the growth rate expected by the time the earnings season gets underway and the shaded green column shows the actual growth achieved that quarter. For 2015 Q2, we started out at an estimated earnings decline of -4.3% on March 31st, with the earnings drop estimate going further down to -7.3% as of today. But if history is any guide, then the actual growth rate will likely be in the vicinity of where we started out in early April. Other than 2014 Q4, this has been the pattern repeatedly in recent quarters.But if Q2 earnings growth does end up around where we started the quarter, then it will be the lowest earnings growth pace in quite a while.Keep in mind however that while the trend of negative revisions is no different from other recent periods, the magnitude of negative revisions for 2015 Q2 is notably lower relative to what we saw ahead of the Q1 earnings season.The chart below shows the magnitude of negative revisions for each quarter since 2013 Q2. As you can see, the magnitude of negative revisions for 2015 Q2 (shaded orange bar: -3.2%) is materially below what saw in 2015 Q1 (-8.3%) and 2014 Q4 (-5.9%). Please note that the 'average' represents the average for the 7-quarter period through 2015 Q1.Bottom line, estimates for Q2 have not fallen as much as had been the trend in the last couple of quarters. But they are nevertheless down. The revisions trend is broad based, with estimates for most sectors down from early January. The Energy sector's travails are fairly well understood, but estimates for other sectors have come down quite a bit as well.The chart below identifies the major sectors that have suffered pronounced negative revisions.The table below presents the summary picture for Q2 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2015 Q1 earnings season.This pronounced downshift in estimates has prompted some on Wall Street to start claiming that the revisions trend may have a gone bit too much; meaning that estimates have likely become too low. Hard to find a basis for such a claim in real time, particularly given the global growth woes and still-high U.S dollar. But we will find soon enough as actual Q2 results start coming in.We will get results from more than 20 companies this week, including 5 S&P 500 members. Key reports this week include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). But as you can see in the chart below of weekly reporting calendar for companies in the S&P 500 index, we will have to wait another couple of weeks for the Q2 reporting cycle to really ramp up. :  : For a complete analysis of 2015 Q2 estimates and actual result for the preceding results, please check out weekly

hareholders of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 3.1% annualized dividend yield can sell the December covered call at the $49 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.50 bid, which annualizes to an additional 6.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 9.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $49 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but PAYX shares would have to climb 1.4% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 4.5% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Paychex Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for PAYX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.1% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing PAYX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $49 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December covered call at the $49 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $49. (  ). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Paychex Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $48.32) to be 15%.

Shutterstock photoT he best income stocks offer dividend payouts that grow over time. Since companies must pay dividends out of what they earn, it pays to seek income stocks with strong future profit growth, even if they don't offer the highest current yield.Here's a look at five dividend leaders with double-digit earnings-per-share growth forecasts in the coming quarter.Analysts expect discount retailerTarget (  ) to report fiscal Q2  of 44% to $1.12 a share on roughly flat sales. It would mark a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. The stock is trading just below its 10-week moving average in a potential new shallow base.

Target has an annualized dividend yield of 2.6%.Restaurant operatorBrinker International (  ) is expected to reveal a 12% rise in fiscal Q4 profit ending in June, which would mark a 10th-straight quarter of double-digit profit growth. The company runs the Chili's and Maggiano's restaurant chains. Shares offer a 2% yield. The stock is basing but needs to build the right side before a pattern can take shape.Carnival (  ) stock is setting up just below a 48.66 buy point in a new  pattern. Analysts expect the cruise ship operator's next earnings report to show a 60% surge in per share growth. The stock has a current yield of 2.1%.Home Depot (  ) (2.1% yield) is building a flat-base pattern. Shares are about 5% below the 118.09 buy point. The home-improvement retailer has delivered double-digit profit growth the past five quarters. Analysts expect a 13% profit lift in fiscal Q2 ending in July.Paychex (  ) is expected to report 10% EPS growth this quarter, its strongest rise in five quarters.

ayroll and human resource solutions provider,  is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Jul 1. Last quarter, the company's earnings matched expectations. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Paychex reported decent third-quarter results wherein its bottom line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line beat the same. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, both revenues and earnings increased.We remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with additional opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing  and Insperity remain the possible headwinds for the company.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 44 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Constellation Brands Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.28% and holds a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 recently reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2015 results, turning around from loss incurred in consecutive three quarters.The company posted adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization and other one-time items) from continuing operations of $2.63 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58. However, quarterly earnings compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter earnings of $3.42.On a GAAP basis, Intuit's earnings declined to $1.78 per share from $3.39 reported in the year-ago period mainly due to lower revenues and higher expenses.Intuit's revenues of $2.194 billion came ahead of the company's own guidance range of $2.075 to $2.150 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.150 billion. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 8.1% due to poor performance at the company's product segment.Services and Other revenues grew 5.7% year over year to $1.747 billion, while product revenues declined 39.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million.Segment-wise, Small Business Group recorded 5% year-over-year decline due to changes in desktop offerings as the company continues to focus on online solutions. Total desktop ecosystem revenue declined 15% year over year due to a 23% drop in desktop units.However, QuickBooks Online subscribers surged 55% year over year adding more than 120,000 subscribers during the quarter. The company ended the quarter with total QuickBooks Online subscribers of 965,000.Nonetheless, management expects QuickBooks Online to add more subscribers despite the decline in desktop units.Coming to the operational metrics, Intuit reported adjusted gross profit of $1.986 billion, down 10.7% year over year mainly due to lower revenues and higher cost of sales. Consequently, gross margin contracted 260 basis points (bps) to 90.5%.The company reported 15.3% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating expenses primarily due to higher spending on research & development, selling and marketing and general & administrative expenses.Reduced revenues and increased expenses led to 23.1% decline year over year in operating income which came in at $1.159 billion. Consequently, operating margin trimmed 1,030 bps to 52.8%.Intuit's adjusted net income from continuing operations (including share-based compensation but excluding amortization and other one-time items) was approximately $744 million or $2.62 per share as against net income of nearly $993 million or $3.42 per share in the year-ago quarter.The maker of tax-preparation software TurboTax exited the quarter with cash and investments of $1.193 billion. Long-term debt remained flat sequentially at $499 million. Further, Intuit generated cash flow of $1.722 billion from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2015. During the first three quarters, Intuit repurchased shares worth $1.234 billion and has roughly $2.6 billion remaining under the share buyback authorization.Buoyed by better-than-expected third-quarter results, management raised the outlook for fiscal 2015. The company now expects revenues in the range of $4.395-$4.420 billion in fiscal 2015, up from the $4.275 to $4.375 billion range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.367 billion.Non-GAAP operating income is projected in the range of $1.12 to $1.14 billion compared with the $1.11 to $1.14 billion range. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected between $2.50 and $2.52, up from $2.45 to $2.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.91.However, for the fourth quarter, the company expects to incur higher loss. Intuit now anticipates incurring a non-GAAP loss per share between 10 cents and 12 cents, wider than 6 to 8 cents loss expected earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 19 cents.Nonetheless, the company has reiterated the revenue guidance range of $720-$745 million for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $737 million.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will continue to support the segment. The increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive factor. The company has also restructured its business to focus more on QuickBooks services. It expects to continue to invest in the QuickBooks portfolio. Thus, higher investments will impact the company's profitability in the near term.Moreover, we believe that the rising competition from other payroll solution providers such as Paychex Inc.  and Automatic Data Processing  is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF (Symbol: USMV) where we have detected an approximate $183.5 million dollar inflow -- that's a 3.7% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 119,400,000 to 123,800,000).

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@USMV, ABC, PAYX, MCD: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2015-05-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/usmv-abc-payx-mcd-large-inflows-detected-etf-2015-05-28

S ince dividends come out of a company's bottom line, looking for stocks with a steady earnings track record is a sound strategy. IBD's Dividend Leaders list consists of some of the most stable profit generators.

Shutterstock photoI nvestors don't always have to choose between growth and income.Paychex (  ) offers both. The Rochester, N.Y.-based provider of payroll and human resources products and services has delivered steady top- and bottom-line growth in recent years. Earnings rose 5% to 7% in the past four fiscal years, while sales grew by 4% to 8%. Paychex has a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).In late March, the company reported a fiscal third-quarter profit of 46 cents a share, up 5% from a year earlier. Revenue climbed 8% to $704.3 million. Sales from human resource services jumped 19% to $269.8 million. The company is also benefiting from the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.Paychex's earnings for fiscal 2015, ending in May, are slated to rise 8% to $1.85 a share. A 9% increase to $2.01 a share is expected in fiscal 2016. Both estimates were recently revised higher.Paychex pays out the bulk of its net income to shareholders as dividends. It paid $510.6 million in dividends for fiscal 2014 or 81% of net income. The company has paid a quarterly cash dividend since 1988.It last boosted its quarterly dividend in July, raising it to 38 cents a share from 35 cents. The firm typically pays in February, May, August and November.Paychex pays $1.52 a share on an annual basis, giving it a yield of about 3.1%. It has the second largest yield among the dividend-paying stocks in the Commercial Services-Outsourcing group.Crawford (CRDA), a thinly traded, low-priced issue, offers the highest yield at around 3.9%.In the past few weeks, Paychex has been tangling with its 10-week moving average as it forms a potential flat base. It had already staged a breakout from a flat base in late January. Although the stock had some ups and downs, it rose 7% past a 48.30 buy point before consolidating gains.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Leading Stock Paychex Offers Investors Growth, Income@2015-04-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/leading-stock-paychex-offers-investors-growth-income-2015-04-28
 reported third-quarter fiscal earnings of 2015 $1.04 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. Earnings also increased 16% year over year.Revenues of $3 billion came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate million but grew 7% year over year backed by strength in the human capital management business.Employer Services revenues increased 5% year over year to $2,474.7 million based on organic growth.PEO Services revenues rose 15% year over year to $748.5 million.In the quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for the company grew 6% year over year. New business bookings represent annualized recurring revenues expected from new orders.Interest on funds held for clients grew 1% year over year to $101 million. The growth was primarily due to 4% year-over-year growth in average client funds balances to $26.2 billion offset by a drop in average interest yield to 1.5%.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 5.8% year over year to $2.3 billion, attributable to higher selling, general & administrative expense, operating expenses and systems development & programming costs.Automatic Data Processing exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion compared with $3.6 billion as on Jun 30, 2014. Long-term debt was $9.7 million versus $11.5 million as on Jun 30, 2014.For fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues to grow in the range of 7% year over year. Further, the company expects earnings per share to grow 14% from $2.58 per share in fiscal 2014.This represents 75 basis points (bps) expansion in pre-tax margin from 18.4% in fiscal 2014. Worldwide new business bookings are expected to rise approximately 10% from $1.4 billion sold in fiscal 2014.Employer Services revenues are expected to grow approximately 5% year over year. This represents a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 100 bps. The company expects pay per control to increase 3% in the year.PEO Services revenues are expected to increase 16%. Pre-tax margin is expected to grow 100 bps year over year.In addition, the company expects interest on funds held for clients to increase $5 million or 1% driven by estimated growth in average client funds balances of 5% to $21.7 billion. However, the growth would be partially offset due to 10 bps decline in average interest yield to 1.7%.Further, the total contribution from client funds extended investment strategy is estimated to grow $5 million.We believe that the Dealer Services spin-off will help the company focus more on its relatively fast growing human capital management business. The company is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention.Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, a volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc.  and Equifax Inc.  are the near-term headwinds.Currently, Automatic Data Processing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 is set to report third quarter fiscal 2015 results on Apr 30. Last quarter, it posted a 2.94% surprise. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.11% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Automatic Data Processing reported modest second-quarter fiscal 2015 results. Though its earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the same. In addition, the company provided an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2015 with earnings projected to grow in double digits and revenues in high-single digits.In the quarter, ADP also started a 'center of excellence' in Bucharest, Romania. The new center is the company's global delivery center for HCM services. A robust product portfolio has allowed Automatic Data Processing to hold a premier position in the payroll processing and HCM market. The new center will further strengthen the company's prowess in the domain while opening up more avenues for growth.The company's high retention rate is a key factor that contributes to the huge recurring revenue base. In addition, the spin-off of its dealer services segment is a major positive as it enables the company to focus better on its HCM solutions. The ongoing recovery in the job market offers more reason for optimism.The company recently partnered with MotivAction Partners to aid companies in recognizing and engaging their employees. The company also launched ADP AdvancedMD Marketplace for driving innovation for private practices by providing them with efficient and reliable tools and services.ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, a volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc.  and Equifax Inc.  are the near-term headwinds.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ADP will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.02. Hence, the difference is of 0.00%. ADP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Skyworks Solutions Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2015-04-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-msci-usa-minimum-volatility-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2015-04-22

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.52), with the stock changing hands as low as $50.66 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Paychex Inc, looking at the history chart for PAYX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, PAYX makes up 2.18% of the First Trust RBA Quality Income ETF (Symbol: QINC) which is trading lower by about 0.2% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex (PAYX) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2015-03-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-payx-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2015-03-17

Shutterstock photoS teady earnings are of key importance to income investors, since dividends are a distribution of a company's profits. Here's a list of five Steady Eddies that meet IBD's top dividend stock criteria and have the most stable earnings in recent years.All five earn a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile). Their yields also outpace the S&P 500's average 1.88% payout.Two names from  focusing on  with high Relative Strength Ratings make this list too:Altria Group (  ) andReynolds American (  ). The tobacco companies currently pay $2.08 and $2.68 a share, respectively, on an annual basis, yielding 3.7% and 3.6%. Altria's long-term dividend growth rate is 8% and Reynold's is 9%.Paychex 's (  ) quarterly payout of 38 cents a share, or $1.52 annualized, works out to a 3.1% yield.

As such, it's a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which have boosted their dividend each year for at least the past 25 years. Colgate's dividend growth rate is 9%, and its five-year earnings growth rate is 5%.Home Depot (  ) rounds out the top five by yield. It recently raised its quarterly dividend by 26% to 59 cents a share, or $2.36 for the full year, for a 2% payout. Its dividend growth rate is tops of the five at 19%, and its five-year earnings growth rate is an impressive 23%. Home Depot has benefited from an improving economy and housing market. The stock's 93 RS Rating reflects a 9% advance so far this year. That's on top of a 27% run-up last year.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@5 Top Stocks That Never Fail To Pay Big Dividends@2015-03-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-stocks-never-fail-pay-big-dividends-2015-03-06

Shutterstock photoT imes have changed. No longer are utility, food and telecom companies the only ones that return cash to shareholders through dividends.A number of firms in many other industries also pay shareholder dividends. Two in the Dividend Leaders screen areMicrosoft (  ) andPaychex (  ).The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant has paid its stockholders dividends since 2003, which it has steadily increased over the years. It last announced a hike in September, when it raised the quarterly rate to 31 cents a share from 28 cents. Its dividend has grown more than 50% from levels in 2012.On an annual basis, Microsoft pays $1.24 a share, which works out to a yield of about 2.8%, or about 1% higher than the S&P 500's yield. Microsoft has the highest yield of the two dividend-paying stocks in the Computer Software-Desktop group.Monotype Imaging (  ), the other dividend payer in the group, has a yield of around 1.2%.Microsoft is bouncing back after selling off on earnings in late December.Paychex, which provides human resource and employee benefit services, has been paying shareholder dividends since 1988. It last announced an increase in July, raising its quarterly dividend to the current rate of 38 cents a share from 35 cents.The company tends to pay out a substantial part of net income as dividends. In its fiscal 2014, ended in May, it paid out 81% of net income in the form of dividends.Paychex pays shareholders $1.52 a share annually, which gives its stock a yield of about 3%. It has the second-highest yield in the Commercial Services-Outsourcing group. Shares of Paychex have risen for four straight weeks. They are still in buy range from a second pass above a 48.30 buy point from a flat base. Its first breakout in late December failed, but the second try is working.Crawford & Co.

"uick, think of a stock in the financial sector that you would feel comfortable buying and not selling for the next 25 years.Got your answer?I'm guessing you probably couldn't come up with one because a feeling of fear and indigestion likely overwhelmed you. And who could blame you? If I had the image below stuck in my memory from just seven years ago I'd be leery about using the ""set it and forget it"" mantra to invest in the financial sector as well. data by  . 10-year performance for Bank of America, Citigroup, AIG, and MBIA. Gray area represents Great Recession.The financial sector has certainly witnessed its fair share of ups and downs. It's a predominantly cyclical sector, meaning financials stocks tend to do really well when the U.S. or global economy is growing, and have a hard time boosting profits when the U.S. economy or global economy is shrinking. Because growth cycles are just a normal part of economics, holding a cyclical stock for extremely long periods of time may not be preferable.But financial sector stocks also offer a number of benefits. There isn't a sector in the stock market that'll offer investors more dividend-paying stocks than the financial sector. Dividends are often the cornerstone of any well-rounded retirement portfolio, as they can give an investor the opportunity to supercharge their returns by reinvesting those dividends back into the same stock. Not to mention regular dividends are generally a sign of a business positioned to survive over the long-term.Source:  user Ervins Strauhmanis.Fundamentally the financial sector is also attractive to all types of investors, appealing to value, income, and growth seekers (depending on the stock). Based on the latest data from Thomson Reuters, the forward P/E of  -based financial sector stocks was a mere 14.1, the second-lowest in the index, behind only telecommunication services at 14 even. Comparatively, most sectors trade at a forward P/E of between 17 and 20. The implication is there's more possible long-term upside to financial sector stocks relative to other sectors.To be clear, there probably isn't a financial stock that's going to be entirely unaffected by an economic downturn, so if you're looking for this sort of unicorn you won't find it in this sector. However, the risk-versus-reward ratio can be greatly in investors' favor if they're willing to put in a little research.With that in mind, let's take a closer look at three financial sector stocks you could confidently consider buying right now and holding over the next 25 years.The first financial stock that I believe long-term investors can buy and not touch for a very long time is MasterCard.To be fair, MasterCard does have some challenges to deal with, including decreased spending activity during global recessions and the threat that alternate payments platforms (ahem,  Pay) could one day bypass it as the payment processing middleman.But these concerns aside, I believe the  .Source:  user Scott Lewis.To begin with, investors have to remember that MasterCard is purely a payment processing facilitator and not a lender. This means if economic growth turns negative and loan delinquencies rise, it and its peer  have absolutely no liability for those delinquent loans. This is a smart way for an investor to de-risk themselves from sharp economic downturns that occur once or twice a decade.Another important point is that MasterCard's growth potential is seemingly uncapped for at least the next decade, if not beyond. According to its CFO, 85% of global transactions are still being conducted in cash. This represents a sizable expansion opportunity for MasterCard, which still has a relatively small but growing presence in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.Lastly, MasterCard's business model is well-protected since the barrier to entry in payment processing is high. Aside from a few major players, it's virtually impossible for any company short of an Apple to enter the payment processing space and forge the number of merchant connections that MasterCard or its peer Visa have developed over decades.All told, MasterCard has a big opportunity to increase its dividend over time and is already a free cash flow machine. It's a company I'd suggest you can feel comfortable holding for 25 years.Next on the list we have payroll processing company Paychex.As I noted above, these companies aren't without their own unique risks. For payroll processor Paychex, it suffers when the unemployment rate rises (fewer employees mean fewer paychecks processed), and it delivers lower investment income when the Federal Reserve drops the federal funds target rate in an effort to boost lending and the overall economy.Yet, like MasterCard, Paychex has a bright future that shouldn't worry long-term investors much at all.Source: Paychex, Facebook.For starters, Paychex is the perfect play on a growing U.S. economy and an increasing population. Even with baby boomers dropping out of the workforce, the sheer number of younger adults that will take their place over the coming decades, compounded with forecasted economic growth across nearly all sectors, should propel Paychex's top- and bottom-lines higher.Another key point is that lending rates are currently near historic lows and probably only have room to move higher. This is important because businesses front Paychex money to pay their employees, usually a few days in advance of actually cutting those checks. This short but constant holding period allows Paychex to  like CDs, which are interest-rate sensitive -- and it gets to keep the interest earned! Thus, even if interest rates normalize over the next couple of decades Paychex should see a marked improvement in its investment income. Tack this onto Paychex's 3.1% yield which, when reinvested, could deliver a 115% return over 25 years without a single payout increase, and you'll see why I'm so confident in Paychex.Lastly, I'd suggest long-term investors give consideration to one of the most ""boring"" sectors of the market -- insurance -- and dig deeper into why Allstate could literally put their portfolio in good hands over the next 25 years.The biggest risk that Allstate, and really any insurer, faces is the unknown catastrophe that's invariably right around the corner. Insurance, by nature, is there to protect people from unexpected losses, be it property, casualty, of even life insurance for a person's family or loved ones. If a large catastrophe hits, or a series of catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes hitting the east coast of the U.S. and damaging homes), it could cause insurers to pay out more than they're bringing in with premiums and newly underwritten policies. Additionally, weak economic environments that necessitate low interest rates to drive turnaround can hurt Allstate, which benefits from rising interest rates.These worries are well known, but there's plenty of reason to be bullish on Allstate over the long-term as well.Source: Allstate, Facebook.The biggest advantage for insurers  . Insurers can raise premium prices after a catastrophe and use the catastrophe as justification for nationwide increases. In other words, insurers rarely lose money for any extended period of time, because they can simply exercise their pricing power to rebuild their reserves. And insurers can also raise prices in environments where claims are relatively low, while using catastrophes as the justification once again. In this case they're merely front-running inevitable Acts of God.Similar to Paychex, insurers should also benefit as lending rates normalize over the long-term. Insurers pool their premium money into fixed-income investments like CDs and bonds, which tend to be interest-rate sensitive. Imagine how much investment income Allstate can generate once it's making 2.5%-3% on a CD instead of just 1% or less!Taking these factors into account, and Allstate's history of steady dividend growth, I'd suggest this is a company you can trust over the long run.

But  , and some early viewers are claiming it's destined to change everything from banking to health care. In fact, ABI Research predicts 485 million of this type of device will be sold per year.

 (  ) reported loss in second-quarter of fiscal 2015 for the third consecutive quarter. The company's adjusted loss per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization and other one-time expenses) from continuing operations of 19 cents widened nearly two-fold from the year-ago loss of 10 cents. However, the company's bottom line was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents.On a GAAP basis, Intuit's loss widened to 23 cents per share from 13 cents reported in the year-ago period mainly due to higher operating expenses which more than offset the top-line growth.Intuit's revenues grew 3.3% year over year to $808 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $784 million. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by higher customer addition and increased adoption of Intuit's cloud-based solutions.Services and Other revenues jumped 23.2% year over year to $610 million, while product revenues declined 31% from the year-ago quarter to $198 million.Segment-wise, Small Business Group recorded 1% year-over-year decline due to 10% drop in QuickBooks desktop ecosystem revenues as the company continues to focus on online solutions. However, QuickBooks Online subscribers surged 50% to 841,000.Nonetheless, management expects QuickBooks Online to add more subscribers to the QuickBooks segment despite the decline in desktop units.Now coming to the operational metrics, Intuit reported 7.1% year-over-year increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher spending on research & development (up 6.8% year over year), selling and marketing (up 7.5% year over year) and general & administrative expenses (up 8.3% year over year).Higher investments resulted in an adjusted operating loss (including share-based compensation but excluding amortization expenses) of $72 million which widened from a loss of $28 million reported in the year-ago period.Intuit's adjusted net loss from continuing operations (including share-based compensation but excluding amortization expenses) came in at $54.7 million as against a loss of $30.9 million in the year-ago quarter.The maker of tax-preparation software TurboTax exited the quarter with cash and investments of $1.37 billion. Long-term debt remained flat sequentially at $499 million. Further, Intuit generated cash flow of $247 million from operating activities in the first six months of fiscal 2015. During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $555 million and has $1.2 billion under its share buyback authorization.Apart from reiterating the fiscal 2015 guidance, Intuit provided the outlook for third and fourth quarters as well.The company expects revenues in the range of $2.075 to $2.150 billion for the third quarter. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.231 billion. Management expects non-GAAP operating income in the range of $1.17 to $1.19 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share within $2.70 to $2.75. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.77.For the fourth quarter, Intuit anticipates revenues in the range of $720 to $745 million, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $656 million. Management expects non-GAAP loss per share within 8 to 6 cents per share in the quarter.Further, the company has reiterated the fiscal 2015 outlook and expects revenues in the range of $4.275 to $4.375 billion, a decline of 5% to 3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.343 billion.Non-GAAP operating income is projected in the range of $1.11 to $1.14 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected between $2.45 and $2.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.94.Further, management expects QuickBooks Online subscribers in the range of 975,000 to 1 million at the end of fiscal 2015.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will continue to support the segment. The increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive factor. The company has also restructured its business to focus more on QuickBooks services. It expects to continue to invest in the QuickBooks portfolio. Thus, higher investments will impact the company's profitability in the near term.Moreover, we believe the rising competition from other payroll solution providers such as Paychex Inc. (  ) and Automatic Data Processing (  ) is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector worth considering is DST Systems Inc. (  ) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Feb 19. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 32.4%. However, it is worth noting that Intuit has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 192.5%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will continue to support the segment. The increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive factor. The company has also restructured its business to focus more on its QuickBooks services. It expects to continue to invest in the QuickBooks portfolio.Despite long-term benefit, these investments will negatively impact second-quarter profitability, in our view. Moreover, we believe that the rising competition from other payroll solution providers such as Paychex Inc. (  ) and Automatic Data Processing is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and current economic uncertainty.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Intuit will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. ESP for Intuit is -7.69%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss per share of 28 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 26 cents. Intuit's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies which, as our model shows, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Demandware, Inc.

W all Street will be eyeing Friday's jobs report closely. So willPaychex (  ), an IBD Dividend Leader and a direct beneficiary of an improving labor market.With a market capitalization just north of $10 billion, Paychex provides payroll, human resources, insurance and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-size businesses. It's a dominant player in the industry, along with its main competitor,Automatic Data Processing (  ).When it comes to earnings and dividend stability, it's hard to do much better than Paychex. In January, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share, payable on Feb. 17 to shareholders of record Feb. 2. An annualized dividend of $1.52 gives it a yield of around 3.2%.In December, Paychex reported fiscal second-quarter profit of 47 cents a share, up 9% from a year ago. Sales growth accelerated from the prior quarter, rising 10% to $676.3 million. Payroll service sales rose 4% to $411.2 million. Human resources services sales jumped 21% to $254.7 million.In the second quarter, the company unveiled Paychex Flex, which integrates a software-as-a-service platform with the company's newly expanded service offerings.Meanwhile, a new product related to health care reform is doing well. It offers clients assistance in understanding the Affordable Care Act and its impact on business.At the end of the second quarter, Paychex's cash and total corporate investments totaled $927.5 million. The company is debt-free.Despite steady price performance in recent months, Paychex has its share of detractors. Short interest has stayed relatively high in the stock for several months, perhaps because of fears that the job market isn't as strong as recent data indicate.

"o far in 2015, the market has been rather volatile, with triple-digit moves in the Dow the rule rather than the exception. And there is a strong possibility of a market correction in the not-too-distant future, since the major indices have pretty much gone straight up for six years now.Source: Flickr user With that in mind, there are some stocks you can invest in that we consider to be safe places to put your money no matter what the market does. We asked three of our analysts, and these are some of their favorites. In my opinion, one of the safest stocks to own -- and to buy right now -- is one that makes up my own biggest stock position:  , headed by none other than Warren Buffett. Why do I like it and what makes it seem so safe? Well, lots of things.For one thing, it's managed very conservatively by Buffett himself, whose first rule in investing is ""Don't lose money."" With the company's primary focus on insurance (it owns GEICO, for example) and his expertise in that subject, he's a great assessor of risk, taking only reasonable chances. His company is also broadly diversified, owning huge stakes in relatively stable stocks such as  ,  , and  . It also owns gobs of companies outright, many of them in industries that are likely to stick around for a long time, such as home buying, home building, jewelry, candy, paint, underwear, furniture, and ice cream. It even owns a railroad -- one that, in Buffett's words, ""carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline."" It's hard for such a big company to grow rapidly, but its revenue and earnings have still averaged double-digit annual growth rates.Then there's its valuation, which is actually not quite as compelling today as it has been in recent years and months. Its price-to-earnings, price-to-book, price-to-sales, and price-to-cash-flow ratios are all above its five-year averages -- but not by a lot. The stock has surged about 33% over the past year and has averaged about 18% annually over the past 30 years. Buffett himself has warned against expecting any rapid growth as the company has gotten so big. Still, if you're looking for a long-term holding, and one that will let you sleep better at night, this is a great portfolio candidate. It's hard to be against Warren Buffett. One stock that has benefited from the acceleration in the economic recovery recently is  . The human-resources specialist provides payroll and other HR services to its clients, with an emphasis on small and midsized businesses that have the most to gain from outsourcing many of the HR tasks that would otherwise be too distracting for a small-business owner to handle without outside help.Early in the recovery, jobs growth was tepid at best, with ordinary Americans largely being left out from gains in other economic areas. As we've seen in recent months, though, employment in the U.S. has climbed at a much faster pace. Moreover, not only has the economy created more jobs, but the January employment report also showed a greater number of workers participating in the labor force, partially offsetting what had been a disturbing trend toward less participation.Paychex has competition from other payroll and HR-services companies, but its midsized focus gives it the ability to extend its reach in both directions, going after larger employers while also catering to small up-and-coming businesses. As long as the employment picture looks sound and economic growth continues, Paychex should be a good way to benefit from a healthier job market. is a safe stock to own, even as both the stock and the market are trading at all-time highs. The stock rallied 34% over the past 12 months, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 14% gain.  all five of Disney's business segments reported positive operating YOY income growth, with four of them posting double-digit returns.Disney also trades at a reasonable 18 times forward earnings, which is comparable to  and  's respective forward P/Es of 17 and 16. Yet Disney has three things that Time Warner and Fox lack:  who maximizes franchise value, built-to-last film franchises, and evergreen theme parks.Under CEO Bob Iger, Disney acquired Pixar, Marvel, and LucasFilm -- which solidified its position as an entertainment powerhouse. Iger put Pixar's Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter in charge of Walt Disney Animation Studios, which pumped out new in-house animated hits like Frozen. He let Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige control the unified Marvel Cinematic Universe, creating the most cohesive live-action comic book universe to date.Disney maximized these franchises by connecting them to shows, like  and  , on ABC, and launching companion attractions at its theme parks. Disney still has plenty of catalysts ahead -- a new  trilogy is set to launch later this year, its new Shanghai Disney Resort will open in 2016, and its Marvel films are mapped out until 2019.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

 . (  ) reported second-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings from continuing operations of 70 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents and grew 7.7% year over year.Revenues increased 6.7% year over year to $2,661.3 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,678 million. The year-over-year growth was driven by strength in the human capital management business.Employer Services revenues increased 4.2% year over year to $2,169.90 million based on organic growth. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 3% in the quarter on a same store sales basis.PEO Services revenues rose 17.8% year over year to $625.8 million in the reported quarter.In the quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for the company grew 15% year over year. New business bookings represent annualized recurring revenues expected from new orders.Interest on funds held for clients grew 2% year over year to $91 million. The growth was primarily due to 7% year-over-year growth in average client funds balances to $19.8 billion offset by a 10 basis points (bps) drop in average interest yield to 1.8%.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 5.8% year over year to $2,179.4 million, attributable to higher selling, general & administrative expense (up 2% year over year), operating expenses (up 7.5% year over year) and systems development & programming costs (up 7.4% year over year).ADP exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,952.7 million compared with $3,618.1 million as on Jun 30, 2014. Long-term debt was $10.3 million versus $11.5 million on Jun 30.For fiscal 2015, ADP expects revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 8% on a year over year basis. Further, the company expects earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% from $2.58 per share in fiscal 2014. Earnings are also expected to benefit from a 2 cents gain in relation to the CDK spin-off.This represents 75 to 100 bps expansion in pre-tax margin from 18.4% in fiscal 2014. Worldwide new business bookings are expected to rise approximately by 10% over $1.4 billion sold in fiscal 2014, compared with the previous outlook of 8%.Employer Services revenues are expected to grow approximately 5% year over year, down from the guidance of 6% to 7% provided earlier. This represents a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 100 bps. The company expects pay per control to increase 2% to 3% in the year.PEO Services revenues are expected to increase 15% to 17%, an increase from the earlier projection of 13% to 15%. Pre-tax margin is expected to grow 100 bps year over year, up from the 50 bps guided in the prior quarter.In addition, the company expects interest on funds held for clients to increase $5 million to $15 million, or 1% to 4% driven by estimated growth in average client funds balances of 5% to 7% to $21.8 to $22.2 billion. However, the growth would be partially offset by a decline in average interest yield to 1.7%.Further, the total contribution from client funds extended investment strategy is estimated to grow $5 to $15 million.We believe that the Dealer Services spin-off will help the company focus more on its relatively fast growing human capital management business. ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, a volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc. (  ) and Equifax Inc. (  ) are the near-term headwinds.Currently, ADP has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock in this sector is Atento S.A. (  ), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Shutterstock photoBig-cap Paychex has three favorable factors going for it.First,Paychex (  ) stock is forming a base-on-base pattern. The consolidation is a flat pattern built on top of a cup with handle. It offers a potential buy point at 48.30.The stock broke past a 44.78 entry in the cup with handle in October, but volume was weak. Paychex rose about 7% and then began the next consolidation.Individual investors should watch to see if the stock can break out in strong volume. Without strong volume, indicating institutional buying, there's nothing to drive the stock price higher.Second, Paychex belongs to a strong industry group. Commercial Services-Outsourcing was No. 10 among 197 industry groups in Wednesday's IBD. Research shows that a strong group helps a stock advance.Third, Paychex has expanded its outsourcing services, pushing into new areas. They include: a cloud-based time and attendance service that Paychex tacked on via its June acquisition of Nettime Solutions; Paychex Time, a mobile time-punch application; and a health care product that helps clients comply with the complexities of ObamaCare.Last week, Paychex reported results for fiscal Q2, which ended in November. Earnings rose 9%, up from 7% and 5% gains in the previous two quarters. Revenue grew 10%, the best in at least 19 quarters. Both earnings and sales topped the Street's estimates.After-tax margin was 25.6%, near the high end of the usual range of 22.4% to 26.6%.At the  Dec. 19, CEO Martin Mucci said that Paychex's client retention level was 82%, an all-time high.Paychex has a three- and five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1, on a scale that runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).The firm pays a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share, which yields 3.2% on an annualized basis.

Anyone who has ever hired an employee knows what an administrative hassle it can be. Between complying with countless rules and regulations, getting the financial aspects taken care of, paying the appropriate taxes, and generally ensuring the well-being of a company's entire workforce, many business owners find it impossible to juggle various HR tasks and still have time to run their companies. To make things easier,  has a suite of cloud-based software products that can help employers with everything from recruiting and time management to budgeting and managing benefits -- and as the economy has shown increasing signs of strength, growth in the number of jobs available has pointed to even greater opportunities for the company. In its fourth-quarter financial report on Tuesday afternoon, Ultimate extended its long and impressive track record of providing investors with the growth they want to see. Let's take a look at what Ultimate Software's fourth quarter looked like and whether the company can keep expanding this year and into the future.Ultimate Software not only produced top-line revenue growth but also turned its expanding business into greater profits. Revenue for the fourth quarter rose 21% to $135.4 million, which was almost exactly what investors had expected to see from the HR-cloud company. Recurring revenues rose at an even faster 24% pace, and with that portion of Ultimate's business making up more than 80% of total revenue, opportunities to bring in new recurring revenue will remain essential. Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share topped analyst projections by almost a dime, representing growth of about 25% from the year-ago quarter.Source: Ultimate Software.The main question for Ultimate looking forward is whether rivals  and  will come out with cloud-based HR offerings that can catch up to what Ultimate already offers. With a big lead over its competition, though, Ultimate appears poised to keep delivering new advances in its software and services. If all goes well, that could lead to Ultimate poaching more customers from ADP and Paychex, confirming the wisdom of its strategic vision for 2015 and beyond.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets.

The company's quarterly earnings of 47 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and increased 9.3% from the year-ago quarter mainly driven by improved top-line performance.Paychex reported total revenue (including Interest on funds held for clients) of $676.3 million increased 10% from the year-ago period and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $674 million. Excluding interest on funds held for clients, total services revenue (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) also grew 10% from the year-ago quarter to $665.9 million.Payroll Service segment revenues went up 4% from the year-ago period to $411.2 million, primarily driven by higher revenue per check and client base.Human Resource Services segment revenues increased 21% year over year to $254.7 million mainly driven a new product offering within the company's professional employer organization. Apart from this, a strong growth in client base and worksite employees, increased revenues from retirement and online HR administration services aided to the segment's revenue growth.Interest on funds held for clients was up 4% on a year-over-year basis to $10.4 million primarily benefited from a rise of 4% in average investment balances owing to increase in client base and wage inflation.Paychex's total expenses increased 10% from the year-ago quarter to $406.1 million of which 6% is attributable to rise in compensation-related expenses and 4% due to costs associated with the company's new minimum premium plan health insurance offering within its professional employer organization. Total expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, increased 30 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 60%.Paychex reported operating income of $270.2 million, up 9% from the year-ago period, attributable to a higher revenue base. Operating margin decreased to 40% from 40.3% in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher operating expenses.Excluding interest on funds held for clients, Paychex's operating income came in at $259.8 million or 38.4% of total services revenue compared with $238.6 million or 38.7% of total services revenue in the year-ago period.Net income came in at $173 million or 47 cents, which improved from $158.7 million or 43 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Paychex exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $140.4 million compared with $152.5 million at the end of fiscal 2014. Corporate investments were $388.6 million versus $398.7 million at the end of fiscal 2014. The company has no long-term debt. The company generated operating cash flow of $404.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2015.During the first six months of fiscal 2015, Paychex repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $52.5 million and paid a dividend of $276.2 million.The company maintained its fiscal 2015 guidance provided in Jun 2014. Management expects 3-5% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago period. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 16-19%.Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 8-10%. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2015 are expected to remain flat, primarily affected by low interest rate. Net income for fiscal 2015 is expected in the range of 6-8%.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenues is expected in the range of 37% to 38% for fiscal 2015. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be same as the fiscal 2014 guidance (36-37%).Paychex reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. Moreover, both revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily boosted by growth across all its segments. The company reiterated its fiscal 2015 outlook, which signifies that it is relatively well-placed amid the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Moreover, we remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (  ) and Insperity (  ) remain the headwinds for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). A better-ranked stock in the outsourcing industry which investors may consider is Sykes Enterprises Inc. (  ), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Source: MetLife.I find MetLife's stock quite appealing for a lot of reasons, beginning with the prospect of rising interest rates. Remember that insurers take in a lot of money in premiums, which they invest in relatively safe places (think, for example, bonds) while waiting to pay out claims. The company is already performing well, though, topping analyst expectations for operating earnings in its last quarterly report. It's targeting additional growth in the promising and not-saturated market of Asia, and is embracing e-commerce, with a mobile interface for customers. The company has spent nearly a billion dollars buying back its own stock, and has just authorized another billion for the same purpose.MetLife's stock recently yielded 2.5%, and its payout ratio is quite low, near 29%, suggesting plenty of room for further growth. The company's forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is well below its five-year average of 11.4, too, suggesting an attractive price. Here's one thing to keep an eye on, though: The company was recently voted as ""systemically important"" by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which means it might be subject to additional oversight and may have to make some changes, such as selling some assets. MetLife doesn't want to be considered too big to fail, though, and may appeal the decision.: With the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus in the rearview mirror and U.S. GDP roaring higher by 5% in the third quarter I'm squarely looking at payroll processor  as a prime beneficiary for two particular reasons.Source:  user John Lambert Pearson.For starters, the end of QE would imply to Wall Street and consumers that the U.S. economy is capable of standing on its own two feet. Some investors may have been sad to see the Fed's ""free money"" go away, but it's an important step for the U.S. economy to have its ""training wheels"" taken off. The adjusted 5% GDP growth in Q3 along with a falling unemployment rate suggests that hiring is improving - a good sign for payroll companies like Paychex which will net higher fees from covering more employees.The other factor to consider here is that the end of QE should result in a steady rise in short-term lending rates beginning in 2015. While higher interest rates would instantly benefit banks and insurers, its an oft-overlooked point that payroll companies have a lag time between when they collect payments from employers and issues checks to employees. This float time will allow Paychex to net more substantial profits assuming lending rates rise.Considering that Paychex is already divvying out a 3.3% yield I suspect it's a company that could really turn heads in 2015. 2015 is shaping up to be another great year for stocks. But if you want to make sure that 2015 is  best investing year ever, you need to know where to start.

n Dec 12, Zacks  upgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The current optimism surrounding the stock can be attributed, to some extent, to the company's recently (Dec 1) announced special cash dividend of $2 per share to be paid on Dec 26 to shareholders of record as of Dec 15. This disbursement comes in addition to the quarterly dividend payment of 19 cents per share announced on Nov 14. Such rewards are likely to boost investors' confidence in the stock.We believe that the company's sound financial position motivates it to undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Insperity ended the third quarter of 2014 with cash and marketable securities of $225.4 million versus $212.3 million in the prior quarter. Moreover, the company did not carry any long-term debt.Further, Insperity posted better-than-expected third-quarter results on Nov 3. The company recorded earnings per share of 33 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Revenues grew 3.8% year over year to $560.3 million. The year-over-year improvement was attributed to higher average paid worksite employees (up 1.8%) and higher revenues per worksite employee (up 2%).Over the last 60 days, all five estimates for the current fiscal moved up, raising the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.9% to $1.10. Also, 3 out of 5 estimates for fiscal 2015 were raised, translating into 2.3% rise in the Zacks Consensus Estimate to $1.31 over the same period of time.Insperity provides human resources as well as business solutions to small and medium-sized businesses to help them perform better. We believe management's initiatives to expand the number of Business Performance Advisors and implement a healthcare reform strategy will be beneficial over the long run. Moreover, the company's software-as-a-service and other adjacent business services are gaining traction, which are expected to improve the 2014 results.A debt-free balance sheet, share repurchases and dividend payouts are other positives, but rising expenses and competition from Automatic Data Processing Inc. (  ) and Paychex Inc. (  ) remain headwinds.Currently, Insperity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors can also consider Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. (  ) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is worth buying.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

"Shutterstock photoMaybe the race wasn't to the swift during biblical times, but in the 21st century you'll get left behind in a hurry if you're slow out of the gate with new technologies.Rivals ofUltimate Software Group (  ) are finding that out.Ultimate makes workforce management software designed to help clients better manage employee-related services such as payroll, benefits, recruiting, performance management and time management.The core product is UltiPro, software that manages the employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Ultimate delivers it via the Internet cloud.That last part -- the cloud -- is what separates Ultimate from others in its industry, analysts say. Ultimate was an early mover in designing an integrated, cloud-based human resources/payroll system, giving it a leg up on rivals who have taken longer to leverage the cloud.""As the move to the cloud has accelerated, Ultimate has been one of the biggest beneficiaries,"" said Samad Samana, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""They are taking a lot of customers away fromADP (  ), Ceridian andPaychex (  ).""Cloud-based systems have several advantages over hardware-based systems, Samana told IBD.""There is a lower overall cost of ownership because you don't have to purchase hardware,"" he said. ""There's less staff cost in terms of management. And there are more frequent updates to the software, which helps you keep up with the pace of innovation.""Ultimate's ability to trot out new products and innovations has been one of the keys to its consistent financial growth through the years. The company posts double-digit sales and earnings gains with regularity and is expected to keep doing so well into the future.""The market for Ultimate's solutions is large and growing rapidly. The company has strong, highly regarded products, increasing scale, and a business model that better balances revenue growth and profitability than many SaaS (software as a service) peers,"" MKM Partners analyst Kevin Buttigieg noted in a report last month initiating coverage on Ultimate with a ""buy"" rating.Ultimate boasts 2,700 customers with employees in 150 countries. Its client list features a diverse range of firms, including software makerAdobe Systems (  ), restaurant operatorsBloomin' Brands (  ) andTexas Roadhouse (TXRH), auto parts retailerPep Boys (PBY) and Major League Baseball.Ultimate mainly focuses on two types of customers: enterprise companies, defined as those with more than 1,500 employees, and mid-market companies, or those with around 500 to 1,500 employees.Ultimate's enterprise sales team, which consists of 75 sales reps, has ""an unusually low turnover"" rate with an average tenure of 10 years, Barrington Research analyst Jeff Houston noted following Ultimate's third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 28.He cites several reasons for the low turnover, including ""not penalizing successful salespeople by narrowing their territories as well as world-class benefits.""During a conference call with analysts, Ultimate CEO Scott Scherr noted a number of enterprise wins during the company's third quarter, though he didn't divulge the names of the customers. These included a ""high-profile"" restaurant chain with 18,000 employees, a security company with 6,500 employees and an education services company with 3,600 employees.While most of Ultimate's business comes from large and mid-sized clients, the company has lately increased its efforts to land more smaller companies of 500 or fewer employees, analyst Houston says.""Management was clear that it has been selling to companies with fewer than 500 employees for a long time, and that it is just adding more salespeople to target the low end of the market,"" he noted.FBR's Samana reckons it will be some time before the move to land more smaller clients begins to have much impact on Ultimate's financial results.""The move downstream is a newer initiative for them, so it's something where we will see a bigger contribution a couple of years from now,"" he said. ""It's not as big a driver in the near term.""Although analyst Houston says Ultimate stands to benefit as the economy adds jobs, CEO Scherr mentioned on the third-quarter conference call that with new customers being Ultimate Software's biggest growth driver, changes in employment ""are not that material"" to the overall growth goal.During the third quarter the company logged revenue of $127.4 million, up 24% from the prior year and just ahead of consensus analyst views. Earnings gained 25% to 50 cents a share, topping estimates by a penny.Recurring revenue, or revenue that is likely to continue in the future, increased 26% during the quarter.""The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our cloud offering,"" Scherr said in a statement.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ultimate to post full-year 2014 earnings of $2.02 a share, up 26% from a year earlier. EPS is seen rising another 22% to $2.46 in 2015.The company's stock price touched a nearly eight-month high of 156.20 on Tuesday. Shares are up 20% since Oct. 10.Ultimate is part of IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, which ranks fifth in the group. Three stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 99:Manhattan Associates (MANH),Paycom Software (PAYC) andSynchronoss Technologies (SNCR).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Ultimate Software Rides Cloud To Lead Workforce Niche@2014-11-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ultimate-software-rides-cloud-lead-workforce-niche-2014-11-18
uman resource and business solutions provider  (  ) recently announced a special cash dividend of $2 per share to be paid on Dec 26 to shareholders of record as of Dec 15. This disbursement comes in addition to the quarterly dividend payment of 19 cents per share announced on Nov 14. Such rewards will surely boost investors' confidence in the stock.This is not the first time Insperity has paid such special dividends -- the last time was in Dec 2012 when it paid $1 a share.The special dividend was primarily supported by continued solid operational performance. Insperity delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 15.5%.The company also increased its quarterly dividend six times since the inception of the program in 2005. The program is also expected to return nearly $90 million to Insperity investors in 2014. The decision to return value as well as a portion of capital is based on Insperity's strong liquidity position and positive free cash flow generation capabilities.This apart, the board had approved a 1.9 million share repurchase program, which includes approximately 693k shares authorized in Sep 2014. These efforts not only retain investor confidence but also attract potential investors.Now let's have a look at how Insperity performed in the third quarter of 2014. Cash and marketable securities were $225.4 million versus $212.3 million in the prior quarter. Insperity did not carry any long-term debt balance. We believe that with a sound dividend policy and strong cash position, Insperity will continue rewarding its shareholders in the quarters ahead.Insperity recorded earnings per share of 33 cents, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Revenues grew 3.8% year over year to $560.3 million. The year-over-year improvement was attributed to higher average paid worksite employees (up 1.8%) and higher revenues per worksite employee (up 2%).Given a debt-free balance sheet, we think the move makes sense. We are also positive on Insperity's recurring revenue model, higher worksite employees, and software-as-a-service business model.However, competition from Automatic Data Processing Inc. (  ), Paychex Inc. (  ) and ManpowerGroup Inc. (  ) remains a headwind. Moreover, the company provided a tepid full-year guidance, which will remain an overhang on the stock.Currently, Insperity has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ayroll and human resource solutions provider  (  ) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Dec 19. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.2%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Paychex reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. Moreover, both revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily boosted by growth across all segments. The company provided modest outlook for fiscal 2015, signifying that it is relatively well-placed amid the current macroeconomic sluggishness.We remain encouraged by Paychex's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide it with additional opportunities. Also, increases in checks per client and better average revenue per check will boost its business, going forward.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (  ) and Insperity remain the possible headwinds.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 46 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise predictions difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:FedEx Corporation (  ) with an Earnings ESP of +4.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Accenture plc (  ) with an Earnings ESP of +0.84% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) is set to report the first-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Nov 20. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 200.0%. Moreover, it is worth noting that Intuit has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 198.07%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Although Intuit reported a loss in the last reported quarter (fourth-quarter 2014), revenues increased year over year primarily due to higher customer additions and increased adoption of Intuit's cloud-based solutions. Moreover, the company registered growth across all its business segments.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will continue to support the segment. The higher adoption rate of its cloud-based services and products is another positive. Also, the company's share buyback program is expected to aid the bottom line.However, we feel the rising competition from other payroll solution providers such as Paychex Inc. (  ) and Automatic Data Processing is a reason for, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Intuit will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. ESP for Intuit is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss per share of 34 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

"everal securities litigation firms, including The Wagner Firm, Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC and Wolf Popper LLP have filed a class action lawsuit against  (  ) and some of its officers. The lawsuit concerns possible claims on behalf of the shareholders of Barrett pertaining to the probable infringement of federal securities laws.The lawsuit will represent a class consisting of the buyers of Barrett securities between Feb 12, 2013 and Oct 29, 2014 (the class period).The investigation pertains to some specific statements made by the company concerning its financial results. The law firms will probe into the matter to ascertain if the company intentionally misled investors about the financial situation, operational performance and business prospects of the company.The firms allege that Barrett breached the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as during the class period, the company failed to divulge that it had accrued its self-insured workers' compensation reserves, which resulted in an overstatement of the company's earnings.Moreover, the complaint claims that the company's internal and financial controls were inadequate and its statements were materially false and misleading at all pertinent times.On Sep 16, an analyst published a report, accusing Barrett of understating reserves and claiming that the company ""may be required to recognize a material charge to substantially increase its loss reserves."" Reacting to the report, Barrett's stock price tumbled over 15% later that day.The concerns of the analyst were validated when Barrett reported a substantial third-quarter net loss, driven by a substantial increase in workers' compensation reserves. This contradicted Barrett's prior representation that its workers' compensation reserves were ""reasonable and objective"" based on its operational history.Per the complaint which followed the company's third-quarter 2014 earnings on Oct 28, an $80 million pre-tax increase in workers' compensation reserves in effect obliterated the company's pre-tax earnings for the past five years, and drove its third-quarter net loss of $37.8 million. On this news, Barrett's stock plummeted nearly 59% on unusually heavy volume, to close at $18.28 per share on Oct 29, 2014.Barrett kept investors in the dark as it concealed material information, and their investments consequently witnessed heavy losses. This class action lawsuit seeks to recoup damages against the company on behalf of the defrauded investors.Barrett presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the outsourcing industry include Convergys Corp. (  ), Paychex, Inc. (  ) and Vistaprint N.V. (  ), each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

 data by Granted, ADP hasn't always been as generous with its dividend increases. During the financial crisis, ADP made only minimal dividend increases, preserving capital as it went through a tough time in its core business. Yet even at that point, ADP didn't give up on making big boosts, and with quarterly payouts having almost quadrupled in just the past decade alone, dividend investors can count on sustained growth in the quarterly payments they receive on their ADP shares.Automatic Data Processing provides outsourcing services to its clients, with a particular emphasis on payroll. As a result, ADP often does best when the economy has the most positive momentum, as a strong economy encourages more hiring and puts more businesses in a position in which they can afford to look outside their own walls to get help managing administrative functions like payroll.Over the past five years since the financial crisis, ADP has seen impressive earnings growth, and positive employment numbers have a lot to do with those improved results. As you can see below, the 2008 recession really hit ADP's earnings hard, and the sluggish recovery that followed initially limited the company's ability to bounce back. data by But gradually, unemployment levels have started falling back down toward more normal levels. In particular, positive conditions in key areas of the U.S. economy, such as the energy industry, have driven labor-market strength in certain areas of the country. More broadly, a generally favorable view toward the overall economy has improved business confidence and encouraged employers to consider hiring new people and tapping ADP for more of its services.Obviously, ADP will face business cycles in the future. But one sign of the strength of its dividend is that ADP has weathered short-term storms before without losing its dividend-paying resolve, and that doesn't appear likely to change anytime soon.One of ADP's biggest strengths is that it targets some of the largest companies in the world to provide its services. In general, ADP has focused its efforts on big employers, and while it hasn't completely ignored mid-sized and small businesses, rivals and have suites of services that target smaller-sized employers more directly.Source: ADP.One of ADP's biggest strengths is that it targets some of the largest companies in the world to provide its services. In general, ADP has focused its efforts on big employers, and while it hasn't completely ignored mid-sized and small businesses, rivals  and  have suites of services that target smaller-sized employers more directly.Having large-company exposure makes ADP more stable during good times, but it also threatens to make it less nimble when opportunities to tap into broader employer markets arise. Moreover, as  , ADP will repeatedly have to demonstrate that it's the best option for businesses of all sizes.Automatic Data Processing isn't the best-known company in the U.S., but it's among the best  investors could choose. With a history of strong business growth as well as a solid commitment to returning capital to shareholders, ADP should continue to be a top dividend stock well into the future. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby.

The year-over-year growth was driven by strong results from Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services segments.Employer Services revenues increased 7% year over year to $2.1 billion based on organic growth. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 3.1% in the quarter on a same-store-sales basis.PEO Services revenues rose 18% year over year to $594.9 million in the reported quarter.In the quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for Employer Services and PEO Services grew 11% year over year. New business bookings represent annualized recurring revenues expected from new orders.Interest on funds held for clients grew 1.2% year over year to $90.3 million. The growth was primarily due to 7% year-over-year growth in average client funds balances to $18.7 billion offset by a 10 basis points (bps) drop in average interest yield to 1.9%.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 8.1% year over year to $2.14 billion, attributable to selling, general & administrative expense (up 7.5% year over year), higher operating expenses (up 8.2% year over year) and systems development & programming costs (up 10.1% year over year).ADP exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents were $4.4 billion compared with $3.6 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $10.9 million versus $11.5 million in the previous quarter.On Sep 30, 2014, ADP completed the spinoff of its Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company known as CDK Global, Inc. The transaction is expected to provide ADP at least $700.0 million, which it plans to use for buying back shares.ADP expects fiscal 2015 revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. Further, the company expects diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% from diluted earnings per share of $2.58 in fiscal 2014. This represents 5 to 100 bps expansion in pre-tax margin from 18.4% in fiscal 2014. Worldwide new business bookings are expected to rise approximately 8% over $1.4 billion sold in fiscal 2014.Employer Services revenues are expected to grow approximately 6% to 7% with a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 100 bps. The company expects pays per control will increase 2% to 3% in the year.PEO Services revenues are expected be 13% to 15%. Pre-tax margin is expected to grow 50 bps on a year-over-year basis.In addition, the company expects interest on funds held for clients to increase $5 to $15 million, or 1% to 4% driven by estimated growth in average client funds balances of 5% to 7% to $21.8 to $22.2 billion. However, the growth would be partially offset by decline in average interest yield to 1.7% to 1.8%.Further, the total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is estimated to grow $5 to $15 million.Going forward, the company expects tax rate of 34.6% in fiscal 2015 compared with 33.9% in fiscal 2014.ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc. (  ) and Equifax Inc. (  ) are the near-term headwinds.Currently, ADP has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A better-ranked stock in this sector is TriNet Group, Inc.

usiness services provider  (  ) reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2015 results as revenues and adjusted earnings improved year over year due to the successful implementation of major pricing and marketing changes. GAAP net income for the reported quarter improved to $23.7 million from $0.4 million in the year-earlier quarter, primarily due to currency translation effects. On a per share basis, earnings for first-quarter fiscal 2015 surged phenomenally to 71 cents from 1 cent in the year-ago quarter.Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were 75 cents per share - way above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents.Total revenue in first-quarter fiscal 2015 surged 21% year over year to $333.9 million. The year-over-year increase in revenues was primarily attributable to tailwinds in leading markets due to changes in pricing and marketing practices along with healthy inorganic growth. Geographically, revenues were up 46% in Europe to $138.4 million, up 14% in Asia Pacific to $17.8 million and up 8% in North America to $177.7 million.Vistaprint is shifting its value proposition away from deep discounts and free-offer direct marketing efforts to tap the large market opportunity beyond the traditional base of highly price-sensitive customers. Quarterly revenues also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $333 million.Gross margin in the reported quarter fell to 61.0% from 65.2% in the year-ago period. The year-over-year reduction in gross margin was driven by the recent acquisitions of People & Print Group and Pixartprinting, which have different business models with relatively lower gross margin than Vistaprint-branded business.Operating income more than doubled to $16.9 million from $8.4 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year increase in operating income was largely on the back of higher revenues due to better customer service, improved product substrate quality, more reliable shipping methods, assistance for graphic design creation, new options for premium finishes and more stock keeping unit (SKU) choices. Management remains confident of healthy returns in the long run as it hopes to retain customer loyalty with focused services that translate into renewed organic growth.The company exited the quarter with $60.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and long-term debt of $433.5 million. At quarter end, the company had $268.1 million of borrowing capacity available under its credit facility.The company generated $52.6 million of cash from operating activities during the reported quarter compared to $0.1 million of cash utilization in first-quarter fiscal 2014. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32.3 million, while capital expenditures aggregated $16.7 million.For fiscal 2015, the company provided an unchanged operational outlook. However, the company revised its revenue guidance to better reflect the currency movements and GAAP EPS guidance to manifest a few non-operational impacts. Vistaprint is focused on leveraging its investments for a strategic repositioning of its brand and expects modest revenue growth during the transitional phase in fiscal 2015. The company also expects to benefit from the recent acquisitions, expansion in new geographic areas and customer additions. At the same time, Vistaprint expects to further improve on its margins through a continued focus on improving its productivity and efficiency levels. Although we expect the company to face short-term headwinds, it is likely to deliver solid results in the future on the back of these initiatives.Revenues for fiscal 2015 are currently expected in the range of $1,430 million to $1,500 million, slightly down from the earlier range of $1,470 million to $1,540 million. Fiscal 2015 GAAP earnings are presently anticipated within $2.24-$2.74 per share, up from $2.15-$2.65 per share, while adjusted earnings guidance is maintained in the range of $3.46-$3.96 per share. Capital expenditures are likely to range within $80 million and $100 million.Vistaprint currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shutterstock photoIf there's one word to describe Paychex, it's stability.Paychex 's (  ) three-year earnings stability factor is 1 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). The stock price has also been stable -- slipping 2% this year but rising 6% over the past 12 months. And the company has raised its quarterly dividend steadily since 2000, though it was unchanged through the Great Recession.Rochester, New York-based Paychex provides payroll, human resources, retirement and insurance services to small and midsize companies. It's benefitted from modest but steady job growth amid improvement in the overall economy.Profit and sales have risen at a mostly single-digit pace for 17 straight quarters. Profit for this year is expected to rise 8% to $1.85 a share in fiscal 2015, which ends next May, followed by a 9% gain in fiscal 2016.The company last boosted its quarterly dividend in July, a hike of 3 cents, or 9%, to 38 cents a share. The annual payout of $1.52 a share yields 3.5% at the current share price, easily topping the S&P 500 average of 2.02%.Meanwhile, Paychex is approaching a 44.78 buy point of a cup-with-handle base after getting support at its 50-day moving average.Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C and up/down volume ratio of 0.9 indicate a lack of conviction on the part of institutional investors. However, the well-regarded BNY Mellon Mid Cap Multi-Strategy Fund boosted its holdings of Paychex last quarter. It's held the stock for eight straight quarters.Paychex is well positioned to keep the dividends coming. It carries no debt, and annual return on equity and pretax margin have been well above the 17% threshold that investors should look for.On Oct. 15, the company reiterated its quarterly payout of 38 cents per share.

The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 0.83% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, a volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc. (  ) and Equifax Inc. (  ) are the near-term headwinds.The launch of ADP marketplace will help employers to manage an ecosystem of complementary enterprise applications, enabling them to extend the value of their workforce data across their entire organizations. The new product improves ADP's competitive position, in our view.We believe that the spin-off of its dealer services segment renamed as CDK Global will enable both ADP to focus on their core operation. Further, the company is expected to fetch a tax-free sum of $825 million on account of the spin-off which it will use for making share repurchases. This, in turn, will boost the bottom line growth going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ADP will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 60 cents. Hence, the difference is of 0.00%. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Still, the provider of payroll services offers stable earnings growth and a 3.4% dividend yield.Teco, which supplies electricity in Florida, is also still in buying range above an 18.63 buy point. Its initial breakout ended in failure, but it retook the buy point in strong volume on Oct. 20, four days after it was in the Income Investor column.

Among the largest underlying components of USMV, in trading today Becton, Dickinson and Co.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@USMV, BDX, PAYX, VZ: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2014-10-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/usmv-bdx-payx-vz-large-inflows-detected-etf-2014-10-27

On a year-over-year basis, reported earnings per share increased 5.8%.Paychex reported total revenue (including Interest on funds held for clients) of $666.8 million for the quarter, which not only increased 8.8% from the year-ago period but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $659 million.Excluding interest on funds held for clients, which was up 2% on a year-over-year basis, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) increased 8.9% from the year-ago quarter to $656.6 million. Interest on funds held for clients was up attributable to lower average interest rates earned, which partially offset an increase of 3% in average investment balances.Payroll Service segment revenues increased 4.5% from the year-ago period to $412.8 million, primarily driven by higher checks per payroll, revenue per check and client base.Buoyed by growth in client base in retirement services, HR Solutions and eServices products, Paychex's Human Resource Services segment generated revenues of $243.8 million, which increased 17.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, PEO (professional employer organization) showed strong growth during the quarter, which helped the year-over-year increase in revenues.Paychex's total expenses increased 11.5% from the year-ago quarter to $399.3 million, primarily due to compensation-related expenses. Moreover, higher expenses related to investments in product development and supporting technology and higher sales-related costs were also responsible for the rise in expenses. Moreover, total expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 149 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Paychex reported operating income of $267.5 million, up 4.9% from the year-ago period, attributable to a higher revenue base. Operating margin decreased to 40.1% compared with 41.6% in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher operating expenses.Excluding interest on funds held for clients, Paychex's operating income came in at $257.3 million or 39.2% of total services revenue compared to $245.1 million or 40.6% of total services revenue reported in the year-ago period.Net income came in at $171.3 million or 47 cents, which improved from $162.8 million or 44 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Paychex exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $462.6 million versus $152.5 million at the end of the previous quarter. Corporate investments were $96.7 million compared with $398.7 million in the previous quarter. Paychex has no long-term debt.During the first quarter, Paychex repurchased 0.9 million shares for approximately $37.5 million. During the quarter, the company paid a dividend of $138.3 million. The company generated operating cash flow of $263.1 million during the quarter.For fiscal 2015, management expects 3%-5% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago period. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 16% to 19%.Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 8%-10%. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2015 are expected to be flat, primarily affected by low interest rate. Net income for fiscal 2015 is expected to be in the range of 6-8%.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenues is expected to be in the range of 37% to 38% for fiscal 2015. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be constant with the fiscal 2014 guidance (in the range of 36%-37%).Paychex reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. Moreover, both revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily boosted by growth across all segments. Paychex provided a modest outlook for fiscal 2015, which signifies that it is relatively well-placed amid the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Moreover, we remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (  ) and Insperity (  ) remain the possible headwinds for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors can also consider Micron Technology Inc. (  ), which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" (  ) recently provided an updated guidance for fiscal 2015 considering the spin-off its dealer services segment, CDK Global. The two companies will be separated through a distribution of CDK Global shares after the market closes on Sep 30, 2014.ADP shareholders of record as of Sep 24 will receive one share of CDK Global common stock for every three shares of ADP common stock held. Once the spin-off gets completed, ADP will be reporting the operational results of the Dealer Services segment under ""discontinued operations"".Accordingly, the company forecasts its earnings per share from continuing operations to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2015, up from 11-13% as per the prior guidance. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 73 cents, up 10.6% from the year ago quarter.This newly forecasted figure is inclusive of 2 cents benefit that the company expects from the incremental share repurchase. The share repurchase program will be funded from the tax free $825 million that ADP expects to receive on account of the CDK Global spin-off. This share repurchase program is expected to be completed by Jun 30, 2015.ADP reiterated its revenue guidance for fiscal 2015, which is expected to rise 7% to 8% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.05 billion, up 8.5% on a year-over-year basis.We believe that the spin-off will enable both ADP as well as CDK Global to focus on their core operations. ADP will remain focused on enhancing its position as a leading global provider of HCM solutions, while CDK Global will focus on providing leading global technology solutions to help dealers and manufacturers perform better over the long term.ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, a volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc. (  ) and Equifax Inc. (  ) are the near-term headwinds.However, the Dealer Services spin-off will remain an overhang on the stock in the near term. Although the plan is shareholder friendly, it did not go down well with credit rating agencies.Following the announcement, Standard & Poor's lowered ADP's credit rating from AAA to AA, primarily due to the company's plan of using the proceeds to buy back shares. Moody's (  ) Investor service also decreased its rating to Aa1, citing lower scale and variety of ADP's product portfolio.Currently, ADP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Only two of those quarters were in the teens on a year-over-year basis.In the current report, analysts expect 46 cents a share, a 5% increase from a year ago, a consensus estimate unchanged in the past 60 days. In the last three quarterly reports, Paychex has beaten the consensus by a penny or two.In the most recent report, earnings per share grew 5% with revenue up 9%.The company provides payroll services to 580,000 small and midsize companies. It also offers human resources outsourcing, retirement and insurance.The company was founded in 1971 and became a phenomenal growth story during the 1990s. The stock has been moving sideways since 2000. It's been moving in a tight fashion since the end of last year, perhaps building a base.Earnings dropped in 2009 and 2010, but have recovered every year since. The five-year annualized EPS growth rate is 4% and the five-year Earnings Stability Factor is an impressive 3 on a 0 to 99 scale where low numbers correspond to steady earnings growth.With no debt, the return on equity is also impressive at 35% for 2013, more than double the 17% benchmark investors should seek.Pretax margins the same year were 39%.On July 10, the company announced it was increasing its dividend from 35 cents to 38 cents a share. The dividend was paid out Aug. 24. The current dividend works out to an annual yield of 3.6%.The quarterly dividend was just 9 cents in 2000 and has been growing steadily, although it was held at 31 cents for more than three years during the Great Recession.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Can Paychex Keep Rolling Out Growth?@2014-09-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-paychex-keep-rolling-out-growth-2014-09-23

" (  ) recently announced that its board has set Sep 30, as the date for the spin-off of its Dealer Services business segment, which was recently renamed ""CDK Global"". The spinoff proposal was first made in Apr 2014.The two companies will be separated through a distribution of CDK Global shares after the market close on Sep 30, 2014. ADP shareholders of record till Sep 24, will receive one share of CDK Global common stock for every three shares of ADP common stock held.Per ADP, the new company will start trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange with the ticker name ""CDKVV"", on its issuance on Sep 22, 2014.The name of the new company was derived from the three of the businesses' core operations namely, Cobalt Digital Marketing, the core Dealer Services and global technology business Kerridge Computer Co.Automatic Data Processing expects to receive at least a sum of $700 million tax-free from the spinoff, which it expects to use fully in making share repurchases.We believe that the spinoff will enable both ADP as well as CDK Global to focus on their core operations. ADP will remain focused on enhancing its position as a leading global provider of HCM solutions, while CDK Global will focus on providing leading global technology solutions to help dealers and manufacturers perform better over the long term.ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention.

hares of  (  ) have generated a return of 9.6% over the last 3 months.Equifax is a leading information services provider to consumers and businesses. The recent price appreciation can be attributed to the company's offerings, which help customers to understand, manage and protect their clients' information and take informed financial decisions. We believe that a solid product portfolio and experience within the sector will keep Equifax ahead of its peers.Equifax also serves a wide range of industries, such as financial, mortgage, consumer, commercial, telecommunications, retail, human resources and automotive. This diversified client base is extremely beneficial as weakness in any sector can be balanced with strength in the others.Recently, to increase shareholder value, Equifax has authorized a new share buyback plan of $400 million. Equifax added that the new buyback plan will be in addition to the $141.7 million remaining under its present plan. The repurchase initiative strengthens Equifax's commitment to increase value for its shareholders. Per company records, Equifax has returned $2.4 billion through share buybacks and dividends over the last 10-year period.Additionally, the company has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. In Jan 2014, Equifax acquired TDX Group, a U.K.-based debt-management firm, for $327.0 million. We believe that the acquisition will enable Equifax to provide a broad insight into consumer performance, financial status, capabilities of customers and market opportunities. Moreover, it will further solidify Equifax's presence in the U.K., which in turn will boost its revenues.It is also worth noting that Equifax delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.1% in the last reported quarter on revenue that was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Broad-based strength across segments helped revenues grow from the year-ago quarter.Equifax's strong growth prospects have boosted investor sentiment as well.Management's optimism is reflected in the EPS guidance of 96-99 cents and top-line guidance of $620-625 million for third-quarter 2014. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $623 million and 99 cents, respectively. Moreover, Equifax is expected to generate revenues of about $2.44-2.47 billion and EPS of $3.83-3.91 in 2014. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.455 billion and $3.88 per share, respectively. The yearly guidance is higher than previously estimated revenues of $2.43-2.48 billion and EPS of $3.75-3.89.Management's efforts such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America were the encouraging points in the quarter.Given the company's strong correlation to consumer and financial markets as well as its U.S. and European exposure, we expect a gradual improvement in results. Moreover, the improving mortgage environment could be a positive for the stock. However, stiff competition from Automatic Data Processing Inc (  ), Paychex, Inc. (  ) and Moody's Corp. (  ) and uncertainty in the mortgage sector are concerns.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ayroll and human resource solutions provider,  (  ) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Sep 24. Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. It is worth noting that Paychex has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.2%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Paychex reported modest fourth-quarter results, with the top line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line matching the same. However, both revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily boosted by growth across all its segments. Moreover, Paychex provided an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2015, which signifies that it is relatively well-placed amid the current macroeconomic sluggishness.We remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with additional opportunities. Also, increases in checks per client and better average revenue per check will favorably impact its business, going forward.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from Automatic Data Processing (  ) and Insperity remain the possible headwinds for the company.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 46 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Micron Technology (  ) Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Neogen Corp.

 (  ) stands to lose out on 15-16% of its revenues post the spin-off of its Dealer Services segment in October 2014. Investors have been concerned about how the company intends to recover the loss of revenue and continue to grow in the future. ADP recently announced that it intends to increase focus on its cloud-based and Affordable Care Act oriented products in order to drive growth in revenues once the Dealer Services segment is spun off. This is the first step ADP has taken in order to demonstrate enhanced focus on its Human Capital Management (HCM) business. It corroborates ADP's reasoning behind the Dealer Services spin off, that it would allow the company to increase focus on its payroll and human resource business.In April 2014, ADP decided to spin off its Dealer Services segment into an independent publicly-traded company. ADP will rake in $700 million from the spin-off, which will be utilized to repurchase its own shares. The deal cost ADP $15 million in the fourth quarter. Additional spin-related expenses of approximately $40-$50 million will be recorded in discontinued operations in fiscal 2015.ADP intends to grow its cloud-based solutions through increased penetrations of its integrated strategic platforms - RUN, Workforce Now and Vantage. These platforms offer a wide range of services such as payroll, benefits, human resource management, tax compliance, and time and attendance, integrated into one packaged solution and are targeted at various businesses according to their sizes. The RUN platform serves small businesses; Workforce Now caters to mid size businesses; and Vantage is for large enterprises with more than 1000 employees.Cloud-based solutions are gaining eminence in the payroll and HR services industry due to the convenience of using such products. Clients can access these services from any remote location through an internet enabled device. It also does away with the need to hire a professional to handle HR related activities, thereby reducing costs and removing human error. Since clients find cloud-based products more convenient to use, they will be attracted to such products. Therefore an increase in such offerings bodes well for ADP. Given the number of ADP's payroll clients and the revenue generated by the segment in fiscal year 2014, we calculated that the addition of one client to ADP's payroll service will increase revenue by approximately $12,500.Increasing cloud-based solutions will also be advantageous for ADP on the competitive front since other players, such as Paychex (  ) and Intuit (  ), already have significant presence in Cloud-based human capital management solutions market.By increasing its cloud-based solutions, ADP will not only benefit from an increase in clients but also from reduction in costs, which will lead to improved margins. Cloud-based solutions eliminate the need to hire professionals at ADP's end to help clients manage their payroll and HR responsibilities. As more and more clients shift to these online services, labor costs for ADP will decrease and help in improving margins. Also, since the service is online, scaling up the service will be easier and would not require intensive capital expenditures.ADP has been actively migrating clients from its stand alone payroll services to its integrated platforms. During 2014, ADP migrated 90,000 clients to its RUN platform and expects the remaining small business clients to migrate to RUN by fiscal year 2015. It migrated 7,000 clients to its Workforce Now platform, driving the total up to 50,000 users, compared to 40,000 a year ago. Also in 2014, ADP managed to double the sales of its Vantage solution. These efforts have led to a 45% increase in ADP's clients for its cloud-based solutions.Apart from focusing on cloud-based solutions for its integrated platforms, ADP is looking forward to products that are intended for clients looking to maintain compliance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Though ADP introduced such products in 2013, their adoption has been slow due to the lack of awareness and uncertainty of the timeline for implementation. The complexities behind adherence to the ACA and the delay in implementation dates have kept potential clients at bay.A survey conducted by ADP revealed that only around half of the small, midsized and large businesses in the U.S. are aware of the impact of the ACA and are prepared for them. This leaves a huge market of potential clients who are looking for solutions that will help maintain compliance with the ACA provisions. ADP is well positioned to cater to these clients given its existing presence in the Payroll and Human Resources outsourcing industry and readily available services designed for the ACA.

"Shutterstock photoMore than a million new business establishments formed in the U.S. last year, according to federal government data, and history suggests that roughly half will likely go under within five years.If you make your money serving small businesses, this can't be a very heartening figure.On the other hand, if you flip the equation upside down, you realize that a pretty good percentage of businesses will make a go of it beyond five years.Executives atTriNet Group (  ) figure there's plenty of money to be made in this market. The company provides human resources services to small and midsize businesses in the U.S and Canada.It does payroll processing, handles aspects of employment law compliance and offers employee benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans and workers' compensation insurance.TriNet delivers its services via a cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform. Its customers come from a diverse mix of end markets including technology, life sciences, property management, professional services, banking and financial services, retail, manufacturing and hospitality.Most of these customers lack the staff and resources to weave through complex human resources and employee benefit regulations.Rather than do the work themselves, they outsource it to TriNet and peers such asAutomatic Data Processing (  ),Paychex (  ) andInsperity (  ).TriNet operates under a professional employer organization (  ) model in which clients enter into a shared employment relationship. TriNet is the employer of record for work site employees, or WSEs, while clients retain day-to-day control and direction of the WSEs.According to industry data cited by Timothy McHugh, an analyst at William Blair & Co., the PEO sector grew at a compound annual rate of about 10% from 1995 to 2013, the last year data are available.""We believe that this growth is occurring because PEOs provide a strong value proposition for small businesses, which are facing increasing regulation, a growing number of potential point-solution providers, and upward pressure on insurance rates as a result of the Affordable Care Act,"" he said in a report initiating coverage on TriNet.He said TriNet's ""vertically oriented salesforce, multiproduct approach and transparent and flexible pricing"" are unique in the field.""In our view, TriNet's technology ranks at the high end of the PEO sector and there are solid benefits to scale in this business,"" he added.It's hard to argue with TriNet's sales results. The 26-year-old firm, which had its  in March, has run off nine straight quarters of double-digit-percentage revenue growth. Bottom-line performance has been choppier.On Aug. 4, the company reported second-quarter revenue of $525 million, up 44% from the previous year. Adjusted earnings came in at 24 cents a share, topping consensus estimates.TriNet officials declined to comment for this story. On a Q2 conference call with analysts, CEO Burton Goldfield said TriNet has been adding clients who previously tried ""to stitch together their HR function through insurance brokers, software and limited internal capabilities, what we term an unbundled solution.""About 75% of TriNet's new clients in the second quarter had not previously used a bundled solution, he said. That was about the same percentage as the first quarter.""We witnessed a very strong performance across each of our bundled product offerings in the second quarter,"" Goldfield said. ""We saw healthy trends across multiple business segments and multiple geographies, with particular strength in California, New York, Massachusetts and Florida.""One product that did well during the quarter was Ambrose, which TriNet acquired in July 2013.Ambrose helps hedge funds, private equity firms and other financial companies handle tasks such as payroll preparation, tax reporting and health plan management. As part of the service, TriNet provides a dedicated HR associate for personal support to all client employees.""We saw several high-profile clients sign on to the Ambrose product due to our high-end ACA compliant health benefit plans,"" Goldfield said. ""Our Ambrose product is also benefiting from strong word-of-mouth. ...Frankly, being a public company has helped in this sector as well.""TriNet had around 259,000 WSEs at the end of the second quarter, a gain of 31% from the previous year. That figure included approximately 13,000 WSEs acquired from Ambrose. Organic growth was 23%.""Notably, both revenue and WSE growth came in ahead of peers ADP and (Insperity),"" JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang noted in a report on TriNet's Q2 results.Huang reckons TriNet will benefit from several different growth drivers in coming quarters, including increasing demand for bundled HR services. That market is only 4% penetrated, he says.He also expects TriNet to benefit from an increase in health care regulation, which should convince more small and midsize businesses to outsource.Meanwhile, TriNet's ""vertically oriented sales force"" should drive market share gains, Huang said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect TriNet to post full-year earnings per share of $1.09 in 2014 and $1.35 in 2015.The company's stock debuted at an IPO price of 16 in March. It rose as high as 29.96 on Aug. 13 and currently trades near 28.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@TriNet HR Services Boom As Red Tape Swamps Businesses@2014-08-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trinet-hr-services-boom-red-tape-swamps-businesses-2014-08-25

 (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Aug 21. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.3%. Moreover, it is worth noting that Intuit has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with a negative earnings surprise average of 153.6%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intuit reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2014 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same. However, year-over-year comparisons were favorable due to a strong tax season and robust customer additions.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will continue to support the segment. The higher adoption rate of its cloud-based services and products is another positive factor. Also, the company's share buyback program would aid the bottom line.Recently, Intuit completed the acquisition of Check Inc., a mobile bill payment start-up. Check will be integrated into Intuit's Consumer Ecosystem Group. We believe that the acquisition will help Intuit to provide value added services to its customers, thereby increasing its customer base going forward.Nevertheless, competition from other payroll solution providers such as Paychex Inc. (  ) and Automatic Data Processing, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concern us.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Intuit will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 5 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Intuit's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

"hen an investor like Warren Buffett amasses a fortune of tens of billions of dollars in large part due to his stock market savvy, or a mutual fund manager like Peter Lynch doubles the market average for over a decade, it's easy to imagine that they are close to infallible when it comes to stock-picking. After all, to be that successful, an investor has to be correct the vast majority of the time, right?Nope. While they likely make good calls more often than bad calls, the truth is that even great investors lose money on a lot of their stock picks. When you are dealing with a financial machine that has as many moving parts as the stock market, expecting to be right on 100% of your picks (or 90%, 80% or even 70% of your picks) just isn't realistic.It's also not necessary -- and, in fact, it can be quite dangerous.One of the gurus I follow who stressed this point is Martin Zweig. During the 15 years it was monitored, Zweig's stock-picking newsletter was ranked number one according to risk-adjusted returns by Hulbert Financial Digest, averaging gains of 15.9% per year. But Zweig wasn't perfect. He didn't try to be.Zweig chose stocks using what he termed a ""shotgun"" method, which involves screening thousands of stocks against specific quantitative investment criteria to find those that make the grade. This was in contrast to what he called the ""rifle"" method, which involves analyzing a small number of stocks very thoroughly, looking not only at fundamentals but also at non-quantitative aspects.When you're screening through thousands of stocks, you're going to end up buying some that turn out to be busts, and Zweig found that his approach had a built-in error rate of about three-eighths over the long term. ""That is, out of eight stocks that I pick, three, or 38%, will underperform the market,"" he wrote in his book, Winning On Wall Street. Of course, it would be great if you knew ahead of time which stocks fell into that 38%. But no one can do that -- and Zweig showed that you don't have to. Beating the market 62% of the time netted him huge profits.Other great investors (Buffett comes to mind) use something of a rifle approach -- and they make plenty of mistakes, too. In fact, Buffett often discusses his mistakes quite candidly in his annual letters.But Zweig said the shotgun approach is probably more suitable for most people. I agree. Most investors don't have the time to perform in-depth research on numerous different companies. Plus, a shotgun approach helps keep dangerous emotion out of your decisions, since you're sticking to the numbers -- a stock's financials and fundamentals.Zweig isn't the only guru I follow who used a shotgun method. Top hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt does, too. His strategy targets stocks that are often beaten down but have strong fundamentals -- though they could have non-quantitative factors that are driving them lower. ""That's why you really have to buy a basket of 20 or 30, because I'm not sure anyone really knows the answer to each individual one of these companies,"" he once said. ""On average they'll do quite well over a period of time, but I wouldn't want to select one or two individual stocks from that group.""Both Zweig and Greenblatt thus knew no stock-picker is perfect -- they succeeded instead by tilting the odds of success, based on historical data, in their favor. That's what I do with my Guru Strategies, each of which is based on the approach of a different investment great, and my experiences with these shotgun-type methods have been in line with what Zweig and Greenblatt say. For example, since I started tracking it over 11 years ago, my 10-stock Zweig-inspired portfolio has averaged gains of about 9.7% per year, while the S&P 500 has gained just 6.1% per year. But the portfolio's accuracy (the%age of picks it makes money on) is 56.9% -- far from perfect.Similarly, my Greenblatt-based portfolio, which I started tracking in late 2005, has gained 10.3% per year vs. just 5.0% for the S&P 500, but it's been right on just over half (53.8%) of its picks.The bottom line is that you're going to make plenty of losing stock picks. If you try or expect to be perfect, you're much more likely to get rattled by those mistakes, making it more likely that your emotions will cause you to ditch a good strategy at just the wrong time.But while you can't be perfect, ""you can, however, be right more than you are wrong,"" Zweig wrote. ""If you are right 60% of the time, ride your profits, and rein in your losses, you'll find that when you're right you're very right, and when you're wrong you're only moderately wrong. In the long run, a 60% success rate translates into huge gains, a 50% rate into solid gains, and even a 40% rate can beat the market.""These are the types of stocks my Zweig- and Greenblatt-inspired models are high on right now. I know that not all of them will be winners, but by investing in a basket of such stocks I put the odds in my favor. This low-cost airline ($4.8B market cap) operates more than 250 daily flights to over 50 destinations within the U.S., Latin America, Caribbean and Canada. The Zweig-based strategy likes that its earnings growth is accelerating (52% last quarter, vs. 19% long term) and its sales growth is accelerating (23% last quarter vs. 18% the previous quarter), and that it has no long-term debt. This firm is a provider of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small to medium-sized businesses. Its earnings and sales growth rates have been accelerating, and it has no long-term debt. Cognizant is a provider of custom information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. The firm ($27 billion market cap) has grown sales at a 26% clip and earnings at a 22% pace over the long haul. LKQ ($8 billion market cap) provides replacement parts, components and systems needed to repair vehicles (cars and trucks). It has grown sales at a 25% clip and earnings at a 23% pace over the long haul, and both those figures accelerated last quarter. This $3 billion firm is a provider of private educational services in China. It has grown earnings at a 28% pace over the long haul and sales at a 30% clip, and has no debt. Ebix ($500 million cap) supplies software and e-commerce solutions to the insurance industry. It has a 13.9% earnings yield and 205% return on capital, excelling on both tests used by this model. This $1.5-billion-market-cap biotech has a strong 23.4% earnings yield and whopping 1,216% return on capital. This petroleum refiner ($27 billion market cap) has a 15.5% earnings yield and 74% return on capital. Based in Texas, this video game retailer ($4.6 billion market cap) has a 15.1% earnings yield and 86% return on capital. With an earnings yield of 14.5% and return on capital of 58%, this parent of Coinstar and Redbox makes the grade.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Be Imperfect When You Pick Stocks@2014-08-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/be-imperfect-when-you-pick-stocks-2014-08-14

 reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings from continuing operations of 63 cents per share, which was inline with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues increased 9.7% year over year to $3.07 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.03 billion. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong results from Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services segments.Employer Services revenues increased 8.3% year over year to $2.14 billion. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 2.9% in the quarter on a same-store-sales basis.PEO Services revenues rose 19.2% year over year to $584 million in the reported quarter. Dealer Services revenues increased 7.6% on a year-over-year basis to $499.4 million.In the quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for Employer Services and PEO Services grew 5% year over year. New business bookings represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from new orders.Interest on funds held for clients declined 5.4% year over year to $95.1 million. The decline was primarily due to a 20 basis points (bps) drop in average interest yield to 1.7%, which was offset to a certain extent by an increase of 7% in average client funds balances from $20.4 billion to $21.8 billion.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 8.4% year over year to $2.62 billion, attributable to higher operating expenses (up 9.7% year over year), selling, general & administrative expense (up 6.5% year over year) and systems development & programming costs (up 7.1% year over year).ADP reported pre-tax earnings of $449.3 million from continuing operations, up 24.5% from the year-ago quarter. Employer Services, PEO services and Dealer services pre-tax income increased 14%, 17% and 14%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in the reported quarter.Net income from continuing operations was $303.6 million or 63 cents per share compared with $266.7 million or 55 cents in the year-ago quarter.ADP exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents were $4.02 billion. Long-term debt was $11.5 million versus $12.1 million in the previous quarter.In April, ADP announced its plans to spin-off the Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company. ADP expects the spin-off to be completed in Oct 2014. The Dealer Services business segment provides marketing solutions to over 26,000 auto retailers, distributors and manufacturers.The 100% tax-free spin-off will help ADP focus more on its core Human Capital Management (HCM) business, going forward. Per management, the strong long-term growth prospect of the automotive market will provide significant growth opportunities to the Dealer Services business.The transaction is expected to provide ADP at least $700.0 million, which it plans to use in buying back shares. ADP expects to keep the current quarterly cash dividend of 48 cents per share constant for the time being. Post the spin-off, the company expects to eventually raise its dividend payout ratio to 55-66%.ADP expects fiscal 2015 revenues to grow in the range of 7% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. Earnings growth is projected to be 11% to 13%.Employer Services revenues are expected to grow approximately 6% to 7% with a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 100 bps. PEO Services revenues are expected be 13% to 15%). Pre-tax margin is expected to grow 50 bps on a year-over-year basis.Combined Employer Services and PEO Services new business bookings are forecasted to be approximately 8.0% for fiscal 2014.ADP expects Dealer Services revenues to increase 7% to 8% with a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 50 bps.ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc. (  ) and Equifax Inc. (  ) are the near-term headwinds.However, we believe that the Dealer-services spin-off will remain an overhang on the stock in the near term. Although the plan is shareholder friendly, it did not go down well with credit rating agencies.Following the announcement, the Standard & Poor's lowered ADP's credit rating from AAA to AA, primarily due to the company's plan of using the proceeds to buy back shares. Moody's' (  ) Investor service also decreased its rating to Aa1, citing lower scale and variety of ADP's product portfolio.Currently, ADP has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Revenues from Staffing Services were $38.6 million, up 9.2% from the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to an increase in new businesses.Barrett's gross profit came in at $29.9 million, up 25.8% year over year. The company's operating expenses increased 23.8% from the year-ago quarter to $18.6 million, primarily due to higher incentive pay and increases in payroll expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A).The company's operating income increased 29.3% from the year-ago quarter to $11.3 million.

aychex (  ) is set to announce the results of its fourth quarter fiscal year 2014 (fiscal year ends on May 31) on July 1, after market closes. In the third quarter, its revenue grew 7.3% to reach $636.5 million driven by strong performance across its Payroll and HR Outsourcing segments, which offset a decline in interest earned on funds held for clients. Paychex's net income increased 10.7% to reach $160.1 million.During the three months form Paychex's fourth quarter, March, April and May, the unemployment rate for the U.S. has remained well below 7.3%, the average for 2013. In March, the unemployment rate was 6.7% and in April and May it was 6.3%. Additionally, 191,000, 220,000 and 179,000 jobs were added in March, April and May respectively. Some of the decline in the unemployment rate came from workers dropping out of the labor force. We believe that Paychex will have benefited from the addition of jobs and improvement in the employment situation in the U.S. and this will reflect in its fourth quarter revenues. However, sequential decline in margins may impact its bottom line.Check per client indicates the average number of employees Paychex's Payroll service caters to for a client. A decrease in unemployment rate indicates that clients are hiring more employees. This in turn increases Paychex's checks per client. With increase in checks per client, the segment's revenue also increases.In the third quarter, Paychex's Payroll Processing division posted revenue growth of 5% driven by 1% increase in checks per client. Improving employment conditions in the U.S. have helped increase Paychex's check per client for 16 consecutive quarters. We believe that this trend will continue in the fourth quarter as well. Combined with price increases, this should lead to mid single digit growth in the segment's fourth quarter revenue.Operating margin is a ratio which measures the proportion of revenues left after accounting for operating expenses. It is an indicator of the company's operating efficiency and a higher ratio indicates higher efficiency. Paychex's annual operating margins have historically remained close to 38%.As per Paychex's management, the company's quarterly operating margin trends downwards through the year. This is also evident from the operating margin for each quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the operating margin was 41%. This declined to 39.7% in the second quarter and then 39.4% in the third quarter. We expect the trend to continue into the fourth quarter driven by various technology investments to expand their Software-as-a-Service portfolio and seasonal sales related expenses.The HR Outsourcing division has historically shown strong growth as a value-added service to the company's existing payroll processing clients. In the third quarter, HR service revenue grew 12.4% to $212.1 million due to an increase in its client base for online HR administration products, retirement services and HR solutions. Growth in average asset value of participant's funds, insurance premiums and number of health and benefits applicants also contributed to the segment's revenue. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see low teens growth in the segment driven by the declining unemployment rates.

aychex (  ) reported its fourth quarter earnings (fiscal year ends May 31) on July 1, posting 9% year-on-year growth in total revenues to reach $639 million. This includes the impact of change in Professional Employer Organization (  ) direct cost adjustment. Growth in client base at Paychex's Payroll and Human Resource Service divisions contributed to the revenue growth. Growth at these segments also drove an 8% increase in total revenue for the fiscal year 2014, which was partially offset by a decline in interest earned on funds held for clients. Net income and earnings per share grew 18% due to the impact of an increase in provision for tax in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year. For the full fiscal year, net income and earnings per share grew 10%.Paychex has introduced a change in its accounting for direct costs related to its PEO service. Earlier revenues from the PEO service were recorded net of these direct costs. However, from this quarter onwards, these direct costs will now be included in operating expenses. This change in accounting methodology for PEO direct costs does create an artificial increase in the company's reported revenue but has no impact on its operating income. Excluding the impact of change in accounting for PEO direct costs, the total revenue in the fourth quarter increased 5% year-on-year. Paychex's operating income, the difference between its revenue and operating expense, grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for fiscal year 2014.Paychex provided a guidance of 8-10% growth in total service revenues for the fiscal year 2015. This guidance includes the impact of classification of PEO direct costs as operating expenses.Paychex's Payroll services revenue grew 3% year-on year in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in its check per client, revenue per check and increased penetration of products. Check per payroll, which indicates the average number of employees Paychex's Payroll service caters to for a client, increased 1.1% driven by the healthy employment conditions in the U.S. In March, the unemployment rate was 6.7% and in April and May it was 6.3%. Revenue per check increased as a result of price increase which was partially offset by discounts.For the fiscal year 2014, Payroll services revenue grew 4%. Paychex's Payroll clients increased 2% to reach approximately 580,000. The company expects 3-5% growth in the segment's revenues for the fiscal year 2015 based on its estimates for growth in revenue per check and client base growth.Paychex's HR Services revenue grew 22% year-on-year in the fourth quarter as a result of change in classification of PEO direct costs. Excluding the impact of the PEO adjustment, the segment's revenue grew 10% during the quarter and 12% during the fiscal year, driven by an increase in its client base for its HR Solutions, retirement services and online HR administration products. Paychex HR Solutions clients grew 13% and client employees grew 14% during the fiscal year. Increase in retirement plans, higher insurance premiums and increase in the number of health and benefits applicants also contributed to the segment's revenue growth.Paychex's growing focus on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions contributed to strong growth in HR administration products. In October 2013, Paychex announced a new SaaS platform which integrated all of its payroll and HR services and provides a one-stop solution for its clients. The platform offers payroll, HR benefits, time and attendance, training and performance management services through a single interface backed by a centralized database. Paychex recently acquired nettime solutions in order to add an online based time and attendance solution to its product portfolio. (  ) These products should continue to bolster revenues and help improve margins.Paychex's operating margin declined 45 basis points year-on-year to reach 35.7% in the fourth quarter driven by various technology investments to expand their Software-as-a-Service portfolio. On a sequential basis, operating margin declined 3.7% on account of seasonal sales related expenses.For the fiscal year 2014, Paychex's operating margin increased 10 basis points. We expect to see an increase in margins in the coming years driven by the increased adoption of SaaS based products. However, due to the impact of change in classification of PEO direct costs, the operating margin is expected to remain within the range of 37-38%.

 (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2014 earnings of 40 cents per share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, on a year-over-year basis, reported earnings per share increased 18.3%.Paychex reported total revenue (including Interest on funds held for clients) of $639.0 million for the quarter, which not only increased 9.2% from the year-ago period but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $618.0 million.Excluding interest on funds held for clients, which was up 2.0% on a year-over-year basis, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) increased 9.3% from the year-ago quarter to $628.8 million. Interest on funds held for clients was up due to lower average interest rates earned, which partially offset an increase of 3.0% in average investment balances.Payroll Service segment revenues increased 3.1% from the year-ago period to $394.5 million, primarily driven by higher checks per payroll, revenue per check and client base. Checks per payroll increased 1.1% from the year-ago quarter. The company witnessed growth in revenue per check on the back of price increases and higher adoption of Paychex's products. Paychex had roughly 580K payroll clients as of May 31, 2014, up 2.0% on a year over year basis.Buoyed by growth in client base in retirement services, HR Solutions and eServices products, Paychex's Human Resource Services segment generated revenues of $234.3 million, which increased 21.6% from the year-ago quarter.Paychex's total expenses increased 9.9% from the year-ago quarter to $410.7 million, primarily due to compensation-related expenses. Moreover, higher expenses related to investment in product development and supporting technology and higher sales-related costs were also responsible for the rise in expenses. Moreover, total expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased 46 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Paychex reported operating income of $228.3 million, up 7.8% from the year-ago period, attributable to a higher revenue base. Operating margin decreased to 35.7% compared with 36.2% in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher operating expenses.Excluding interest on funds held for clients, Paychex's operating income came in at $218.1 million or 34.7% of total services revenue, which increased from $201.8 million or 35.1% of total services revenue reported in the year-ago period.Net income came in at $145.9 million or 40 cents, which improved from $123.5 million or 34 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Paychex exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $152.5 million versus $271.3 million at the end of the previous quarter. Corporate investments were $398.7 million compared with $314.4 million in the previous quarter. Paychex has no long-term debt.During the fourth quarter, Paychex repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $46.8 million. Year-to-date, the company generated operating cash flow of $880.9 million.For fiscal 2015, management expects 3-5% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago period. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 16.0% to 19.0%.Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 8-10%. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2015 are expected to be flat, primarily affected by low interest rate.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenues is expected to be in the range of 37.0% to 38.0% for fiscal 2015. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be constant with the fiscal 2014 guidance (in the range of 36-37%).Paychex reported modest fourth-quarter results, with the top line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line matching the same. However, both revenues and earnings increased on a year over year basis, primarily boosted by growth across all its segments. Moreover, Paychex provided an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2015, which signifies that it is relatively well-placed amid the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Moreover, we remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from  (  ) and  (  ) remain the possible headwinds for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As the calendar quarter draws to a close this holiday-shortened week, so does another earnings season.The most significant quarterly reports due this week come from alcoholic beverage company Constellation Brands () and payroll processor Paychex ().Analysts on average are looking for strong results from the former and for modest growth on the top and bottom lines from the latter.Below is a closer look at what analysts expect from these two reports and a few others, as well as a peek at the beginning of the new earnings season.The fiscal first-quarter forecast for this maker of Svedka Vodka, Corona beer and Robert Mondavi wines calls for earnings per share (EPS) to be up around 59 percent from the year-ago period to $0.93 in Wednesday morning's report. Sales are expected to more than double to $1.41 billion.Note that the consensus EPS estimate has ticked up by a penny in the past 60 days and that analysts underestimated Constellation Brands earnings in the previous three quarters. So far, the consensus forecast for the current quarter has EPS up about 15 percent and a more than 11 percent gain in revenue. That EPS estimate has slipped by a penny per share in the past 60 days.Analysts expect this Rochester, New York- based staffing and outsourcing company to say that it had earnings of $0.40 per share in its fiscal fourth quarter. That would be up from $0.38 per share in the same period of last year. And revenues are forecast to have risen from $585.30 million a year ago to $617.35 million for the three months that ended in May.For the full year, analysts are looking for EPS of $1.71 on revenue of $2.47 billion. That would be up from $1.60 per share and $2.33 billion in revenue in the previous year. Like the quarterly EPS estimate, the one for the full year has not changed in the past 60 days. The company is scheduled to share its results Tuesday after the markets close.Here are the consensus forecasts for a few others scheduled to share their results before the Independence Day break:Aluminum company Alcoa () has traditionally kicked off each new earnings season, though it is no longer a Dow Jones Industrial Average component. The company is scheduled to post its second-quarter results Tuesday, July 8.The consensus forecast for Alcoa calls for earnings of $0.12 per share and for its revenue to total $5.66 billion. That would compare to the second quarter of 2013, when the company posted a profit of $0.07 per share and revenue came to $5.85 billion.At the end of that week, Wells Fargo () steps into the earnings spotlight, the first of the big banks to share their second-quarter results. The San Francisco-based financial giant is expected to say that its earnings came to $1.01 per share. That would be up from a profit of $0.98 per share in the same period of last year. Wells Fargo also is expected to say revenues slipped less than three percent from a year ago to $20.81 billion in the quarter.More big banks are scheduled to share their second-quarter results in mid-July, as the new earnings season ramps up. So far analysts expect to see declines on the top and bottom lines from Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Expectations For The Week Of June 30: Season Draws To A Close@2014-06-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-expectations-week-june-30-season-draws-close-2014-06-30

ayroll and human resource solutions provider,  (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Jul 1. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.8%. It is also worth noting that Paychex has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with a positive earnings surprise average of 3.0%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Paychex reported better-than-expected third-quarter results primarily boosted by modest revenue growth and margin expansion. Paychex reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, primarily boosted by modest revenue growth and margin expansion. Moreover, increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check positively impacted Payroll's service revenues. Human Resource Services revenues were driven by client growth and price increases.We remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives such as joint ventures and acquisitions support its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with additional opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from  (  ) and Insperity remain the possible headwinds for the company.Our proven model does not conclusively show that salesforce will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 40 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paychex's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ) Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +2.13% and holds a Zacks Rank #3Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

acks  downgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on Jun 12, 2014. Also, the company witnessed downward estimate revisions over the past 60 days.Following a negative earnings surprise of 2.0% in the last quarter and a tepid current guidance, Barrett Business Services witnessed downward estimate revisions for the second quarter and fiscal 2014 over the past 60 days. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter declined from $1.01 to 93 cents per share while that for fiscal 2014 declined from $3.17 to $2.96 per share over the same timeframe.Shares of Barrett Business Services slumped 3.8% on Jun 11, which represented a one-year negative return of 22.2% and a negative year-to-date return of 49.5%.Barrett Business Services reported dismal first-quarter 2014 results on Apr 29 wherein its loss per share came in wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher effective payroll taxes and a higher share count. Although the company reported a year-over-year increase in revenues, this lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, Barrett Business Services has a growing product pipeline that could help it build a healthy client base in the future.Nonetheless, it's likely that the company's investments in operational infrastructure improvements will continue to impact margins in the near term.

"Earnings aren't the focus this week, with just two S&P 500 members -  (  ) and  (  ) - reporting results. The spotlight is on the economy, with investors trying to size up the Q2 rebound following a few disconcerting economic reads in recent days.The ugly Q1 GDP read got easily dismissed as backward-looking and reflective of one-off weather distortions, with investors' collective hopes pinned on a strong rebound in the current and following quarters. Recent data is forcing the market to reassess the growth outlook for the current period, with many realizing that the Q2 rebound may not be as strong as initially expected. Estimates for Q2 GDP growth have started coming down and the negative revisions trend could gain more momentum in the coming days if data continues to come on the soft side. Tuesday's ISM survey and Thursday's June jobs report will be key in that respect.The Q2 earnings season will take the spotlight following the July 4th weekend, with Alcoa (AA) reporting results on the 8th. The aluminum producer will be the first S&P 500 member with fiscal quarter ending in June to report results; hence their claim to kick-start each reporting cycle. But from our perspective, companies with fiscal quarters ending in May get counted as part of the tally. In terms of this (official) definition, we will have seen Q2 results from 20 S&P 500 members. Not to make light of Alcoa's bellwether status, at least in the Basic Materials sector, but a number of these early reporters with fiscal quarters ending in May like  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and others tell us a lot more about the state of corporate earnings.It has been a mixed picture thus far, but it's way too early to draw any conclusions at this stage. The chart below shows the number of S&P 500 members reporting results in the coming weeks. As you can see, we will have a decent enough sample size by the middle of the month to start making preliminary evaluations of this reporting season.Estimates for Q2 have come down, largely in-line with the negative revisions trend that has been in place for quite some time, with the current expected growth rate of +2.9% down from +5.5% at the start of the quarter. The chart below shows the Q2 estimates have evolved over the last three months.Despite the material negative revision, the +2.9% total earnings growth for the S&P 500 in Q2 is still more than double the growth pace we saw in Q1. The U.S. economy went through some unusual times in Q1, with GDP growth turning negative and corporate earnings growth barely remaining in the positive territory. The table below compares what is expected for Q2 with what was actually achieved in Q1.Three sectors - Utilities, Consumer Discretionary, and Construction - will have double-digit earnings growth rates, while four will see earnings decline from the same period last year. The decliners list includes Finance, the largest earnings contributor in the S&P 500 index accounting for almost one-fifth of the index's total earnings. Earnings for the sector were down last quarter and are expected to be no better this quarter either.Looking at the constituent industries in the Finance sector, it is obvious that the growth challenge is particularly notable for the large banks. With persistently low interest rates keeping net interest margins under pressure and the mortgage business well past its prime, these operators are finding it difficult to deal with weakness in both the corporate as well as capital markets businesses. The resumption in M&A activity is a net positive, but isn't enough by itself to move the needle for these huge entities.More important than the earnings growth rate for Q2, which will most likely be better than the currently expected +2.9% pace, is the outlook for the second half of the year and beyond. The consensus expectation is for a material growth ramp up in the second half of the year which then carries into next year.The chart below shows current earnings growth expectations for Q2 and beyond. This shows earnings growth for the S&P 500 accelerating to a +8.5% pace in the second half of the year from the first half's +2.1% pace.Corporate guidance, which has persistently been on the weak side in recent quarters, will determine whether those expectations will hold or will need to come down.For a detailed look at the earnings picture, please check out our weekly  .

ICBA represents 6,500 community banks operating in the U.S.The alliance therefore allows Insperity to offer its human resource, financial and pay roll-related services to a wider number of clients. Likewise, the community banks selecting Insperity's products and services will now be able to consolidate their administrative operations and focus on providing enhanced services to their customers instead.Insperity provides human resources as well as business solutions to small and medium businesses to help them perform better. We expect the current partnership with ICBA to improve the company's growth prospects.It is worth noting that in the last-reported quarter, Insperity's revenues increased 4.1% on a year-over-year basis. The improvement was attributed to higher average paid worksite employees (up 2.3%) and higher revenue per worksite employee (up 1.7%). The company reported average client retention of 87.0% during the quarter. Nonetheless, higher-than-expected expenses impacted the bottom line.We believe management's initiatives to expand the number of Business Performance Advisors and implement a healthcare reform strategy will be beneficial in the long run. Moreover, the company's software-as-a-service and other adjacent business services are gaining traction and are expected to help improve 2014 results.Although the company has a debt-free balance sheet, competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) remain the headwinds.

 (  ), a provider of TurboTax and business management software solutions, has reportedly inked a deal with mobile bill payment start-up, Check Inc., for a purchase consideration of $360.0 million.Increasing adoption of smartphones has paved the way for mobile commerce. This has led to the emergence of a number of start-ups looking to simplify the mobile payment process. Check Inc. is one such start-up, which already has 10 million registered members that use the app to pay their bills. The app is a free download on  's (  ) Android and  's (  ) iTunes stores with the company generating revenue through in-app ads.We believe that the acquisition will help Intuit to provide value added services to its customers, thereby increasing its customer base going forward.Following this acquisition, Intuit could encourage customers to download Check's program on their smartphones and pay their bills through it. Also, Intuit's customers will be able to gather bill details, track their transactions and make scheduled payments using Check's app.Intuit has closed a number of acquisitions of late with the intention of diversifying its offerings and expanding its markets. The strong cash balance ($2.63 billion) and robust operating cash flow ($1.53 billion in the third quarter of 2014) enable the company to go for strategic acquisitions.One of Intuit's recent acquisitions was Lettuce, an online inventory and order management app worth $30.0 million. Lettuce is a cloud-based platform that offers a wide range of inventory and order management solutions that help to solve related problems faster. With the acquisition of Lettuce, Intuit will be able to build a more comprehensive platform for entrepreneurs as Lettuce's capabilities will boost Intuit's own platform.We are positive about Intuit's growing small & medium business (SMB) exposure and believe that all its acquisitions in the space, including Demandforce, Prestwick Services, LLC and Docstoc will continue to provide support to the segment. However, competition from leading payroll solution provider  (  ) and H&R Block, Inc., seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy are concerns.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Nevertheless, earnings increased 18.8% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings include stock-based compensation but exclude amortization and other one-time expense.Intuit reported revenues of $2.39 billion which increased 14.2% on a year-over-year basis. Reported revenues also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 billion. The year-over-year increase was attributed to higher customer additions and higher adoption on Intuit's cloud-based solutions.Product revenues increased 15.2% year over year to $735.0 million, while Services and Other revenues increased 13.8% from the year-ago quarter to $1.65 billion.Segment-wise, Small Business Group posted 8.0% year-over-year growth due to higher adoption rate of Intuit's cloud-based solutions. Small Business Financial Solutions increased 4.0%, primarily driven by higher QuickBooks revenues (up 7% year over year). Revenues from Payments remained flat on a year-over-year basis.Intuit witnessed strong year-over-year subscriber growth in its QuickBooks Online (36%), QuickBooks Desktop (up 22%) and QuickBooks Enterprise (up 18%). The company reported 624K QuickBooks Online subscribers at quarter-end. The rapid adoption of the QuickBooks Online can also be gauged by the 130% surge in subscribers to 64K outside the U.S.Moreover, Small Business Management Solutions revenues grew 16% while revenues from Employee Management Solutions increased 13.0% year over year primarily due to customer growth in Online Payroll services. Subscriber growth for Demandforce was 44%, primarily boosted by the acquisition of CustomerLink.Intuit reported adjusted operating income (including share-based compensation but excluding amortization expenses) of $1.51 billion which increased 16.5% from the year-ago period. Margins improved 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 63.1%. During the same period of time, the company's total expenses increased 10.8% year over year.Intuit's adjusted net income from continuing operations (including share-based compensation but excluding amortization expenses) came in at $990.9 million or $3.42 per share compared with $874.4 million or $2.87 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Intuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of $2.63 billion versus $1.33 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt remained flat sequentially at $499.0 million.Intuit generated $1.53 billion in cash from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2014. During the period, Intuit repurchased shares worth $1.43 billion and paid $165 million as dividends.The company has also revised its fiscal 2014 outlook. For fiscal 2014, the company expects revenues in the range of $4.475 to $4.505 billion, an increase of 7% to 8% year over year, compared with its previous guidance of $4.440 to $4.525 billion, which represented 6.0% to 8.0% growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.499 billion.Non-GAAP operating income is now projected in the range of $1.58 to $1.60 billion, an increase of 7% to 9%, compared with its earlier guidance of $1.58-$1.61 billion, representing 7.0% to 10.0% growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected between $3.54 and $3.58, up 11% to 12% year over year versus earlier estimate of $3.52-$3.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.13.However, Intuit toned down the fourth-quarter revenue as well as earnings guidance. The company expects fourth-quarter revenues to range between $683 million and $713 million (previous guidance $710 to $720 million) while non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 6 to 8 cents (earlier guidance 11-13 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $713 million for revenues and a break-even for earnings.Intuit reported encouraging third-quarter results due to strong tax season and robust customer additions. However, the company provided a modest guidance. We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that the strategic acquisitions will continue to support the segment. The higher adoption rate of its cloud-based services and products is another positive factor. Moreover, the company's share buyback program would aid the bottom line.However, stiff competition from the other payroll solution providers such as  (  ) and  (  ), seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concern us.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Net income for the reported quarter dropped sharply to $1.4 million from $5.9 million in the year-earlier quarter. On a per share basis, earnings for third quarter fiscal 2014 plummeted to 4 cents from 17 cents in the year-ago quarter.Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings for the reported quarter halved to $8.3 million or 24 cents per share from $16.9 million or 48 cents per share in the prior-year period. The quarterly adjusted earnings were way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.Total revenue in third quarter fiscal 2014 decreased 1% year over year for the first time in over 14 years to $286.2 million. The year-over-year decline in revenues was primarily attributable to headwinds in the leading markets - the U.S., Germany and the U.K. - due to changes in pricing and marketing practices. Geographically, revenues were up 2% in North America to $166.1 million and down 4% and 3% in Europe and Most of the World, respectively, to $104.2 million and $15.9 million.Vistaprint is shifting its value proposition away from deep discounts and free-offer direct marketing efforts to tap the large market opportunity beyond the traditional base of highly price-sensitive customers. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $310 million.Gross margin in the reported quarter fell to 64.7% from 65.5% in the year-ago period. Operating income also decreased to $5.2 million from $9.7 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year decrease in margins was largely due to higher operating expenses for better customer service availability, improved product substrate quality, more reliable shipping methods, assistance for graphic design creation, new options for premium finishes, and more stock keeping unit (SKU) choices. Despite the current slump in quarterly results, management remains confident of healthy returns in the long run. The company hopes to retain customer loyalty as its focused services translate into renewed organic growth.During the reported quarter, Vistaprint inked a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held printing and graphic product producer People & Print Group B.V. for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to form a behemoth in its category with complementary product offerings, operating synergies through economies of scale and technological collaboration to serve a wide spectrum of customers across the globe.Subsequent to the end of the quarter, Vistaprint signed an agreement to acquire Italian design firm Pixartprinting Srl. The acquisition involves a base purchase price of about €127 million. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to revenues and operating cash flow for fiscal 2014. However, it will have a weakening effect on GAAP earnings per share (EPS) till fiscal 2015, owing to transaction costs and expected amortization of intangible assets connected to the acquisition. For non-GAAP EPS, the acquisition is expected to be neutral to earnings in fiscal 2014, but accretive to fiscal 2015 results.Vistaprint also reached an agreement with Namex Limited to divest its minority equity interest in the firm. The company expects to sell its 45% stake to the majority shareholder and recognize a loss of up to $14 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The decision was made as the carrying value of the investment exceeded the expected proceeds.The company exited the quarter with $46.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total debt was $202 million. The company had $301.4 million available under its credit facility.The company generated $3.1 million of cash from operations compared with $8.1 million in third quarter fiscal 2013. Capital expenditures for third quarter fiscal 2014 were $11.8 million.For fiscal 2014, the company updated its revenue and earnings guidance to better reflect the current market conditions and acquisitions. Revenues for the current fiscal are expected in the range of $1,250 million to $1,270 million, up from the earlier projection of $1,235 million to $1,265 million. Fiscal 2014 GAAP earnings are expected in the range of $1.00-$1.15 per share, down from $1.55-$1.80 expected earlier. Adjusted earnings for fiscal 2014 are currently expected in the range of $2.70-$2.85 per share, compared with the prior range of $2.68-$2.93 per share. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are expected within $70 million to $80 million, down from previous guidance range of $80 million to $90 million.Vistaprint is focused on leveraging its investments and expects meaningful earnings growth in fiscal 2014. The company expects its strategic initiatives to drive customer loyalty and lifetime value. Expansion in new geographic areas and customer additions will bear fruit in the long term. Although we expect the company to face short-term headwinds, it is likely to deliver solid results in future on the back of these initiatives.Vistaprint currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) reported third-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $1.06 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Revenues increased 6.8% year over year to $3.32 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.34 billion. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong results from Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services segments.Employer Services revenues increased 5.7% year over year to $2.35 billion. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 2.8% in the quarter on a same-store-sales basis.PEO Services revenues rose 15.1% year over year to $650.8 million in the reported quarter. Dealer Services revenues increased 6.8% on a year-over-year basis to $494.9 million.In the quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for Employer Services and PEO Services grew 14.0% year over year. New business bookings represent annualized recurring revenues anticipated from new orders.Interest on funds held for clients declined 10.6% year over year to $100.1 million. The decline was primarily due to a 30 basis points (bps) drop in average interest yield to 1.6%, which was offset to a certain extent by an increase of 9% in average client funds balances from $23.2 billion to $25.2 billion.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 6.7% year over year to $2.56 billion, attributable to higher operating expenses (up 8.2% year over year), selling, general & administrative expense (up 3.0% year over year) and systems development & programming costs (up 10.0% year over year).ADP reported pre-tax earnings of $769.8 million from continuing operations, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter. Employer Services, PEO services and Dealer services pretax income increased 8.0%, 11.0% and 16.0%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in the reported quarter.Net income from continuing operations was $510.4 million or $1.06 per share compared with $481.6 million or 99 cents in the year-ago quarter. This excludes one-time gain of $11.2 million, ADP earned from the divestment of a certain business unit during the quarter. Including this gain, the company reported net income of $521.6 million or $1.08 per share.ADP exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.69 billion compared with $1.29 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $12.1 million versus $12.6 million in the previous quarter.Recently, ADP announced its plans to spin-off the Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company. ADP expects the spin-off to be completed in Oct 2014. The Dealer Services business segment provides marketing solutions to over 26,000 auto retailers, distributors and manufacturers.The 100% tax-free spin-off will help ADP to focus more on its core Human Capital Management (HCM) business, going forward. Per management, the strong long-term growth prospect of the automotive market will provide significant growth opportunities to the Dealer Services business.The transaction is expected to provide ADP at least $700.0 million, which it plans to use in buying back shares. ADP expects to keep the current quarterly cash dividend of 48 cents per share constant for the time being. Post the spin-off, the company expects to eventually raise its dividend payout ratio to 55.0-66.0%.ADP expects fiscal 2014 revenues to grow 8.0% (prior outlook 7.0% to 8.0%) on a year-over-year basis. Earnings growth is projected to be 9.0% (prior outlook 8.0% to 10.0%).Employer Services revenues are expected to grow approximately 7% with a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 100 bps. PEO Services revenues are expected to improve 14.0% (prior outlook 12.0% to 13.0%). Pre-tax margin is expected to grow slightly on a year-over-year basis.Combined Employer Services and PEO Services new business bookings are forecasted to be approximately 8.0% for fiscal 2014.ADP expects Dealer Services revenues to increase 8.0% with a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 100 bps.We believe that the Dealer-services spin off will remain an overhang on the stock in the near term. Although the plan is shareholder-friendly, it did not go down well with credit rating agencies.Following the announcement, the Standard & Poor's lowered ADP's credit rating from AAA to AA, primarily due to the company's plan of using the proceeds to buy back shares.  's' (  ) Investor service also decreased its rating to Aa1, citing lower scale and variety of ADP's product portfolio.Nevertheless, ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company. However, volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from  (  ) and  (  ) are the near-term headwinds.Currently, ADP has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADP Misses on Q3 Earnings, Revs - Analyst Blog@2014-04-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adp-misses-on-q3-earnings-revs-analyst-blog-2014-04-30

 (  ) is set to report third quarter fiscal 2014 results on Apr 30. Last quarter, it posted a 1.30% positive surprise. We note that ADP has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.90%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.ADP is expected to perform better on the back of improved execution and higher client retention. Moreover, recovery in the job market will help the company.Moreover, the 100% tax-free spin-off of its Dealer Services business into an independent publicly traded company will help ADP to focus more on its core Human Capital Management (HCM) business, going forward. This spin-off will provide nearabout $700.0 million, which the company would use up in share buybacks. This aggressive share buyback will boost profitability going forward.However, volatile macroeconomic environment and increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are the near-term headwinds.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ADP is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. That is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.08 which coincides with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Hence, the difference is of 0.0%. ADP's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Will Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Miss Earnings? - Analyst Blog@2014-04-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-automatic-data-processing-adp-miss-earnings-analyst-blog-2014-04-29

"n the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST) has taken over the #279 spot from Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Fastenal Co. (Symbol: FAST), the market cap is now $15.09 billion, versus Paychex Inc (Symbol: PAYX) at $15.02 billion.Below is a chart of Fastenal Co. versus Paychex Inc plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (FAST plotted in blue; PAYX plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FAST vs. PAYX:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FAST and PAYX collectively make up 3.49% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (  ) which is higher by about 0.6% on the day Tuesday.At the closing bell, FAST is up about 1%, while PAYX is off about 0.1% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Fastenal Takes Over #279 Spot From Paychex@2014-04-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fastenal-takes-over-279-spot-paychex-2014-04-08
 (  ) reported first-quarter 2014 loss per share of 50 cents, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 49 cents. Loss also widened from the year-ago loss of 36 cents, primarily due to higher effective payroll taxes and higher share count.Barrett reported gross revenues of $727.4 million in the first-quarter of 2014, up 23.0% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $746.0 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily attributable to continuous increase in the company's co-employed client count as well as improvement in same-store sales.Professional employer service fees grew 23.6% year over year to $693.9 million, primarily driven by new client additions. Revenues from Staffing Services were $33.5 million, up 12.5% from the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to an increase in new businesses.Barrett's gross margin decreased 13 basis points on a year over year basis to 1.3% due to higher costs. The company's operating expenses increased 21.9% from the year-ago quarter to $14.9 million, primarily due to higher incentive pay and increases in payroll expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses remained relatively flat year over year and came in at 2.1%.Higher-than-expected operating expenses impacted the overall operating results. Operating loss came in at $5.6 million, wider than a loss of $3.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Barrett reported net loss of $3.6 million or 50 cents compared with $2.5 million or 36 cents in the year-ago quarter.Barrett exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $97.3 million compared with $113.3 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt balance (including current portion) was $5.2 million compared with $5.3 million in the previous quarter.For the second-quarter of 2014, Barrett expects gross revenue to increase 15.0% on a year over year basis and range between $780.0 million and $800.0 million, up from $675.0 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $837.0 million. Management expects second-quarter 2014 earnings per share to range between 93 cents to 98 cents, up from 80 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.01 per share.Barrett reported dismal first-quarter results and provided a tepid second quarter guidance. Loss per share widened from the year-ago quarter but revenues increased on a year over year basis. Revenues were positively impacted by solid client growth. Despite the continuing macro uncertainty, Barrett expects strong business pipeline and a healthy client base in the future. However, higher effective payroll taxes negatively impacted Barrett's bottom line in the current quarter.Nonetheless, we prefer to wait and see whether the company's continued investments in operational infrastructure improvements rationalize margins in the near term.

itigroup lost some of its credibility this week after the Federal Reserve did not approve the bank's capital plans during annual stress tests.The tests are designed to asses a bank's ability to continue lending if there was a severe economic downturn; and Citigroup was one of five banks which failed.The decision means the company will not be able to pay its investors through buybacks or high dividends, which took share prices down nearly six percent in after hours trading.In other news around the markets:The International Monetary Fund has agreed to provide Ukraine with aid totaling $27 billion over the next two years if the nation is willing to meet certain conditions.

Its offerings include comprehensive payroll services, including payroll processing, payroll tax administration and employee pay services.We remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. In our view, the company's expansionary initiatives through joint ventures and acquisitions should bode well for its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on SMBs looking for HR solutions could provide the company with opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and stiff competition from  (  ) and  (  ) remain the possible headwinds for the company.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paychex is likely to beat earnings estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stand at 42 cents. Thus, the ESP is 0.00%.

ADP expects the spin-off to be completed in the early part of the fourth quarter of 2014.The 100% tax-free spin-off will help ADP to focus more on its core Human Capital Management (HCM) business, going forward. Per management, the strong long-term growth prospect of automotive market will provide significant growth opportunities to the Dealer Services business.The transaction is expected to provide ADP at least $700.0 million, which it plans to use in buying back shares. ADP expects to keep the current quarterly cash dividend of 48 cents per share constant for the time being. Post the spin-off, the company expects to eventually raise its dividend payout ratio to 55.0-66.0%.Although the plan sounds shareholder-friendly, it did not go down well with credit rating agencies. The Standard & Poor's lowered ADP's credit rating from AAA to AA, primarily due to the company's plan of using the proceeds to buy back shares.  Investor service decreased its rating to Aa1, citing lower scale and variety of ADP's product portfolio.The Dealer Services business segment provides marketing solutions to over 26,000 auto retailers, distributors and manufacturers. In the first six months of fiscal 2014, Dealer Services reported revenues of $957.0 million, which increased 7.2% on a year-over-year basis.

BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Laurence Fink added his voice to the growing criticism of activist investors' tactics this week.

"Shutterstock photoNext week, the standoff between the West and Russia over the annexation of Crimea will likely continue to weigh on investors' minds. With both the US and Europe starting to ramp up pressure on Russia through economic sanctions, many wonder if the new restrictions will start to affect their economies.Key Earnings ReportsNext week investors will be waiting for several key earnings reports including Walgreen (NYSE:  ), Accenture plc. (NYSE:  ), GameStop (NYSE:  ), and BlackBerry (NASDAQ:  )WalgreenWalgreens is expected to report second quarter EPS of $0.93 on revenue of $19.57 billion, compared to last year's EPS of $0.96 on revenue of $18.65 billion.On March 5, JP Morgan gave Walgreen an Overweight rating, noting that the company's same store sales came in above expectations.""This morning, WAG reported February SSS which were above our expectations on an overall basis (pharmacy came in above our estimate and Retail Metrics consensus while front end matched our estimate and was above consensus). Total sales of $6.05B were slightly above our $6.03B estimate. The comparable script trend (adjusted for calendar shifts, cough/cold/flu and flu shot impacts) rebounded in February versus a somewhat weaker January. Front end SSS exceeded consensus despite traffic remaining in negative territory for the third straight month after two consecutive months of positive comps. In our view, the results were solid despite the impact of weather (which is expected to contribute to higher SG&A in the quarter), and we would expect a favorable stock reaction today.""On March 19, Morgan Stanley also gave Walgreens an Overweight rating and said management commentary will be key for the stock's performance.""When WAG reports earnings next week on 3/25, we expect results to come in below expectations as captured by our quarterly ests. (MS $0.86, cons $0.92), negatively impacted by weather and promotional activity/traffic, key focus will not be on the print but on mgmt comments regarding timing of closing step 2 of AB transaction, pace of synergies, and the idea of redomiciling/ tax inversion.""Deutsche Bank gave Walgreens a Buy rating with an $80.00 price target on March 5th, citing the company's impressive February sales report.""Walgreens reported its February sales results, the last month of its Fiscal Q2, with total sales of $6.05 billion for February and $19.61 billion for Q2. F2Q sales of $19.61 billion is ahead of the consensus estimate of $19.53 billion, which is approximately 1c to EPS. Front end comp sales growth of 2.0% despite a negative impact of 0.6% from cold weather, continues solid front end growth despite the current promotional environment. We are updating our F2Q revenue to $19.61 billion and our F2Q EPS estimate is $0.94, ahead of consensus for $0.93. We maintain our Buy rating on WAG shares and increase our price target to $80.""Accenture plc.Accenture is expected to report second quarter EPS of $1.04 on revenue of $7.21 billion, compared to last year's EPS of $1.00 on revenue of $7.06 billion.Merrill Lynch gave Accenture a neutral rating with an $85.00 price objective on March 13th.The analyst team at Merrill Lynch noted that emerging markets remained a near term risk for the company, but that the overall growth is likely to continue at a slow and steady pace.""In June 2013, an unexpected slowdown in Brazil caught Accenture and investors by surprise. Accenture continues to face challenges in Brazil. BofAML economists now forecast just 1.6% YoY real GDP growth in 2014 in Brazil. Russia's political issues are also well known. BofAML has lowered its real GDP forecast to 1.7% in 2014 for Russia. In 4Q13, IBM's Services division saw mixed trends in its growth markets, particularly China. Recent declines in exports (down 2% YoY in Jan/Feb) have heightened China growth concerns.""S&P Capital IQ gave Accenture a Buy rating with an $88.00 price target on March 15th. The analysts at S&P see the company as well positioned in the industry over the long term.""We look for revenue growth of 3.5% in FY 14 (Aug.), given some weakness in the first half of the fiscal year. We look for improved performance in the third and fourth quarters, reflecting the strong bookings ACN has posted recently. We point to the $4.3 billion booked in consulting in the November quarter, which was the second largest in recent memory. We see some near-term softness in certain segments, but we believe new contracts are ramping up. For FY 15, we see a 6.5% revenue gain.""GameStopGameStop is expected to report fourth quarter EPS of $1.93 on revenue of $3.79 billion, compared to last year's EPS of $2.16 on revenue of $3.56 billion.Merrill Lynch gave GameStop a neutral rating with a $43.00 price objective on March 18. The analysts at Merrill Lynch noted that the competition from Walmart would provide a challenge for the company in the future.""WMT announced today that, as of March 26, consumers will be able to trade in games in Walmart and Sam's Club stores, as well as online. In return, consumers will receive store credit that can be used across WMT's formats. Later this year, WMT will begin selling ""certified pre-owned"" games. The logistics and refurbishment process will be handled by CExchange, an online CE refurb retailer, focused primarily on CE and mobile products. While we view this as another multiple headwind to GME, ultimately, we do not think that it bears a meaningful risk to their used-gaming business (27% of sales, 44% of GP), as it is a very difficult business to scale and manage. We note that, in 2011, BBY entered the used-gaming business and was largely unsuccessful. GME management has stated that BBY's entry had no impact to their business and we believe the same will be true with WMT.""Credit Suisse had a similar view on March 5th with a neutral rating and a $46.00 price target.""Risks to our $46 target price are: GME faces significant risk from the large discounters and consumer electronics retailers as they expand in the video game business due to the new gaming cycle. As well, GameStop faces risk to the extent that the US consumer slows down spending from its current rate and is exposed to European macro factors as the company has store locations abroad.""S&P Capital gave GameStop a strong Buy rating with a $60.00 price target on February 1st as the firm is expecting to see strong growth in gaming sales.""We see FY 15 (Jan.) revenues increasing 8.1%, to $9.8 billion, from the $9.1 billion we expect in FY 14. Our forecast reflects strong growth in new video game hardware sales following the November 2013 release of two new game consoles. We expect the new console launches to drive increased trade-in activity and growth in sales of used video game products. We also see growth in sales of digital content and mobile devices.""BlackBerryBlackBerry is expected to report a fourth quarter loss of $0.56 per share on revenue of $1.13 billion, compared to last year's EPS of $0.22 on revenue of $2.68 billion.S&P Capital IQ gave Blackberry a hold rating on March 15th with at $10.00 price target. The firm was concerned about Blackberry's difficult road ahead as it has faced a huge loss of subscribers.""Our hold recommendation on the shares reflects our concern regarding subscriber losses and difficulty in rebuilding enterprise relationships. BlackBerry recently agreed to sell $1.25 billion of convertible notes to a group of investors including Fairfax Financial. We believe the appointment of CEO John Chen is a positive for the company as he has already made several key hires. We expect the company to focus on physical keyboards, security, and monetizing software. However, we believe the company still has a long way to go to rebuild its relationships with enterprises, particularly those that have already left the platform.""Wells Fargo gave BlackBerry a market perform rating on February 19th, nothing that the company will need to change course in order to recover.""With a potential sale of the company less likely in the near-term, we believe BBRY will likely look at other strategic alternatives (further restructuring, potential divestitures, aggressively target multi-platform strategy, etal). Upside risk could come from potential strategic actions.""Economic ReleasesInvestors will be focused primarily on US economic data this week after the US Federal Reserve surprised markets by insinuating that it plans to increase its interest rate sooner than expected. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's address following the meeting led most to believe that the bank sees the US economy as strong enough to stand on its own as early as next year. After a spate of poor economic data, which was largely attributed to the nation's severe winter, most are anxious to see further data like GDP and PMI figures to get a better picture of the US' economic health.Daily ScheduleMondayEarnings Releases Expected: Renesola Ltd.

Shutterstock photoJob growth isn't just good news for the economy. Payroll services providers such asPaychex (  ) stand to gain as companies expand and hire more workers.Friday's news that employers added a higher-than-expected 175,000 jobs in February could mean more business for the Rochester, N.Y.-based company, which also handles human resources and employee benefits for some 570,000 small and midsize U.S. companies.The U.S. job market directly affects Paychex, so low job growth and high unemployment can result in tough times. Its annual earnings-per-share growth streak skidded to a halt in fiscal 2009 and 2010, as the economy fell into recession amid the financial crisis.But it's been back on the growth track since, with analysts expecting a 6% gain for the fiscal year ending in May and 8% next year.Paychex's three-year EPS growth rate is 6%, as is its sales growth rate for the same period. Its three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1, on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile), reflects that slow but steady growth.The company carries no long-term debt, and return on equity -- which measures how well management uses its capital -- was 34.6% in 2013. That's well above the 17% minimum threshold investors should seek.Its quarterly dividend payout has trended higher over the past two decades, from 3 cents a share in 1989 up to 31 cents by mid-2008. But when the U.S. fell into recession in 2008 and '09, Paychex halted increases until October 2011, though it continued paying a dividend.It now pays out a quarterly 35 cents a share, or $1.40 a year, for an annualized yield of 3.3%. That compares with the S&P 500's average yield of 1.87%.The stock rose 46% last year, outperforming the S&P 500's 30% gain, before pausing to start working on a potential base. It's trying to climb back above its 10-week moving average and is 8% off its Jan. 7 intraday high.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Bullish Jobs Data Could Boost Paychex's Prospects@2014-03-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bullish-jobs-data-could-boost-paychexs-prospects-2014-03-11

hares of  (  ) increased 3.39% in after-hours trade after the company reported third-quarter 2014 earnings of 44 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. On a year-over-year basis, reported earnings per share increased 10.4%.Paychex reported total revenue (including Interest on funds held for clients) of $636.5 million for the quarter which not only increased 7.3% from the year-ago period but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $627.0 million.Excluding Interest on funds held for clients, which was down 3.7% on a year-over-year basis, total services revenues (Payroll service and Human Resource Services) increased 7.5% from the year-ago quarter to $626.0 million. Interest on funds held for clients was down due to lower average interest rates earned and lower net realized gains, which more than offset the increase in average investment balances.Payroll Service segment revenues increased 5.1% from the year-ago period to $413.9 million primarily driven by higher checks per payroll and revenue per check. Checks per payroll increased 1.0% from the year-ago quarter. The company witnessed modest growth in revenue per check on the back of price increases and higher adoption of Paychex's products.Buoyed by growth in client base in the retirement services, HR Solutions and eServices products, Paychex's Human Resource Services segment generated revenues of $212.1 million, which increased 12.4% from the year-ago quarter.Paychex's total expenses increased 4.8% from the year-ago quarter to $385.8 million, primarily due to compensation-related expenses. Moreover, higher expenses related to investment in product development and supporting technology and higher sales-related costs were responsible for the rise in expenses. Nonetheless, total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 147 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis due to higher revenue base.Paychex reported operating income of $250.7 million, up 11.4% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth supported by better cost management and capacity utilization. Operating margin was 39.4% versus 37.9% in the year-ago quarter.Excluding Interest on funds held for clients, Paychex's operating income came in at $240.2 million or 38.4% of total services revenue which increased from $214.1 million or 36.8% of total services revenue.Net income for Paychex increased 10.8% from the year-ago quarter to $160.1 million or 44 cents per share while net margins expanded 77 bps on a year-over-year basis.Paychex exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $271.3 million versus $213.0 million at the end of the previous quarter. Corporate investments were $314.4 million compared with $250.4 million in the previous quarter. Paychex has no long-term debt.During the third quarter, Paychex repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $43.9 million. Year-to-date, the company generated operating cash flow of $705.8 million.Paychex reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2014. Management expects 3-4% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago period. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 10.0% to 11.0%.Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 5-6%. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2014 are expected to be affected by low interest rate. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenues is expected to be 38.0% for fiscal 2014. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2014 is expected in the range of 36-37%. Management expects net income to increase in the range of 9% to 10% (previous guidance was 8% to 9%).Paychex reported better-than-expected third-quarter results primarily boosted by modest revenue growth and margin expansion. Moreover, Paychex's reiteration of its fiscal 2014 outlook signifies that it is relatively well-paced amid the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Moreover, we remain encouraged by management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe the company's expansionary initiatives through joint ventures and acquisitions should bode well for its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and competition from  (  ) and  (  ) remain the possible headwinds for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors can also consider  (  ), which carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex's Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates - Analyst Blog@2014-03-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychexs-q3-earnings-beat-estimates-analyst-blog-2014-03-27

n a concerted effort to extend its geographical footprint, business services provider  (  ) recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held printing and graphic product producer People & Print Group B.V. for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to form a behemoth in its category with complementary product offerings, operating synergies and technological collaboration to serve a wide spectrum of customers across the globe.Based in Deventer, the Netherlands, People & Print Group offers a complete solution for printing and graphic related products through a personalized touch for a unique appeal. Its product portfolio comprises business cards, posters, photos on canvas and giant banners, which are largely produced in-house for a fast, flexible and cost-effective delivery. Since its inception as a novel concept in 2005, People & Print Group has evolved as one of the top players in the European printing market handling 1,600 orders on an average per day in 2013 with approximately 175 employees.Focusing primarily on the Dutch and Belgian markets, People & Print Group has several online customer-friendly websites, including its most well-known site, Drukwerkdeal.nl. With a dedicated aftersales service, it boasts of a steady crop of repeat customers, including local printers, design agencies and resellers, as well as small businesses that have the ability to create and upload graphic design files.The combined entity has a complementary product portfolio that is likely to result in improved customer value proposition and profitability over time through economies of scale. The acquisition brings together two similar working cultures and extends the core customer group served by the respective companies. The deal particularly combines People & Print Group's production innovation and customer relationship expertise with Vistaprint's technology and manufacturing prowess to form an undisputed leader in the industry.To start with, Vistaprint intends to operate the People & Print Group brands as an independent and focused subsidiary with a distinct value proposition and separate brand positioning. However, over the years, products from the respective brands are expected to be introduced to the other to extend the product offerings of the combined entity.With People & Print Group on board, Vistaprint has an easy access to the Dutch and the Belgian markets. It also gains a solid foothold in the highly fragmented small business market with a devoted customer base and a diversified product portfolio of the People & Print Group. On the other hand, the merger enables People & Print Group to better serve its own customers by leveraging Vistaprint's scale, financial strength, technology and manufacturing expertise.The acquisition is expected to close by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. People & Print Group workforce will join the Vistaprint team, but will continue to operate its own brands. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to Vistaprint's fiscal 2014 earnings, although it is likely to come up with an updated guidance and commentary regarding the transaction sometime later.Despite this strategic acquisition news, share prices of Vistaprint remained relatively flat and closed the trading session on Feb 18 at $50.98. However, we see a healthy growth potential for Vistaprint post integration.Vistaprint currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Besides Vistaprint, stocks that look promising and are worth considering for now include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vistaprint to Acquire Dutch Firm - Analyst Blog@2014-02-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vistaprint-to-acquire-dutch-firm-analyst-blog-2014-02-19
n Feb 4, Zacks  upgraded business services provider  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) largely on the back of impressive second quarter fiscal 2014 results. The stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 23.4x and has long-term earnings growth expectation of 23.3%.Solidly executing on its operational plans, Vistaprint recorded a healthy year-over-year increase in revenue and earnings in the last reported quarter. Net income for second quarter fiscal 2014 almost doubled to $40.9 million from $23.0 million in the year-earlier quarter. On a per share basis, earnings for second quarter fiscal 2014 were $1.18 compared with 66 cents in the year-ago quarter.Total revenue in second quarter fiscal 2014 increased 6.5% year over year to $370.8 million. The year-over-year increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a strong holiday performance across the globe with continued improvements in customer engagements.Vistaprint's business is scalable and the increased top line will likely result in margin expansion in the long run. The company's web presence and online tools for customer use are well established. While additional demand would result in various capital investments such as additional printing presses, these fixed costs would be spread over a wider revenue base. The company has historically displayed strong fundamentals, which we expect will continue going forward.Additionally, the company expects mid-teen revenue growth in North America in the near term. The company has been making efforts to stabilize the business conditions in Europe through better pricing, advertising and product quality. Vistaprint expects capital expenditures in the range of $80 million to $90 million in fiscal 2014, which will be primarily utilized to support the growth of its business.The company is also making healthy progress with investments in new markets and the business strategy is now focused on higher quality products and delivery, increased customer service and more transparent pricing, which is designed to promote long-term customer relationships. All these initiatives augur well for the growth prospects of the company over the long haul.Over the last 7 days, most of the earnings estimates for fiscal 2014 were revised upward and we anticipate an uptrend for the stock backed by its strong growth potential. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2014 is pegged at $2.01, which represents 67.8% year-over-year growth.Besides Vistaprint, stocks that look promising and are worth considering now include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Vistaprint Upgraded to Strong Buy - Analyst Blog@2014-02-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vistaprint-upgraded-to-strong-buy-analyst-blog-2014-02-07

Earnings also improved from 80 cents in the year-ago quarter.Barrett reported gross revenues of $779.3 million in the fourth-quarter of 2013, up 30.6% from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were marginally ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $779.0 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to continuous increase in the company's co-employed client count as well as improvement in same-store sales.Professional employer service fees grew 31.9% year over year to $742.2 million, primarily driven by new client additions. Revenues from Staffing Services were $37.1 million, up 9.6% from the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to an increase in new businesses. Staffing business from existing customers remained flat on a year over year basis.Barrett's gross margin decreased 61 basis points on a year over year basis to 3.1% primarily due to a decrease in Direct payroll cost as a percentage of revenue (25 basis points year over year)..The company's operating expenses increased 26.9% from the year-ago quarter to $17.5 million, primarily due to higher incentive pay and increases in payroll expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). As a percentage of revenue operating expenses contracted 6 basis points to 2.3%.Higher-than-expected operating expenses led to a decline in operating margin. Operating margin came in at 0.9%, down from 1.4% in the year-ago quarter. Barrett reported net income (excluding workers' compensation reserve) of $8.7 million or $1.16 per share compared with $5.8 million or 80 cents in the year-ago quarter.Barrett exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $113.3 million compared with $42.1 million in the previous quarter.

 (  ) reported adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings were down 48.9%.Although Insperity's fourth-quarter revenues of $557.1 million increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $561 million. The year-over-year improvement was attributed to higher average paid worksite employees. The company reported average client retention of 99% during the quarter. However, net hiring from its clients was low.Insperity's gross margins were down 141 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 16.2% primarily due to higher-than-anticipated healthcare costs.The company's operating expenses increased 7.1% from the year-ago quarter's costs related to training of Business Performance Advisors and the reform strategy regarding healthcare related costs. Operating margins came in at 1.2% compared to 2.9% in the year-ago period primarily due to higher operating expenses.Insperity's adjusted net income decreased from $11.9 million or 47 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter to $6.2 million or 24 cents per share.Insperity exited the fourth quarter with cash, marketable securities and restricted cash of $277.7 million compared to $259.6 million in the previous quarter. The company has paid dividends of $17.4 million and repurchased shares worth $17.2 million during fiscal 2013.Insperity expects gross profit per worksite employee per month in the range of $247-$241 for first-quarter 2014 and $248-$258 for fiscal 2014. The company expects operating expenses in the range of $90.5-$91.5 million for the first quarter and $362.5 - $367.5 million for fiscal 2014.For fiscal 2014, Insperity expects its earnings per share in the range of $1.16 to $1.60, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70 per share.Insperity provides human resources as well as business solutions to small and medium business to help them perform better. The company reported mixed fourth-quarter results wherein the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but the bottom line scraped past the same. Margins were also impacted by higher-than-expected expenses.Nonetheless, we believe management's initiatives to expand the number of Business Performance Advisors and implement healthcare reform strategy will be beneficial in the long run. Moreover, the company's software-as-a-service and other adjacent business services are also gaining traction which are expected to improve the 2014 results.A debt-free balance sheet, share repurchases and dividend payouts are positives, but increasing expenses, stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are concerns.Currently, Insperity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Insperity Beats on Q4 Earnings; Down Y/Y - Analyst Blog@2014-02-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insperity-beats-on-q4-earnings-down-y-y-analyst-blog-2014-02-11
ue to late tax legislation, budget and debt agreements, and the 17-day government shutdown,  (  ) has lowered its second-quarter 2014 guidance. The company now expects a tax-revenue shift to the third quarter.Intuit expects second-quarter revenues to range between $775 and $780 million (previous guidance $890-$910 million). Non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of 1 cent-2 cents (previous 25 cents-27 cents).Due to the shift in revenues, the third-quarter forecast will now be higher than previous estimates. During the first-quarter earnings release, Intuit projected third-quarter revenues of $2.245 billion to $2.290 billion, with earnings of $3.25 to $3.30, reflecting seasonally strong third-quarter guidance.Despite the company's downward revision of its second-quarter forecasts, Intuit reiterated the fiscal 2014 outlook. For fiscal 2014, the company expects revenues in the range of $4.440 to $4.525 billion, representing 6.0% to 8.0% growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period is pegged at $4.49 billion.Non-GAAP operating income is projected at $1.58-$1.61 billion, representing 7.0% to 10.0% growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $3.52 and $3.60, reflecting 10.0% to 13.0% growth, significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.17 per share.This is reflective of Intuit's growing small and mid-sized business (SMB) exposure and the synergies from strategic acquisitions. The higher adoption rate of its cloud-based services and products is another positive factor. Moreover, the company's accelerated share buyback program would aid the bottom line.However, competition from leading payroll solution provider  (  ) and  (  ) in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concern us.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shutterstock photoFriday morning's employment report is going to be closely watched by investors. It will yield important clues as to whether the economy is improving fast enough and whether the Federal Reserve will ease its foot off the pedal just a little more.Some companies will benefit directly from bigger payrolls, among themPaychex (  ). The firm handles payroll, human resources and employee benefits for more than 570,000 mostly small and midsize companies.Since most job growth takes place among small businesses, the more payrolls created, the more work for Paychex, which means higher earnings and a robust dividend.The stock was a huge growth story in the 1990s, but has moved roughly sideways the past decade. Earnings dipped in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, but are recovering.Earnings in the two most recent quarters rose 5% and are expected to grow another 5% in the next report. EPS in 2014 are forecast to rise 6%, and 7% in 2015.Those numbers highlight an important point about Paychex. Its earnings may routinely come in at single-digit growth, but the operative word is routinely. Paychex has shown dependable growth.It has a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a 0 to 99 scale where low numbers correspond to steady earnings growth.Its return on equity, a measure of how well management uses its capital, is an impressive 35%. Pretax profit margins are 39%.That means Paychex can offer a stable dividend. The dividend remained unchanged during the recession, but the company began regular increases again in October 2011.It now pays out $1.40 a year, which works out to a 3.1% yield.The stock price reflects the earnings growth: slow but steady.Since early 2013, the stock has generally trekked the north side of its 10-week line.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Offers Steady Growth As Economy Recovers@2014-01-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-offers-steady-growth-economy-recovers-2014-01-09

Paychex (  ) reported results for Q2 FY 2014, posting total revenues of $600.5 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year. This is a faster y-o-y growth rate than what the company achieved during Q1 FY 2014. The slow growth in the company's Payroll Services division shows that the job situation in the United States is still affecting its growth prospects. November's job  showed that although unemployment levels had fallen, the drop in the figures wasn't driven by the number of people joining the workforce but by a high number of people dropping out of it. The absolute number of people employed is the main driver of Paychex' services. Payroll Service revenue increased only 5% during the quarter while revenues for its HR Outsourcing division jumped 12%. Going forward, we will be closely watching Payroll Service revenue growth, especially in the context of the jobs situation in the United States. Also, how well Paychex is able to leverage its payroll client base when selling its HR outsourcing services will be another factor to watch out for.According to our estimates, Paychex' Payroll Services division makes up approximately 70% of the firm's value. Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the second quarter and 4% through the first half of the fiscal year. The division benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check, which grew as a result of price increase. The second quarter growth also benefited from the absence of the disruptive effects of Hurricane Sandy a year ago. During the second quarter last year, Sandy impacted Paychex' payroll revenue growth by approximately 0.5%.The improving job outlook in the United States also bodes well for the company. As individuals in the U.S. continue to find jobs in similar numbers going forward, we could see the total employee count on Paychex' payrolls increase, which would cause an upside to our price estimate.During the second quarter, Paychex completed an acquisition of a payroll service provider in Germany. While operations in Germany are immaterial to the overall company results right now, the company is continuing to expand its global footprint with this acquisition and its start-up operation in Brazil.This division continues to be a primary growth driver for Paychex' revenues as it posted year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. The increase wasdriven primarily by client base growth, particularly in retirement services, Paychex HR Solutions, and eServices products. Additionally, revenues of the retirement services division also benefited from an increase in the average asset value of participants' funds. Insurance services revenue reflected higher premiums in workers' compensation insurance services and an increase in the number of health and benefits applicants.Overall, we think that the growth in this division is good news for Paychex as it diversifies the company's operations. Providing services such as retirement and insurance outsourcing gives Paychex a product line which it can sell to its existing customers, who currently use only the payroll services. We will be watching this division closely over the coming quarters, as it will be key to Paychex' growth.We are currently in the process of revising our  , which represents a downside of 22% to the market price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Improved Job Outlook and Growth in HR Outsourcing Boost Paychex' Revenues@2013-12-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/improved-job-outlook-and-growth-hr-outsourcing-boost-paychex-revenues-2013-12-31

he Employment Situation Summary for November released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on December 6, 2013, reported fall in unemployment levels to 7% from 7.8% a year earlier. However, this drop in employment was mostly a result of workers discouraged by a poor job market dropping out of the labor force. The data released on December 19, 2013 for Metropolitan Employment and Unemployment Situation puts these figures in a new light.The report showed that unemployment rates had fallen in more than 75% of the 372 areas covered. The unemployment rate was also lower than the national average of 7% in 204 of the 372 areas covered. As far as payroll processing companies such as ADP (  ) and Paychex (  ) are concerned, this is good news since they derive most of their revenues from clients based in these areas. During times of rising employment, companies hire more people which typically results in more employees per company. As a result, companies such as ADP and Paychex stand to earn more revenue from the increased number of clients served.In this article, we consider the impact the improving job situation can have on their value.ADP's primary source of revenue is its payroll processing business, which is directly related to the employment scenario in the U.S. economy and makes up approximately 40% of our value estimate for the company. We gauge the performance of this business based on the average fee received by ADP for every client it serves. When employment levels increase, ADP benefits from increase in hiring activity by its clients that boosts the fee earned per client.We forecast the average number of clients served to increase to 693,000 by the end of six years.

Shutterstock photoBigger payrolls could mean good times ahead forPaychex (  ), a provider of payroll, human resources and employee benefits outsourcing services for small and midsize companies.The Rochester, N.Y.-based company extended its quarterly profit growth streak for a 14th straight quarter after reporting fiscal Q2 results Wednesday after the close. It earned 43 cents a share, up 5% from the prior year and a penny over views.Revenue rose 7% to $610.5 million, as human resources services revenue jumped 12% and payroll services revenue 4%.Year-over-year profit gains have ranged between 2% and 14% the past 14 quarters. That stable growth shows up in its three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 and five-year factor of 5, on a 0 to 99 scale. The lower the number, the steadier the growth.Its annual earnings stumbled in fiscal 2009 and 2010 as the financial crisis took a toll on the economy, but has been back on the growth track since. With the economy and overall jobs picture improving, analysts forecast 6% growth in fiscal 2014 and 7% in 2015.Paychex's dividend payout has trended higher throughout the years. The firm didn't halt its dividend even during the leaner financial crisis years -- it just didn't increase the amount. It began boosting the dividend in October 2011, and has paid out 35 cents a share the past two quarters for an annualized yield of 3.2%. That's higher than the S&P 500's 2.43% yield.Its return on equity is 35% and has held at or above that level since fiscal 2008. Its ROE is well above the 17% threshold investors should aim for. Paychex also carries no debt.The stock bounced off support at its 10-week moving average and gapped up Thursday to a six-year high in heavy volume. It's been in a wide trading range since peaking in late 2000.

he US consumer is back! Cyber Monday is reportedly breaking all records this year. Early estimates by IBM () suggest around $2 Billion in online sales, a 20% increase year over year. Finally it seems the engine that drives the US recovery is revving up and everything in the garden is rosy!I don’t want to be a party pooper, but it seems to me that there is one piece of the puzzle missing…jobs. U.S. unemployment is still over 7%, a level that not too long ago would have been deemed disastrous. There are signs of a gradual improvement in the numbers, but there is evidence that the drop in the unemployment rate is at least partially a function of people leaving the workforce. That trend is expected to continue this Friday with the release of November jobs numbers. Analysts are forecasting a fall in Non-Farm Payrolls to around 185k, and a simultaneous drop in the unemployment rate to 7.2%.As is often a case with economic data, this drop in the labor participation rate has become intensely politicized. I am not interested in the political debate. It is logical that as baby boomers approach retirement age, a larger number of people stop looking for full time work. How much better or worse this would be if one or the other party was in power is irrelevant, the fact is that it is happening.In a world of increasing automation and globalization, it is hard to see a major boost to the employment situation coming any time soon. If anything, the pressure is likely to increase; drone deliveries and driverless cars don’t bode too well for delivery drivers, for example.So, it seems, we live in a time when even increasing economic activity and more money in the economy struggle to move the needle on jobs numbers…just ask the Fed. There is, however, one area of the employment data that shows consistent growth…part-time work. Again, I’m not interested in the politics of this. You can blame Obamacare, or ruthless corporations taking advantage of desperate young people, or old people with reduced retirement funds or whatever you like. In fact, according to  by The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the level of part time employees is within the normal parameters for a period of economic recovery, so the political arguments are probably just hot air. What is important is that it is happeningAs I look at all of this data and assess employment trends and underlying pressure, my trader’s mind has only one question; how do I trade my opinion? To that end I have been looking at two much traded stocks that are directly concerned with the employment situation, Manpower () and Paychex ().As you can see, and as you would expect, MAN and PAYX have followed a similar path this year, a path that can be summed up in one word, “up”. I believe, however that their fortunes are about to diverge. MAN looks like a decent buy, even here, but PAYX looks overvalued. Both have benefited from predictions of growth that assume that, as the economy improves, so will the employment market. That, as I pointed out earlier and in the words of the old song, ain’t necessarily so. It is quite possible that the slow economic recovery could continue or accelerate with what little impact there is on employment being soaked up by baby boomers taking part time jobs.One could argue that Manpower, as a temp agency, is better placed to take advantage of an increase in part time employment, and that is a part of the reason I prefer that stock, but only a small part. It is more to do with what has driven each stock higher this year. Manpower is coming off of a bad year in 2012, and owes much of its appreciation to improved performance, whereas Paychex advances are more to do with the anticipation of an improving market.PAYX’ EPS has increased by an average of under 2.5% in the last 2 quarters and the stock is up over 34% in the last year. MAN, by comparison, has gained over 105%, but has seen an average EPS increase of over 60% in their last two releases. Of course this sample is small and there are other factors at play, but it does illustrate that, while MAN has gone further, the appreciation there is based on actual results, rather than just expectations of a growing market. Forward P/E numbers further support the argument that the gains in MAN (P/E 17.49) are justified, while PAYX (P/E 25.79) is beginning to look a little overbought.Friday will see a release of fresh jobs data, and as always, the eyes of the market will be fixed on those numbers. If recent history and analysts estimates are to be believed, it is likely that the detailed report will once again show a slight decrease in the actual unemployment rate and a drop in the participation rate. Both MAN and PAYX will react to those numbers. To guard against any shock there, I would prefer a pure play on the relative strength of each stock, rather than a bet on the fortunes of one or the other. Thus shorting PAYX through options, futures or cash and then using the funds to establish a long position in MAN would be my favored trade.Whether you trade employment directly through the above mentioned stocks or more indirectly through general market exposure, though, avoid thinking that, just because the US consumer is back to spending on Cyber Monday, the jobs situation will improve dramatically. There are other, structural factors at play that could continue to pressure the labor market for years to come and some will undoubtedly come out of that better than others.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@2 Employment Stocks, 2 Different Outlooks@2013-12-03@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-employment-stocks-2-different-outlooks-2013-12-03

Its offerings include comprehensive payroll services, including payroll processing, payroll tax administration and employee pay services.We remain encouraged by the company's investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives through joint ventures and acquisitions should bode well for its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support.

Shutterstock photoA company likePaychex (  ) is a defensive stock that offers a dividend, but it's also somewhat cyclical.When hard times hit, payrolls are smaller, and that means a slowdown for companies like Paychex, which is an outsourcer for payroll, human resources and employee benefits for small and mid-sized companies.But good times are slowly returning to the Rochester, N.Y.-based company, which has more than 500,000 employer clients.Its earnings rose to $1.60 a share in the fiscal year ended in May, the highest ever, and are expected to grow moderately over the next two fiscal years. Earnings dropped in fiscal 2009 and 2010 as the financial crisis hit hard at the economy.The company was a huge growth stock in the 1990s, but has been moving in a wide trading range since hitting a top in late 2000. After the decline of earnings earlier in this decade, growth in both earnings and the stock have not recovered to the prior pace.The dividend rose with earnings and stock price. From 5 cents a share in 1990, the quarterly dividend rose to 31 cents by the middle of 2008. The company got through the tough times without lowering its dividend, but only started raising it again in October 2011. The past two quarters, it's paid out 35 cents a share, good for a yield of about 3%.The company has a five-year Earnings Stability Factor of 6 on a 0 to 99 scale, where low numbers correspond to steady growth.Analysts expect earnings to grow to $1.69, a 6% increase, in the current fiscal year and to $1.81 by fiscal 2015, a 7% increase.The company has a return on equity of 35%, well above the 17% investors should seek. That's particularly impressive when paired with the fact that the company has no debt.Its pretax profit margin is 39%.

hares of  (  ) dropped 7.89% on Friday, Nov 1, 2013, on lower-than-expected third-quarter 2013 earnings of 39 cents per share. The company's earnings per share not only lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents but also fell 13.3% on a year-over-year basis.Although Insperity's third-quarter revenues of $539.8 million increased 5.5% on a year-over-year basis, it failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $546 million. The year-over-year improvement was attributed to higher average number of worksite employees paid per month and increase in revenues per worksite employee per month.The company reported average client retention of 99% during the quarter. However, net hiring from its clients was low.Insperity's gross margins were down 118 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 18% primarily due to higher deficit in the benefits cost center. Moreover, a higher number of large health care claims also impacted margins.The company's operating expenses increased 1.3% from the year-ago quarter due to recruitment of extra Business Performance Advisors and the company's reform strategy related to the health care claims costs. Operating margins came in at 3.2% compared to 3.7% in the year-ago period primarily due to lower operating income per worksite employee per month.Insperity's net income decreased from $11.5 million or 45 cents reported in the year-ago to $10.1 million or 39 cents.Insperity exited the third quarter with cash, marketable securities and restricted cash of $259.6 million, down from $278.6 million in the previous quarter. Year-to-date, the company has repurchased shares worth $17 million and paid cash dividends of $13 million.Insperity expects gross profit per worksite employee per month in the range of $230-$232 for the fourth quarter of 2013. The company expects operating expenses in the range of $81 million-$82 million for the fourth quarterInsperity provides human resources as well as business solutions to small and medium business to help them perform better. Insperity reported dismal third-quarter results where both the top and bottom lines failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Margins were also impacted by higher-than-expected expenses.Nonetheless, we believe that management's initiatives to expand the number of Business Performance Advisors and implement health care reform strategy will benefit in the long run. Moreover, the company's software-as-a-service and other adjacent business services are also gaining traction which is expected to improve 2014 results.A debt-free balance sheet, share repurchases and dividend payouts are positive, but increasing expenses, stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are concerns.Currently, Insperity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Insperity's Q3 Earnings Lag Estimates - Analyst Blog@2013-11-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insperitys-q3-earnings-lag-estimates-analyst-blog-2013-11-04
 (  ) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Nov 21. Last quarter, it posted a negative surprise of 22.2%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Intuit reported wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter of 2013 and its revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, revenues increased year over year, primarily driven by strong performance of its business segments, higher costs led to contraction of margins and the subsequent decline in profits.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB (small & medium business) exposure and believe that the Demandforce acquisition will continue to support the segment.

However, stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider,  (  ), in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concern us.Our proven model does not conclusively project Intuit as likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Checks per payroll increased 1.6% from the year-ago quarter. The company witnessed modest growth in revenue per check positively impacted by price increases, which was partially offset by discounting. Management said that during the period, the client retention rate remained satisfactory.Buoyed by the growth in client base in the retirement services, HR Solutions and eServices products, Paychex's Human Resource Services segment generated revenues of $202.7 million, which increased 11.3% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, price increases positively impacted segment revenues for the quarter.Paychex has been expanding its Payroll and Human Resource Services in the South American countries leveraging a joint venture in Brazil.

Management expects these initiatives to drive growth for Paychex in the long run.Paychex's total expenses increased 3.7% from the year-ago quarter to $352.8 million, primarily due to compensation-related expenses. Moreover, higher expenses related to investment in product development and supporting technology and higher sales-related costs played its part in the rise in expenses. Nonetheless, total expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 80 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis due to higher revenue base.Paychex reported operating income of $255.8 million, up 7.2% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth supported by better cost management and capacity utilization. Operating margin was 42.0% versus 41.2% in the year-ago quarter.Excluding Interest on funds held for clients, Paychex's operating income came in at $245.1 million or 41.0% of total services revenue which increased from $227.9 million or 40.1% of total services revenue.Net income for Paychex increased 6.3% from the year-ago quarter to $162.8 million or 44 cents per share.Paychex exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $111.6 million versus $107.3 million at the end of the previous quarter. Corporate investments were $447.6 million compared with $398.2 million in the previous quarter.Additionally, Interest on funds held for clients decreased 1.0% year over year to $10.0 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Paychex reiterated its outlook for the fiscal 2014. Management expects 3%-4% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago period. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 9.0% to 10.0%.Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 5%-6%. Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2014 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenues is expected to be 38.0% for fiscal 2014. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2014 is expected to be in the range of 36%-37%. Net income is expected to grow 8% to 9%.Paychex reported better-than-expected first-quarter results primarily boosted by modest revenue growth and margin expansion. Moreover, Paychex's reiteration of its fiscal 2014 outlook signifies that it is relatively well-paced in contrast to the current macroeconomic sluggishness.Moreover, we remain encouraged by management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and focus on building its sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the company's expansionary initiatives through joint ventures and acquisitions should bode well for its long-term growth strategy.Product launches are also expected to provide additional support. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid-sized businesses looking for HR solutions could provide the company with opportunities.However, unfavorable interest rates and stiff competition from  (  ) and  (  ) remain the possible headwinds for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).

Revenues from Staffing Services were $41.7 million, up 15.3% from the comparable previous-year quarter led by increase in new businesses. The segment witnessed marginal increase in staffing business from existing customers.Barrett's gross margin improved 8 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 3.9% primarily due to higher revenue base.Although the company's operating expenses increased 32.1% from the year-ago quarter to $17.3 million, as a percentage of revenues operating expenses contracted 8 bps to 2.27%.This resulted in a 16 bps year-over-year expansion in operating margins. Also operating income increased 51.7% from the year-ago quarter to $12.9 million. Barrett reported net income of $9 million or $1.21 per share compared to $5.8 million or 81 cents in the year-ago quarter.Barrett exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $42.1 million compared to $14.2 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt balance was sequentially flat at $5.2 million.For the fourth quarter of 2013, Barrett expects gross revenues to increase 30.0% on a year-over-year basis and to range between $780.0 million and $790.0 million. Moreover, management expects fourth-quarter 2013 earnings to increase by at least 43.0% year over year and range between $1.15 and $1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.04 per share.Barrett registered incremental profit in the third quarter and also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth was encouraging given solid client growth. Management is quite hopeful about the coming quarter and expects strong business pipeline and a healthy client base.However, it is to be seen how the company's continued investments on operational infrastructure improvements rationalize margins in the near term. Moreover, increasing competition from  (  ) and  (  ) remain the headwinds, going forward.Currently, Barrett has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ayroll and human resource solutions provider,  (  ), is slated to release first-quarter 2014 results on Sep 30, 2013, after the closing bell. It is noteworthy that in the last quarter, Paychex recorded a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. The company has a trailing four-quarter average positive surprise of 2.57%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Paychex's fourth quarter witnessed growth across its services segment, primarily aided by Human Resource Services revenues. Growth in Human Resource Services revenues was driven by client growth and price increases. Also, increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check positively impacted Payroll service revenues. Moreover, the client retention rate was satisfactory.Moreover, the company's modest revenue growth supported by better cost management and capacity utilization boosted operating performance. However, Paychex's earnings remained flat on a year-over-year basis as the company incurred higher tax provision for a state income tax settlement.We are encouraged by Paychex's product development and focus on building sales force to support revenue growth. Moreover, Paychex's focus on small and mid sized business looking for HR solutions could provide the company with opportunities. However, the macroeconomic sluggishness coupled with growing competition from Intuit and Automatic Data Processing could be an overhang.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter stands at 43 cents with no estimate revisions witnessed in the last 60 days. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Our model states that a stock needs to have both a positive Zacks  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 to beat earnings estimates.

ayroll and human resource solutions provider,  (  ) recently discussed the impact of a possible shutdown of the federal government on small businesses nationwide.Paychex said that in a government shutdown, negotiations on tax abatement and many other activities, including audits could possibly be deferred. Though the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will continue to accept tax returns and other tax payments during a shutdown, applications from small businesses for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) may not be accepted for a while.Additionally, up to 1 million U.S. federal workers could face furloughs, implying that they would not receive any paychecks. Additionally, passport and visa applications could be put on hold.Apart from the potential market blows, companies expecting to raise funds from an initial public offering could face delays. Approval of small business loans and other lending functions could also stop during this event. Moreover, payments from federal government as well as capital-raising are likely to come to a halt.Despite the shutdown, several services such as National Weather Service, Social Security payments, air traffic control systems, Medicare, food inspections and veterans' benefits will remain unaffected. Moreover, prison guards, FBI agents, the Border Patrol and Air traffic controllers will stay on duty.There have been two similar shutdowns in the past 20 years, due to a partisan budget. The first government shutdown was for five days in 1995 and the second one was again in December for 21 days. According to government estimates, those shutdowns cost taxpayers approximately $1.4 billion.Paychex, Inc. is a provider of payroll and human resource (HR) outsourcing services for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).

The acquisition added an applicant tracking system to its portfolio, which will attract professional employer organizations as they will be able to reduce operating costs.Paychex reported fiscal fourth-quarter 2013 revenues of $585.3 million, up 6.1% from $551.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Payroll service segment revenues increased 3.5% year over year to $382.6 million. Checks per payroll grew roughly 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.

 's (  ) adjusted second-quarter 2013 earnings per share of 24 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents.

The year-over-year improvement was attributed to higher worksite employees and higher revenues per employee.Gross profit increased 12.0% from the year-ago quarter to $97.7 million. Gross margin was 17.9%, up from 16.8% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was led by higher gross profit per worksite employee per month.Total operating expenses surged 12.4% year over year, mainly due to increase in hirings and continuous investments (for expanding the Business Performance Advisors group and implementing health care reform strategy). Operating margin was 1.9%, slightly up from 1.8% in the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $12.9 million, down from $14.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Insperity reported net income of $3.5 million or 14 cents per share compared with $5.6 million or 22 cents in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted earnings per share were 24 cents. There were no one-time items recorded in the year-ago quarter.Insperity exited the second quarter with cash, marketable securities and restricted cash of $278.6 million, down from $326.2 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were roughly flat at $200.4 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased 60,000 shares worth $1.6 million and paid dividends worth $4.3 million.Insperity expects gross profit per worksite employee per month in the range of $260.0-$262.0 for the third quarter of 2013 and in the range of $261.0-$263.0 (previously $260.0-$263.0) for fiscal 2013.The company expects operating expenses in the range of $84.0-$85.0 million for the third quarter and in the range of $338.5-$339.5 million for fiscal 2013 (previously $340.5-$342.5 million).For fiscal 2013, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $1.52-$1.61 (previously $1.51-$1.61), given a tax rate of 40.0% and shares outstanding of 25.6 million.Insperity provides human resources (HR) as well as business solutions to small and medium business (SMBs) to help them perform better. Insperity's second quarter results were encouraging with both the top and bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though third quarter guidance seems weak on seasonality, we are encouraged by a better visibility into fiscal 2013.We believe that management's initiatives to expand the number of Business Performance Advisors and implement health care reform strategy will help it achieve its fiscal 2013 guidance.In an internal survey, Insperity found that most of the SMBs are willing to add employees in order to expand business activities. This will have a positive impact on Insperity's fundamentals.A debt-free balance sheet, share repurchases and dividend payouts are positive, but increasing expenses, stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are concerns.Currently, Insperity has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Insperity's 2Q Earnings Beat Estimates - Analyst Blog@2013-08-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insperitys-2q-earnings-beat-estimates-analyst-blog-2013-08-02

usiness and financial management solutions provider  (  ) is undertaking massive reorganization initiatives. After realigning some of its business operations in May, Intuit has now announced the divestiture of the Intuit Financial Services (IFS) business. It also plans to offload the Healthcare business and further realign its Accounting business. The reorganizations are part of Intuit's decision to focus more on core businesses i.e. tax preparation service and small business solutions.Intuit will sell the IFS unit to a private equity investment firm, Thoma Bravo for a cash consideration of $1.025 billion. The IFS unit provides digital (online and mobile) banking solutions to financial institutions. The unit, which was formed after acquiring Digital Insight for $1.35 billion in 2007, failed to match company expectations of performing in line with the core businesses.The divestiture will be completed within a few months. Post completion, Intuit expects the cash proceeds to fund upcoming share repurchases.Earlier, on May 20, 2013, Intuit announced realignment of its business operations into six go-to-market divisions that will report directly to the chief executive officer. The new divisions are as follows: (1) Small Business Financial Solutions (combination of QuickBooks, Payment Solutions, and the Intuit Partner Platform), (2) Small Business Management Solutions (comprising Employee Management Solutions and Demandforce), (3) Consumer Tax, (4) Consumer Ecosystem (focused on solving important consumer problems with solutions such as Quicken and Mint.com), (5) Accounting Professionals, and (6) Financial Services.As per the current reorganization plan, the Financial Services segment will be dissolved while the Accounting Professional segment will be further subdivided into two groups, namely Accountant and Advisor Group and ProTax.Intuit currently generates less than 5% of its total revenue outside the U.S. The recent announcement complements its plan to focus on expanding its international presence. The realignment will be effective from Aug 1, 2013.We believe that increased focus on SMB and Tax businesses will allow Intuit to boost its organic growth. But stiff competition from leading payroll solution provider  (  ) in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concern us.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2013 earnings of 34 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. The quarter's result was roughly flat year over year.Paychex reported fourth-quarter 2013 revenues of $585.3 million, up 6.1% from $551.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's revenues were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $588.0 million.Payroll Service segment revenues increased 3.5% year over year to $382.6 million. Checks per payroll grew roughly 0.9% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue per check grew modestly as a result of price increases, partially offset by discounting. Client retention rate was satisfactory.The Human Resource Services segment generated $192.7 million in revenues, up 12.6% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was mainly attributable to small market client growth and price increases, partially offset by lower contribution from professional employer organization.In the fourth quarter, Paychex incurred total expenses of $373.5 million, up 5.0% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as well as continuous investments in product development and supporting technology.Operating income was $211.8 million, up 8.1% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth supported by better cost management and capacity utilization. Operating margin was 40.5% versus 39.5% in the year-ago quarter.Net income of $123.5 million or 34 cents per share was roughly flat year over year. There was no one-time item during the quarter. During the quarter, Paychex recorded higher tax provision for the settlement of a state income tax matter.Paychex exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $107.3 million, up from $100.4 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments were $398.2 million compared with $470.2 million in the prior quarter.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 7.4% year over year to $10.0 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Paychex believes that Payroll Services revenue growth will be supported by modest growth in client base and improved revenue per check. Human Resources organic revenue growth is expected to follow the historical trend.For fiscal 2014, Paychex expects a 3-4% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 9.0% to 10.0%.Total service revenue will likely grow in the range of 5% to 6%. The company expects a 9-7% decline in interest on funds held for clients and 0-5% upside in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2014 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenues is expected to be 38.0% for fiscal 2014. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2014 is expected in the range of 36%-37%. Net income is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 9%.Paychex' fourth quarter results were disappointing with both the bottom and top lines missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth is being adversely affected by inadequate hiring by small and medium businesses. Paychex also provided fiscal 2014 guidance, which we believe is in line with the continuing macro uncertainties.We are encouraged by management's commentary regarding continued investments in product development and focus toward building sales force to support revenue growth. We also believe that the recent acquisition of HR Services Inc. and new product launches would provide additional support.Despite strict interest rates and stiff competition from  (  ) and Insperity, Paychex' zero European exposure will be beneficial for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy). Investors should also look into similar stocks that are performing better than Paychex.  (  ) and  (  ) both have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are worth buying.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex' Earnings & Rev Miss Est in 4Q - Analyst Blog@2013-06-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-earnings-rev-miss-est-in-4q-analyst-blog-2013-06-27
 (  ) is set to report fourth quarter 2013 results on Jun 27. Last quarter, it posted a 2.56% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Paychex' third quarter revenues grew 4.2% year over year on moderate growth of checks per payroll and revenues per check and client growth in HR Services segment, which was offset by discounting and lower contribution from professional employer organization.Operating margin improved as a result of better cost management and capacity utilization.Paychex believes that Payroll Services revenue growth will be supported by modest growth in client base and improved revenue per check.There are indications that small and medium businesses (SMBs) are performing better, given the gradual economic recovery. As per financial analysis firm Sageworks, total revenue at SMBs continued to increase in April and May. But the analysis also shows that recruitment at SMB firms is on the decline as they manage to execute effectively despite limited employee strength.Lower recruitment translates into lesser number of checks per payroll, which affects payroll solutions providers such as Paychex.Though lower recruitment could jeopardize Paychex' fundamentals, we believe the recent acquisition of HR Services Inc. and new product launches would provide some support.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter stands at 37 cents while that for fiscal 2013 stands at $1.60. Estimate revisions have been minimal in the last 60 days, with only one upward estimate revision for fiscal 2013.The lack of downward movement in estimates signals that the fourth quarter might be a good one. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.We expect the following stocks to beat earnings estimates in the upcoming quarters given positive Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP (Read:  ) and a favorable Zacks Rank. (  ), Earnings ESP of +9.09% and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ), Earnings ESP of +16.67% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"ayroll and human resource (HR) outsourcing service provider  (  ) recently announced the acquisition of HR Services Inc., a provider of comprehensive HR solutions for an undisclosed sum.Founded in 1993, Ohio-based HR Services specializes in providing HR Management solutions, tools and even conducting training sessions. The company's solutions primarily target the small and medium businesses (SMBs). HR Services' portfolio includes a software-as-a-service model namely, myStaffingPro. This web-based application system helps in tracking applicants and recruitment of the best suited candidates.Leveraging HR Services' expertise and its myStaffingPro app, Paychex will be able to offer innovative HR solutions and expand its served markets. Paychex will add myStaffingPro technology to its existing resources to boost its HR Services segment.In Dec 2012, Paychex acquired the expense management business (""ExpenseWire"") of Rearden Commerce Inc. for an undisclosed sum. ExpenseWire is an online solution that helps organizations to monitor and manage travel expenses of their employees. The expense management business was added to Paychex' HR Services segment.We believe that the addition of the applicant tracking system and expense management solution will attract professional employer organizations as they will be able to reduce operating costs.The company's initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging. Also, the improving trend in SMB IT spending could pave the way for Paychex in the coming quarters. But it is evident that low hiring in the small and medium business (SMB) sector (leading to lower checks per client) and lack of new business wins have come in the way of solid revenue growth.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

GAAP operating income is estimated between $1.23 billion and $1.25 billion (previously $1.315-$1.345 billion), reflecting growth of 5.0% to 6.0%. Non-GAAP operating income is projected in a range of $1.51-$1.53 billion (previously $1.57-$1.60 billion), representing growth of 8.0% to 9.0%. GAAP EPS is expected to grow in the range of 7.0%-8.0% to $2.77-$2.81 (previously $2.960-$3.022). Non-GAAP EPS is expected between $3.31 and $3.35 (previously $3.40-$3.46), indicating growth of 11.0% to 13.0%.Intuit expects revenues from TurboTax to grow roughly 4.0% for the fiscal 2013.Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered better-than-expected third quarter earnings driven by revenue growth. Intuit's first and fourth quarters are seasonally weak; hence the guidance was not unexpected. However, the lowering of fiscal 2013 guidance, which reflects lackluster Consumer Tax business given lower online tax filings, disappoints us.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB (small & medium business) exposure and believe that the Demandforce acquisition will continue to provide support to the segment. However, stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider  (  ) in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concern us.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). But not all software stocks are performing as badly as Intuit. Investors can have a look at  (  ) and  (  ), which have Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are worth buying.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intuit's 3Q Earnings Beat on Rev Growth - Analyst Blog@2013-05-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intuits-3q-earnings-beat-on-rev-growth-analyst-blog-2013-05-22

With employment figures the big news of the day, the business of human resources (  ) is still a good one.Technology is changing the HR landscape, and I believe that exposure to this industry is useful as part of a stock market portfolio-but at the right price.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ/ADP) out of Roseland, New Jersey is the blue-chip payroll and HR outsourcing firm that many regard as a technology stock. The company is a great barometer on employment, investor sentiment, and the stock market.Like many blue chips, Automatic Data Processing (  ) did nothing for 10 years after 2001. The stock broke out of its sideways trend in 2011.For such a mature enterprise, ADP has significantly increased in price over the last two years. I like this business, but I view it as fully priced, given current  .The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. (NASDAQ/ULTI) from Westin, Florida struggled initially to find its stride, but the stock (which is more than fully priced) has certainly found it now.This firm is a cloud provider of HR services and has a lot of growing corporations as customers.

Cash and marketable securities grew to $79.0 million from $68.0 million.Looking at revenues and earnings this first quarter, it's very clear that many large corporations actually are in better shape than they were this time last year.But the numbers also reveal weakness. And that weakness is in the ability of the marketplace to deliver real economic growth.The stock market has gone up as institutional investors bet that the U.S. economy will improve in the bottom half of the year. This is a possibility. have unprecedented amounts of cash to jumpstart the U.S. economy. But they still aren't spending; they are keeping it and returning more to shareholders. This is the real problem, and it's fostered by a continued state of uncertainty and nervousness.The Federal Reserve's unprecedented monetary actions have provided an environment in which institutional investors can buy the stock market.The result of ballooning amounts of cash and a continued lack of corporate investment, combined with ballooning amounts of monetary stimulus, in effect, have proven to cancel each other out.All the loose cash has created virtually nothing except a paper stock market gain.There continues to be a lack of real economic growth and genuine employment gains with greater labor force participation.Healthy balance sheets are extremely important.

Dealer Services revenue increased 8% on a year over year basis to $460.5 million.Interest on funds held for clients declined 16% year over year to $112.0 million.

 (  ) posted first-quarter 2013 earnings per share (EPS) of 54 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents.NCR reported revenues of $1.41 billion in the first quarter of 2013, up 13.3% from $1.24 billion in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year improvement in revenues was mainly due to an increase of 41.0% in Retail solutions and a 16.0% increase in Hospitality revenues.NCR is generating decent growth in software revenues across its segments, especially in SaaS. Moreover, the company is witnessing good business in line with its business expectation.Revenues from the Financial Services segment were $714.0 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by growth in the Europe, as well as Asia, the Middle East and Africa (AMEA) theaters, offset by lower revenues in the Americas.In the  segment, NCR completed the acquisition of Retalix, Ltd. The company generated revenues of $489 million, up 41.0% from the first quarter of 2012. The increase in revenues is driven by growth in the Americas, Europe and AMEA theaters. Moreover, excluding Retalix, revenue growth was 27.0% in the first quarter of 2013.The  segment witnessed a 16.0% increase in revenues and the growth can be attributed to an improvement in the American theater business. ' revenues were $76.0 million, down 15.0% from the first quarter of 2012, on both an actual and a constant currency basis. The decrease in revenues was mainly driven by declines in the Emerging Industries revenue in Americas and Europe theaters.Gross margin in the quarter was 26.2% versus 20.3% in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin looked good, up 120 basis points year-on-year. Gross margin moved up excluding the effect of Retalix in the quarter. Software was a key contributor to gross margin expansion.NCR reported a profit of $62.0 million or 37 cents per share in the reported quarter, compared with a loss of $10.0 million or 6 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding special items like impairment, pension expense, acquisition related transaction costs, amortization and legal settlement charges; non-GAAP income from continuing operations was 54 cents per share compared with 47 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities was $21.0 million during the first quarter of 2012, down from net cash generation of $100.0 million in the previous quarter. The decrease can be attributed to a change in working capital in anticipation of higher revenues in the upcoming quarters.NCR ended the first quarter of 2013 with $483 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $1.07 billion as of Dec 31, 2012, due to the acquisition of Retalix. As of Mar 31, 2013, NCR had a total debt balance of $2.09 billion.The company has raised its FY13 guidance. For the full-year 2013, NCR expects revenues to increase in the range of 9% to 11% compared with 2012.Moreover, NCR also expects its full-year 2013 income from operations (GAAP) in the range of $546 million to $566 million, while the non-pension operating income (NPOI) is expected to remain in the range of $700 million to $720 million.

The company reported decent first-quarter results, with revenues growing across all segments and EPS surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Given the ongoing improvement in NCR's Financial, Hospitality and Retail verticals, the company expects to report decent results for full-year 2013. NCR's growing exposure into ATM and self-service kiosks spaces is encouraging, given tremendous growth prospects in the respective markets.Though stiff competition in the ATM space, European exposure and high debt burden are concerns, we are optimistic on the stock given the continuous products launches and synergies from acquisitions.NCR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).One may consider other stocks that are going to report this earnings season.

 (  ) reported first-quarter 2013 earnings per share of 51 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter's earnings were 5.6% lower than 54 cents reported in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to higher investments for expanding the Business Performance Advisors group and implementing health care reform strategy. However, this was partially offset by higher gross profit per worksite employees.Insperity's first quarter revenues of $611.8 million increased 2.8% from $595.2 million in the year-ago quarter and were slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $615.0 million. The year-over-year improvement was attributed to a 1.2% increase in average paid worksite employees.Gross profit increased 5.0% from the year-ago quarter to $108.1 million. Gross margin was 17.7%, up from 17.3% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was led by higher gross profit per worksite employee per month.Total operating expenses surged 7.7% year over year. Operating margin was 3.6% compared with 3.9% in the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA) was $27.3 million, down from $27.6 million in the year-ago quarter.Insperity reported net income of $12.8 million or 51 cents per share compared with $13.5 million or 54 cents in the year-ago quarter.Insperity exited the first quarter with cash, marketable securities and restricted cash of $326.2 million, down from $328.6 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable increased 5.7% sequentially to $201.2 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased 472,211 shares worth $13.5 million and paid dividend of $4.3 million.Insperity expects gross profit per worksite employee in the range of $253.0-$255.0 for the second quarter of 2013 and in the range of $260.0-$263.0 for fiscal 2013. The sequential decrease is mainly due to seasonality.The company expects operating expenses in the range of $87.75-$88.5 million for the second quarter and in the range of $340.5-$342.5 million for fiscal 2013.For fiscal 2013, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $1.51-$1.61, given a tax rate of 40.0% and diluted shares outstanding of 25.6 million.Insperity provides human resources (HR) as well as business solutions to small and medium business (SMBs) to help them perform better. Insperity's first quarter results were disappointing with the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line matching the same. Though second quarter guidance seems weak on seasonality, we are encouraged by a better visibility into fiscal 2013.We believe that management's initiatives to expand the number of Business Performance Advisors and implement health care reform strategy will help it achieve its fiscal 2013 guidance.In an internal survey, Insperity found that most of the SMBs are willing to add employees in order to expand business activities. This will have a positive impact on Insperity's fundamentals.A debt-free balance sheet, share repurchases and dividend payouts are positive, but increasing expenses, stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) are concerns.Currently, Insperity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Insperity's 1Q Earnings In Line, Revs Miss - Analyst Blog@2013-05-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insperitys-1q-earnings-in-line-revs-miss-analyst-blog-2013-05-02

Premiums rose from $1.22 to $1.40, but most of the options priced in the middle of that range.These  lock in the price where investors can buy shares in the payroll processor, which is parked at its highest level in almost five years. If it breaks resistance and continues to run, those options stand to generate significant leverage. And if it drops, traders will lose much less money than they would owning shares. (See our  section for more on how options can be used to manage risk.)PAYX ended the session at $36.41, up 0.78 percent.

Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP (  ), which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at +120.0%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. LinkedIn carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 (  ) posted first quarter 2013 loss per share of 36 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents loss per share.Barrett reported net revenue of $111.6 million in the first quarter, up 35.3% from $82.4 million a year ago. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the continued increase in the company's client count and same-store sales.Professional employer service fees grew 45.6% year over year to $81.8 million. Revenues from Staffing Services were $29.7 million, up 13.4% from the comparable quarter last year.Management acknowledged the solid client base and asserted that client retention was strong. The company attributed the solid results in the quarter to BBSI's maturing brand and strong referral channels, which helped attract new clients and retain the existing ones.Reported gross profit was $8.3 million, up 26.8% year over year. But gross margin fell 50 basis points to 7.5% from the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses in the first quarter were $12.3 million, up 21.4% from the year-earlier quarter. The increase in operating expenses was due to 21.0% growth in selling, general & administrative expenses and 32.2% growth in research and development expenses.Reported operating loss in the quarter was $4.0 million compared to an operating loss of $3.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was (3.5%) compared to (4.3%) in the year-ago quarter.Reported net loss was $2.5 million or 36 cents per share compared to a net loss of $2.2 million or 22 cents in the comparable quarter last year.Barrett exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $67.0 million, up from $62.5 million in the prior quarter. Long-term debt balance was sequentially flat at $5.2 million.For the second quarter of 2013, the company expects earnings per share to range between 68 cents and 72 cents, up from 52 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter and fiscal 2013 are pegged at 69 cents and $2.21 per share, respectively.Though Barrett registered a loss in its first quarter, the results were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth was encouraging given solid client growth. Management's commentary of maintaining a strong business pipeline and a healthy client base is encouraging. But the company's continued investments for operational infrastructure improvements could jeopardize margins in the near term.Currently, Barrett has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

taffing firm  (  ) is set to report its first-quarter 2013 results on Apr 23 after the market closes. Last quarter, it posted a 2.4% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Strong revenue growth boosted by continued demand for specialized staffing and consulting services, particularly in the U.S. proved to be Robert Half's strength in the fourth quarter. Further, the improving global economic condition has heightened the demand for the company's temporary and permanent staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services.Robert Half witnessed strong revenue growth in each of its business segments. Earnings of 42 cents increased 40% from the year-earlier quarter, marking the 11 th straight quarter of more than 20% increase. Gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 40.3% in the quarter while operating margin increased 200 basis points to 9.4% on the back of higher gross margins, lower operating expenses and solid perfrmance of the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Protiviti. However, currency headwinds and a tough job scenario, particularly in Europe, resulted in soft demand for recruitment services.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Robert Half is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive earnings Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as shown below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. Robert Half's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) lowers the predictive power of ESP because the Zacks Rank #3 when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies in the business services sector you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ) with Earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) (  ) with Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) (  ) with Earnings ESP of +1.14% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Robert Half - Analyst Blog@2013-04-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-robert-half-analyst-blog-2013-04-22
" (  ) posted third-quarter 2013 adjusted earnings per share (""EPS"") of $2.10, comprehensively beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79.Revenues during the quarter increased 24.0% year over year to $3.76 billion and were above the company's guidance range of $3.55-$3.65 billion. Western Digital surpassed its revenue guidance primarily due to better-than-expected business and product demand, as well as restricted price declines.The drives having a capacity of 810 gigabytes were exported during the reported quarter, which witnessed a 35% year-over-year increase. Western Digital also witnessed momentum in its branded and enterprise businesses and a good product mix-up in the company's client business to cope with the ever-increasing amount of digital content.WDC's focus on the growth trends in digital data supported the robust results from the HGST and WD subsidiaries.Gross margin in the reported quarter was 28.2% versus 32.2% in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin was 29.2%, which excludes $38.0 million related to amortization expense to acquire intangible assets of HGST. This apart, non-GAAP gross margin exceeded the guidance by 120 basis points.Operating margin for the quarter was 11.1%, down from 17.9% reported in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expense increased 48.0% due to higher research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense.Net income for the quarter was $391.0 million or $1.60 per share, up from $483.0 million or $1.93 per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of HGST, employee termination benefits and other charges, non-GAAP/adjusted net income was $514.0 million or $2.10 per share, down from $619.0 million or $2.52 per share in the year-ago quarter.The company generated $727.0 million from cash from operations in the third quarter, down from $772.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $4.06 billion, up from $3.82 billion in the previous quarter.Out of the capital being allocated to the company, the company has repurchased 5.2 million shares for $243 million during the reported quarter.For the fourth quarter, Western Digital also expects the market share to remain unchanged. The company expects revenues in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion, while gross margin is expected to be well within the company's model at approximately 28.5%. We expect R&D and SG&A spending to be approximately $550 million, which excludes the amortization of HGST intangibles. Moreover, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.65 and $1.80 for the fourth quarter.The company's third-quarter earnings exceeded our expectation, and revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. The company witnessed decent product demand and the price declines moderated.Moreover, decent performance by Western Digital's HGST and WD subsidiaries helped the company perform better in the third quarter, and it continued to capitalize on the secular growth of digital data.We are also encouraged by Western Digital's growing exposure in the small and medium business (SMB) space. Recently, the company expanded its SMB product suite. Higher IT spending from the SMBs is a good sign and we believe that Western Digital is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity. On the other hand, decline in PC sales may affect business going forward.Currently, Western Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 Rank (Hold). Investors can also consider other technology stocks. (  ) has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy),  (  ) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and  (  ) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@WDC Beats Earnings Est, Revs Up - Analyst Blog@2013-04-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wdc-beats-earnings-est-revs-up-analyst-blog-2013-04-25

Average volume of shares traded over the last three months stand at approximately 2764K.Paychex delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last quarter with an average beat of 2.5% for the past four quarters.

The revenue growth was mainly due to higher checks per payroll and revenues per check, client retention and client growth. Revenues from Payroll Service segment increased 1.9% year over year, while Human Resource Services segment revenues grew 9.7% from the prior-year quarter.Operating margin improved 60 basis points to 43.0% buoyed by modest revenue growth, supported by better cost management and capacity utilization.For fiscal 2013, Paychex believes that Payroll Services revenue growth will be supported by modest growth in client base and improved revenue per check. Human Resources organic revenue growth is expected to follow the historical trend. Paychex will continue to invest heavily on product development.Following the third quarter results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 remained flat at $1.60. But the estimate for 2014 was up by a penny to $1.71 supported by 5 upward estimate revisions. There were no downward revisions in the past 7 days.We believe that Paychex' stock price will go up as employment in the small and medium business (SMB) space is improving.

Shutterstock photoWhile Friday's downbeat jobs report knocked back the overall  , it especially pressured companies with a strong link to the nation's employment situation.Paychex (  ) is one such company, and its shares slumped Friday just a few sessions after reaching a multiyear high. The Rochester, N.Y., firm provides payroll processing, along with other services related to human resources and benefits. It claims more than half a million small to midsize businesses as customers.Even with Friday's drop, Paychex is worth a look for investors seeking a stock with a relatively high dividend yield, modest growth potential and generally positive chart action. It pays a quarterly dividend of 33 cents a share. That works out to an annual yield of about 3.7%, sizable in today's environment.But note that Paycheck joined the rush of dividend payers that accelerated dividend payments at the end of 2012 in order to help shareholders avoid higher taxes. So quarterly payouts that would have come in February and May were delivered this past December.The company hasn't displayed big growth lately, but its gains have been steady and accelerating. EPS increased 2%, 5% and 8% over the past three quarters, with 9% growth expected in the next report. Paychex's three-year EPS Stability Factor is an impressive 1, close to the calmest possible grade of 0.In terms of chart action, Paychex shows a consolidation that dates back to September and featured resistance around the 34 level. On Wednesday, the stock rose as high as 35.95, but it then pulled back toward 34 in Friday's session.One concern is a drop in the past two quarters in the number of U.S. funds with a stake. Fidelity Contrafund sold its stake recently, according to IBD data.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Jobs News Puts Paychex Back Near Previous Resistance@2013-04-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jobs-news-puts-paychex-back-near-previous-resistance-2013-04-05

 (  ) reported third-quarter fiscal 2013 earnings of 40 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The quarter's result was 6.3% above the year-ago level.Paychex reported third-quarter 2013 revenues of $593.3 million, up 4.2% from $569.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's revenues were slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $593.0 million.Payroll Service segment revenues increased 1.9% year over year to $393.7 million. Checks per payroll grew roughly 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue per check grew modestly as a result of price increases, partially offset by discounting.The Human Resource Services segment generated $188.7 million in revenues, up 9.7% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was mainly attributable to client growth and price increases, partially offset by lower contribution from professional employer organization and unfavorable product mix.In the third quarter, Paychex incurred total expenses of $368.3 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as well as continuous investments in product development and supporting technology.Operating income was $225.0 million, up 6.9% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth supported by better cost management and capacity utilization. Operating margin was 43.0% versus 42.4% in the year-ago quarter.Net income of $144.5 million in the reported quarter reflected a 6.7% increase from $135.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Earnings per share were 40 cents compared with 37 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Paychex exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $100.4 million, down from $122.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments were $470.2 million compared with $178.6 million in the prior quarter.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 0.9% year over year to $10.9 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Paychex believes that Payroll Services revenue growth will be supported by modest growth in client base and improved revenue per check. Human Resources organic revenue growth is expected to follow the historical trend. Financial guidelines were maintained for fiscal 2013.For fiscal 2013, Paychex expects a 2%-3% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 9.0% to 11.0%.Total service revenue will likely grow in the range of 5% to 6%. The company expects an 8%-6% decline in interest on funds held for clients and nil-5% upside in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2013 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenues is expected in the range of 37.0%-38.0% for fiscal 2013. Net income is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%.Paychex' third-quarter results were decent, with both the bottom and top lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Though Paychex mentioned that revenue growth could be stronger during the fourth quarter, the guidance for fiscal 2013 was maintained. We believe that the conservative guidance was mainly due to macro uncertainties.We are encouraged by management's commentary regarding continued investments in product development and focus toward building sales force to support revenue growth.However, lingering unemployment situation, strict interest rates and stiff competition from  (  ) and Insperity (NSP) keep us concerned. However, Paychex' zero European exposure will be beneficial for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks Rank # 4 (Sell). Investors should also look into similar stocks that are performing better than Paychex.

 (  ) is one of the two major publicly traded payroll processors in the United States. The company generates revenues by processing employee payrolls which includes paper and electronic distribution of employee compensation along with the processing of tax withholdings and other employee contributions. The company primarily competes with much bigger ADP (  ), which has a market capitalization of approximately $30 billion compared with Paychex's market capitalization of $12 billion.Paychex generated approximately $2 billion in revenues and had EBITDA margins of approximately 42% in 2012, and we think that both of these metrics will rise over our forecast period. The company has two primary divisions, payroll processing, which makes up 60% of the firm's value, and HR outsourcing, which make up over 30% of value.As mentioned above, Paychex's payroll processing division makes up approximately 60% of the firm's value. The primary driver of this division is the number of employees per client payrolls, as the company gets paid on a per employee basis.We estimate that in FY 2012 the company was processing approximately 9.5 million employee payrolls, as it had 567,000 clients with an average of 17 employees per client. We think that both the average client employees and number of clients will increase over our forecast period to approximately around 19 and 620,000 respectively. The primary rationale for both of these forecasts is that we expect the global economy to improve in the next couple of years which should spur hiring growth and new business creation. In a scenario where the global economic environment in 2-3 years time worsened and the average employees per payroll client fell to 16 by the end of our forecast period, we would see approximately 10% downside to our price estimate.While Paychex's payroll division has been a relatively stable revenue source of revenues over the past couple of years, the company's HR outsourcing division has been the primary contributor of growth. The division's revenue increased 13% in FY 2012, primarily due to price increases and growth in both clients and client employees.As with the firm's payroll processing division, Paychex's HR outsourcing division is also dependent on the number of employee's the company serves. In FY 2012, the firm had approximately 615,000 client employees, and we expect this number to grow to approximately 800,000 by the end of our forecast period. The major driver of this growth will likely be the result of Paychex up-selling to existing clients and also a potential economic recovery in the United States, which will increase the number of employees at their existing clients. For sensitivity purposes, if the number of HR outsourcing client employees served stayed flat over our forecast period, we would see approximately 5% downside to our price estimate.We currently have a  , which is approximately 10% above the current market price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@A Snapshot Of Paychex's $35 Stock Value@2013-02-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/snapshot-paychexs-35-stock-value-2013-02-28

Reported revenues were in line with management's revised guidance range. The revenue decline was mainly due to shift in tax revenues from the second to the third fiscal quarter due to late legislation and Internal Revenue Service delays.Product revenues decreased 4.1% year over year to $402.0 million, while Services and Other revenues dropped 2.4% from the prior-year quarter to $566.0 million.Segment-wise, Small Business Group posted 16.0% year-over-year growth based on the strength of the group's sub-segments and the synergies from the acquisition of Demandforce on May 12. Financial Management Solutions revenues increased 17.0%, driven by higher subscription for QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Enterprise and contribution from Demandforce. Employee Management Solutions revenues were up 13.0%, led by growth in Intuit Online Payroll subscribers. Payment Solutions revenues increased 18.0%, aided by customer growth for Intuit's GoPayment mobile payment solution.The Consumer Tax segment posted 12.2% revenue decline due to shift in revenues (roughly $140.0 million). Financial Services revenues were up 1.0% from the year-ago quarter, led by higher revenues in online and mobile banking, and addition of the Mint business. This was partially offset by the sale of corporate banking business in Mar 2012. Accounting Professionals segment revenues decreased 7.0%. Other Businesses revenues declined 10.0% due to the shift of Mint business, partially offset by growth in global business.Reported gross margin decreased 100 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 78.5%. Operating margin in the quarter was 9.6% versus 19.5% in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses increased 11.4% year over year.GAAP net income from continuing operations was $71.0 million or 23 cents per share, compared with $121.0 million or 40 cents per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's result was lower than the company's guided range. Excluding one-time expenses but including stock-based compensation expenses, adjusted net income in the quarter was $71.2 million or 23 cents per share versus $129.6 million or 42 cents in the year-ago quarter.Intuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of $678.0 million, up from $558.0 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $541.0 million compared with $184.0 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt remained flat sequentially at $499.0 million.Intuit used $256.0 million of operating cash in the second quarter, as against $145.0 million cash used in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure was $45.0 million. During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $100.0 million. The company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 17 cents per share amounting to $51.0 million.For the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues in the range of $2.215 billion to $2.275 billion. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.315 billion. Non-GAAP operating income is estimated in the $1.350 billion to $1.375 billion range. GAAP EPS is projected in the range of $2.83 to $2.88. The company also expects non-GAAP EPS in the $2.99 to $3.04 range.For fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues in the $4.55 billion to $4.65 billion range, representing growth of 10.0% to 12.0%. GAAP operating income is estimated between $1.315 billion and $1.345 billion, reflecting growth of 12.0% to 14.0%. Non-GAAP operating income is projected in a range of $1.57-$1.60 billion, representing growth of 12.0% to 14.0%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to grow in the range of 14.0-16.0% to $2.96-$3.022. Non-GAAP EPS is expected between $3.40 and $3.46, indicating growth of 14.0% to 16.0%.Intuit is also likely to expand globally with the help of its connected services that are gaining traction. The increasing preference toward digital solutions is reflected by the growing popularity of its software-based TurboTax, SnapTax, QuickBooks small-business accounting solutions. The company looks forward to add more recurring revenues within its Consumer Tax and Small Business segments, capitalizing on the ongoing shift toward digital solutions.Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered a lower-than-expected second quarter driven by tax revenue shift to the third quarter. But we are encouraged by the third quarter guidance and we believe that the main driver would be the Consumer Tax business.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB (small & medium business) exposure and believe that the closure of the Demandforce acquisition will provide further support to the segment. But stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider  (  ) in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concerns us.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, not all software stocks are performing as badly as Intuit. Investors can have a look at  (  ) and  (  ), which have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are worth buying.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intuit Misses on Revenue Shift - Analyst Blog@2013-02-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intuit-misses-on-revenue-shift-analyst-blog-2013-02-22

 (  ) announced its Q2 FY13 earnings on February 5, reporting organic revenue growth of 6% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. Additionally, ADP also posted solid growth in its earnings per share from continuing operations of 7%, which was driven by the repurchase of 5.9 million shares in this fiscal year. Overall, we are encouraged by ADP's growth during the quarter and think that the firm's results show that it has capitalized on the uptick in U.S. employment in the last few months. Revenues for the company's biggest segment, payroll processing, grew by 7% year-over-year and the firm's client retention ratio grew by 80 basis points during the quarter. This quarter's performance strengthens our view that ADP's fundamental valuation is likely to remain relatively stable going forward.All of ADP's businesses posted solid growth during the quarter. Revenue for the firm's payroll processing division, which makes up approximately 80% of the company's value, increased 7% during the year. Additionally, auto dealer services and HR outsourcing services also posted growth of 11% and 13% respectively. What especially encouraged us was the fact that the company's client retention ratio increased 80 basis points. We think that this ratio is important because if ADP can maintain it going forward, it will have to find fewer new clients to maintain its current growth rate.We find it encouraging for ADP's long term prospects that the number of employees on its client payrolls increased approximately 2.6% year-over-year. We stress on this because it shows us that ADP was able to successfully capture the growth in the U.S. job market during the quarter. ADP's clients have continued to increase the number of employees on their payrolls in good times and bad, providing more evidence to us that the company can maintain a decent growth rate going forward.While the U.S. job market improved, the world economy continues to be plagued by uncertainty due to the Euro crisis and the U.S. budget situation. Therefore, the fact that ADP's clients have continued to hire employees during an uncertain economic environment, shows that their underlying businesses are likely to be fundamentally sound. This means that any improvement in the world economy could see them hiring a bigger proportion of workers relative to the overall economy.During the previous quarter's , ADP's management stated that it does not expect the economic environment to change much over the next fiscal year. Management's Q1 FY13 guidance was reiterated in Q2, as the company expects modest year-over-year revenue growth of around 5% in FY2013, which is relatively in line with our estimates.We currently have a  , which is approximately 2% above the current market price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADP's $61 Fair Value Is Hitched To The U.S. Recovery@2013-02-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adps-61-fair-value-hitched-us-recovery-2013-02-06

" (  ), specializing in payment processing services, is scheduled to announce its second-quarter fiscal 2013 results on December 19 after the closing bell. We notice that the analysts have maintained their estimates at this point.Paychex delivered modest first-quarter 2013 results, with earnings of 42 cents per share inching past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Revenues grew 2.7% year over year, backed by increases of 7.4% in Human Resource Service revenue and 0.9% in Payroll Service revenue. The revenue improvement was supported by modest client growth and price increases but was partially offset by the discount offered, unfavorable mix and lower contribution from the professional employer organization.Higher operating expenses resulted in an 80 basis points drop in operating margin to 45.5%.Regarding its fiscal 2013 guidance, Paychex seems a bit cautious. Given the current market and economic conditions, Paychex believes that checks per client will likely moderate through fiscal 2013. However, this will be partially offset by modest client growth and improved revenue per check. Also, Human Resources organic revenue growth will follow the historical trend.In the last 30 days, none out of the 20 estimates for the second quarter were revised. However, one of the 23 estimates for fiscal 2013 moved higher in the past 30 days. The limited movement, since Paychex's first quarter results, suggests a lack of driving events.However, some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on management's commentary regarding the sluggishness in new small-business formation. Moreover, a few analysts believe that aggressive pricing from  (  ) is stealing customers away from Paychex.The time between when the company receives payments from its clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating lower interest rates, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.However, some analysts are positive about Paychex's efforts to be technologically advanced by launching mobility apps for Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPad and Android tablets, which allows users to use the apps both on personal computers as well as laptops. In addition, Paychex launched smartphone applications targeting both employers and employees who are always on the move.There was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2013 in the past 30 days. However, the estimates moved down by a penny to 40 cents for the second quarter in the past 90 days. The estimate for fiscal 2013 remained unchanged at $1.61 in the past 90 days.Though the job markets have fared well in the month of November, industry experts believe that the trend is unlikely to continue. The unstable job market coupled with macro uncertainties could lead to a tough 2013 for Paychex.However, we believe that the company is prudent in making acquisitions that could support revenue growth in the coming quarters. Last week, Paychex acquired expense management business (""ExpenseWire"") of Rearden Commerce Inc. for an undisclosed sum. Expense Management is an integral part of Paychex's HR Services segment. Hence, we believe that the addition of new capabilities would attract professional employer organizations, thus generating revenue growth.Earlier this year, Paychex acquired online and PC-based time and attendance solutions provider, Icon Time Systems Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition has supported growth within Paychex's Payroll Service segment.The company's initiative for boosting revenue growth through acquisitions is encouraging. Also, the improving trend in small and medium business (SMB) IT spending could pave the way for Paychex in the coming quarters. However, low hiring in the SMB sector (leading to lower checks per client) and lack of new business wins has come in the way of solid revenue growth.We also remain concerned regarding stiff competition from Automatic Data Processing Inc. and  (  ).Currently, Paychex has a Zacks #4 Rank, (Sell), while both Intuit and ADP have Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Earnings Preview: Paychex Inc. - Analyst Blog@2012-12-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-paychex-inc.-analyst-blog-2012-12-17

 (  ) reported second-quarter fiscal 2013 earnings of 41 cents per share, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter's result was 4.9% above the year-ago level.Paychex reported second-quarter 2013 revenues of $569.4 million, up 4.3% from $545.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's revenue was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $574.0 million.Payroll Service segment revenue increased 1.4% year over year to $377.0 million. Client disruptions from Hurricane Sandy led to modest Payroll growth. Checks per payroll grew 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Human Resource Services segment generated $182.4 million in revenues, up 11.7% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was mainly attributable to client growth and price increases, partially offset by lower contribution from professional employer organization and unfavorable product mix.In the second quarter, Paychex incurred total expenses of $339.4 million, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses.Operating income was $230.0 million, up 5.6% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth supported by better cost management. Operating margin was 44.0% versus 43.9% in the year-ago quarter.Net income of $147.9 million in the reported quarter reflected a 5.3% increase from $140.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 41 cents compared with 39 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Paychex exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $122.6 million, down from $149.0 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments decreased 26.2% sequentially to $178.6 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 6.5% year over year to $10.0 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Keeping in view the current market and economic conditions, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate for fiscal 2013, which will be partially offset by modest client growth and improved revenue per check. Also, Human Resources organic revenue growth will follow the historical trend. Financial guidelines were maintained for fiscal 2013.For fiscal 2013, Paychex expects a 2-3% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 9.0% to 11.0%.Total service revenue will likely grow in the range of 5% to 6%. The company expects a 6-8% decline in interest on funds held for clients and 0-5% upside in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2013 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenue is estimated at 37.0% for fiscal 2013. The effective income tax rate is expected to be 36.0%. Net income is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%.Paychex' second quarter results were modest, with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missing the same. Fiscal 2013 guidance was disappointing reflecting macro uncertainties.We are encouraged by management's commentary regarding continued investments in product development and focus toward building sales force to support revenue growth.But lingering unemployment situation, strict interest rates and stiff competition from  (  ) and  (  ) keep us concerned. However, Paychex' zero European exposure will be beneficial for the company.Currently, Paychex has a Zacks # 3 Rank (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Posts Modest 2Q - Analyst Blog@2012-12-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-posts-modest-2q-analyst-blog-2012-12-20

While we are constructive on PAYX's business model and its strong FCF generation, we see downside risk to our estimates, given a lackluster environment for new business formation in the United States. With prospects for growth acceleration limited, and the shares trading at 19 times our FY2014E EPS, we prefer to move to the sidelines. … Shares of PAYX currently trade at a premium to the peer group average of 15 times.

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its first quarter 2013 results on November 15, 2012 and we see no movement in analyst estimates so far.Intuit reported fourth quarter 2012 loss per share of 8 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents loss per share.Revenue increased 13.6% from the year-ago quarter to $651.0 million. Reported revenue was within the company's guidance range. Revenue improved due to decent performances of all the segments barring the Financial Services segment, which posted a year-over-year decline.Lackluster revenue growth (due to seasonality) coupled with cost increases resulted in the operating loss.For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues in the range of $630.0 million to $640.0 million. GAAP operating loss is expected in the range of $85.0 million to $90.0 million. Non-GAAP operating loss is estimated to be in the $20.0 million to $25.0 million range. GAAP loss per share is projected at around 20 cents to 21 cents. The company also expects non-GAAP loss per share in the 6 cents to 7 cents range.Most of the analysts are of the opinion that Intuit will likely report as per its guidance. Though tax-related revenues will likely lack luster, analysts expect financial management and payroll segments to perform steadily. They also expect the small and medium business (SMB) segment to witness decent improvements stemming from good payroll business.All the 6 estimates for the first quarter were maintained over the last 7 days, reflecting a lack of potential catalysts. On the other hand, out of the 9 estimates available for fiscal 2013, 1 estimate moved upward.The magnitude of revisions has been minimal since the company reported its fourth quarter results. For the past 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter remained unchanged at 17 cents loss per share. But the estimate for fiscal 2013 inched up by a penny to $2.95. Over the last 90 days, estimates for the first quarter and fiscal 2013 dropped by a penny and 3 cents, respectively.Over the years, Intuit has posted losses in its fourth and first quarters due to seasonality. Its QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals revenues tend to be lowest during the fourth and first quarters. We believe that Intuit is set to report within its guided ranges.Another thing that needs to be kept in mind about Intuit is the growth/decline in employment in the small and medium business sector, which happens to be the growth driver of the company. The current situation in the SMB job market is not very encouraging and the numbers have declined since May (as per Intuit's Small Business Revenue and Employment Indexes).Intuit is also up against the leading payroll solution provider  (  ), which introduced certain tools to solve specific tax-credit-related problems for SMBs.But we believe that the acquisition of Demandforce in May will give enough support to boost the SMB business.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a Hold rating in the short-term (1-3 months).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Intuit Inc. - Analyst Blog@2012-11-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-intuit-inc.-analyst-blog-2012-11-13

That new target suggests a small 5% upside to the stock's Thursday closing price of $33.37.A Morgan Stanley analyst commented, ""We are positive on the payroll processing sector but see less upside for PAYX due to (1) weaker cycle to cycle earnings improvement, (2) less-attractive capital allocation, and (3) slow recovery for SMB clients coming out of the downturn.""Continuing, ""Our estimates are unchanged from our previous publishing but we increase our multiple from 19.5X as our organic growth analysis still shows nearly 20pp improvement over the previous employment cycle.""Paychex shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Friday.Shares of Paychex (  ) have a 3.84% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $33.37. The stock has technical support in the $31-$32 price area. If the shares can firm up, we see overhead resistance around the $35-$37 price levels. .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Morgan Stanley Raises Target for Paychex, but Still a “Neutral” (PAYX)@2012-10-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/morgan-stanley-raises-target-paychex-still-neutral-payx-2012-10-05

"here were certainly no signs of window dressing (money managers buying up the winners from the quarter to make their portfolios look better) in the indices as the selling continued this afternoon and right into the close.Looking at today's internals, we saw earnings results moving several names. Vail Mountain Resorts (  ) posted some nice gains following  . On the flipside, shares of Paychex (  ) and Emerson Electric (  ) pulled back on their earnings numbers and outlook. It wasn't a good day for Apple (  ) shares as disappointment from the initial iPhone5 weekend sales numbers continue to hang over the stock. Caterpillar (  ) shares were also lower as management pulled expectations lower for the next couple of years.There probably is no bigger controversy hitting the media headlines today than the brutal officiating call made in last night's Packers-Seahawks NFL football game by one of the increasingly despised replacement referees. The botched call by so called ""replacement"" referees handed the game to the Seahawks, when the correct call seemingly should've been an interception by the Packers.You see, The NFL has been in a negotiating battle over pensions for NFL referees. Amid the labor dispute, the league has locked out the regular refs (i.e. the people who know how to do the job correctly), replacing them with ill-prepared, inexperienced refs, many of whom have never refereed at a level higher than high school.Unfortunately the lack of experience has translated into an amazing amount of officiating mistakes, some of which are directly affecting the outcomes of games. Here we have a sport that makes hundreds of billions of dollars, and the difference between the what the ""real"" refs want and what the NFL is willing to give them reportedly boils down to less than $5 million. The longer the current situation goes on, the more irate players and fans will get. Clearly, this development is bad for the sport, and quite frankly, the NFL should know better.As I was driving into the Dividend.com offices this morning, it was amazing to hear the sports radio callers express their angst with what happened in last night's game. You could swear some of these callers were on the verge of having a heart attack with the anger they expressed. I couldn't help but think about how this type of scenario mirrors what happens with people and the financial/investment decisions they make. Many talk about building a large nest egg, but then the actions they take to get there make no sense at all. Whether it's trying make money trading in high-risk areas like penny stocks, Forex (currency trading), or futures, some of the same people blowing a gasket about the NFL referee situation should introspect and realize how they too are making a big blunder with their financial approach. In other cases, many people may be looking to all the wrong people for financial advice or guidance (similar to how the NFL thinks it can get away with unqualified referees).I can certainly say that sports brings out plenty of emotion for me. But at some point, you learn to separate the impact of sports on your actual life, and concentrate instead on things that matter so much more. If we can get the everyday person/sports fan to understand this concept, the scope of many people's financial well-being could certainly begin to get the proper attention it deserves.News came out this morning that office retail giant Staples (  ) is gearing up to close even more stores than the company had initially expected. Today is certainly a nerve-wracking day for commercial property owners who may have Staples as their key tenant (or ""anchor"") to their retail-focused location. Filling in these sort of locations once they are vacated often proves very difficult. For those who have much of their wealth tied up in commercial property these days, it's integral on top of property investments like never before. In the real estate business, it does pay to anticipate the changes that are likely coming, and create the fallback plan before this changes begin to occur.""Turn-key"" investments, particularly in real estate, are few and far between these days.

 (  ) reported first quarter 2013 earnings from continuing operations of 62 cents per share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 1.6% year over year due to lesser number of outstanding shares.Revenues increased 5.0% year over year to $2.64 billion, which slivered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63 billion. Organic growth was 3% in the quarter. The better-than-expected revenue was driven by strong new business sales expansion in the Employer Services and PEO Services segments.Employer Services revenue increased 6% year over year (5% organically) to $1.82 billion. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 3.3% in the quarter on a same-store-sales basis.PEO Services revenue expanded 13% year over year to $451.9 million in the reported quarter. Dealer Services revenue increased 9% year over year to $439.8 million.Interest on funds held for clients declined 12.4% year over year to $106.8 million. The decline was primarily due to a 60 basis points (bps) drop in the average interest yield to 2.7%, which was partially offset by a 6% increase in average client funds balances to $16.1 billion.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 5.3% year over year to $2.20 billion, attributable to higher operating expenses (up 6% year over year), selling, general & administrative expense (up 4.2% year over year) and systems development & programming costs (up 5.7% year over year).The company reported pre-tax earnings of $465.6 million, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. However, pre-tax margin decreased 50 bps year over year to 17.7%, due to a 60 bps fall in margins from Employer Services, which offset the 110 bps increase in PEO Services margin and 150 bps increase in Dealer Services margin.Net income from continuing operations increased 0.7% year over year to $302.5 million. Net margin decreased by 40 bps to 11.5% in the quarter.ADP exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term marketable securities) of $1.7 billion, compared with $1.58 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt decreased to $16.3 million in the quarter from $16.8 million in the prior quarter. ADP purchased 3.7 million shares for $215 million during the reported quarter.For fiscal 2013, ADP expects total revenue to increase in the range of 5.0%-7.0% year over year. Earnings are expected to increase 5.0%-7.0% over the year-ago level of $2.72 per share, excluding gains from the sale of assets.Employer Services revenue is expected to grow approximately 6%-7% with a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 50 bps. PEO Services revenue is forecasted to improve 13.0%-14.0%. Pre-tax margin is expected to grow slightly on a year-over-year basis. ADP expects Dealer Services revenue to increase in the 7.0%-9.0% range with a pre-tax margin expansion of at least 100 bps.The company expects interest on funds held for clients to decline $70 million-$75 million or 14%-15% from prior year to $420 to $425 million.We believe that ADP will continue to outperform the broader market based on strong new business sales, diversified product portfolio, improving customer retention, accretive acquisitions, strong balance sheet and shareholder-friendly programs (aggressive share buybacks, dividend) over the long term. However, increasing competition from  (  ) and a gloomy macroeconomic condition are the major headwinds in the near term.We have a Neutral recommendation on ADP over the long term.

aychex (  ) is set to report Q1 FY '13 earnings later today. It reported total revenues of $2.2 billion for fiscal year 2012, an increase of 7% from the $2.1 billion it had posted for FY 2011. During its last quarter, the company's operating income also increased approximately 7% to $196 million from $183 million the previous year. Because Paychex's revenues are dependent on the number of individuals employed across the US economy, we will be closely watching whether or not a weak job market has impacted the company's performance over the last three months.According to our model, the company's value consists of two divisions; Payroll Services and Human Resource Services. Both of these divisions are dependent on employment growth in the country, and the revenue per client is correlated with the number of employees that they have on their payrolls.One of the biggest drivers in the Payroll Services division, which is the average number of employees per payroll client and constitutes approximately 70% of the company's value. If the slow growth in the US job market has also dented employment growth within Paychex's client base during the quarter, we could see downside to our forecasts and consequently our price estimate. You can assess the impact that slower growth in US employment will have on Paychex's value by using our tool below.Paychex is focusing simplifying payroll processing services for small and medium businesses with SaaS-based mobile solutions such as Paychex Online mobile. While the employment picture remains bleak, it must innovate and simplify its platforms if it wants to have any chance at growing its client base. If it is successful on this front, the increase in the number of payroll clients could partially offset any downside impact due to a bleak employment picture. Therefore, we will also be closely monitoring any new product announcements that the company might make along with its earnings announcement.We currently have a  , which is approximately 4% below the current market price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Earnings Preview: What We're Watching@2012-09-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-earnings-preview-what-were-watching-2012-09-24

 (  ) reported first-quarter fiscal 2013 earnings of 42 cents per share, inching past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The quarter's result was 2.5% above the year-ago level. The company witnessed modest revenue improvement across its segments.Paychex reported first-quarter 2013 revenues of $578.2 million, up 2.7% from $563.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's revenue was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $584.0 million. However, improved client base and client retention rate were noticed during the quarter.Payroll Service segment revenue increased 0.9% year over year to $385.9 million. Checks per payroll grew 2.0% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue generated per issued check was impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting.Human Resource Services segment generated $182.2 million in revenues, up 7.4% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was mainly attributable to client growth and price increases, partially offset by lower contribution from professional employer organization and unfavorable product mix.In the first quarter, Paychex incurred total expenses of $340.2 million, up 2.0% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses.Operating income was $238.0 million, up 3.6% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth supported by better cost management. Operating margin was 45.5% versus 46.3% in the year-ago quarter.Net income of $153.1 million in the reported quarter reflected a 2.8% increase from $148.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 42 cents compared with 41 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Paychex exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $149.0 million, up from $108.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments increased 16.6% sequentially to $241.9 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 9.0% year over year to $10.1 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Keeping in view the current market and economic conditions, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate for fiscal 2013, which will be partially offset by modest client growth and improved revenue per check. Also, Human Resources organic revenue growth will follow the historical trend. Financial guidelines were maintained for fiscal 2013.For fiscal 2013, Paychex expects a 3-4% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 9.0% to 11.0%.Total service revenue will likely grow in the range of 5% to 6%. The company expects a 6-8% decline in interest on funds held for clients and 25-35% upside in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenue is estimated at 37.0% for fiscal 2013. The effective income tax rate is expected to be 36.0%. Net income is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%.Paychex' first quarter results were modest, with the bottom line barely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missing the same. Fiscal 2013 guidance was disappointing reflecting macro uncertainties.We are encouraged by management's commentary regarding continued investments in product development and focus toward building sales force to support revenue growth.But lingering unemployment situation, strict interest rates and stiff competition from  (  ) and  (  ) keep us concerned.

Financial Management Solutions revenue increased 20.0%, driven by higher subscription for QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Enterprise and contribution from recently acquired (May 2012) Demandforce. Employee Management Solutions revenue was up 12.0%, led by growth in Intuit Online Payroll subscribers. Payment Solutions revenue increased 21.0%, aided by customer growth for Intuit's GoPayment mobile payment solution.The Consumer Tax segment posted 12.2% revenue decline due to lower tax filings. Financial Services revenue was up 4.0% from the year-ago quarter, led by higher revenue in online and mobile banking. Accounting Professionals segment revenue increased 19.0%. Other Businesses revenue grew 5.0% on the back of Intuit's global business.Reported gross margin increased 90 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 71.9%. Operating margin in the quarter was (10.7%) versus (14.6%) in the year-ago quarter. Though total operating expenses increased 8.5%, the percentage on total revenue contracted.GAAP net loss from continuing operations was $51.0 million or 17 cents per share, compared with $58.0 million or 19 cents per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. The GAAP loss per share was wider than the company's guided range. Excluding one-time expenses but including stock-based compensation expenses, adjusted net loss in the quarter was $42.7 million or 14 cents per share versus $49.4 million or 16 cents in the year-ago quarter.Intuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of $558.0 million, down from $744.0 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $184.0 million compared with $183.0 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt remained flat sequentially at $499.0 million.Intuit used $145.0 million of operating cash in the first quarter, as against $182.0 million cash used in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure was $70.0 million. During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $100.0 million. The company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 17 cents per share valuing $50.0 million.For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.04 billion. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $130.0 million to $150.0 million. Non-GAAP operating income is estimated in the $190.0 million to $210.0 million range. GAAP EPS is projected in the range of 27 cents to 30 cents. The company also expects non-GAAP EPS in the 40 cents to 43 cents range.For fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues in the $4.55 billion to $4.65 billion range, representing growth of 10.0% to 12.0%. GAAP operating income is estimated between $1.315 billion and $1.345 billion, reflecting growth of 12.0% to 14.0%. Non-GAAP operating income is projected at $1.57-$1.60 billion, representing growth of 12.0% to 14.0%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to grow in the range of 6.0-8.0% to $2.76-$2.82. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected between $3.32 and $3.38, indicating a growth of 12.0% to 14.0%.Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered first quarter loss, which was expected given the fact that revenues from QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professional segments tend to be lowest during the period. But solid execution led the quarter's result to surpass Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line.We are encouraged by the second quarter guidance and we believe that the main driver would be the Small Business Group.We are positive on Intuit's growing SMB (small & medium business) exposure and believe that the closure of the Demandforce acquisition will provide further support to the segment. But stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider  (  ) in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing uncertainty in the economy concerns us.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intuit Posts 1Q Seasonal Loss - Analyst Blog@2012-11-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intuit-posts-1q-seasonal-loss-analyst-blog-2012-11-16

 (  ), specializing in payment processing services, is scheduled to announce its first quarter fiscal 2013 results on September 24 after the closing bell, and we notice limited movement in estimates at this point.Paychex delivered modest fourth quarter 2012 results, with earnings of 34 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The 3.6% increase from the year-ago quarter was on account of revenue improvement across all its segments, partially offset by low new business generation.Revenues grew 5.5% year over year, backed by increases of 11.5% in Human Resource Service revenue and 3.5% in Payroll Service revenue.Despite higher operating expenses, operating margin increased 70 basis points year over year owing to favorable mix.Paychex appeared to be a bit cautious as far as its fiscal 2013 guidance is concerned. Keeping in view the current market and economic condition, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2013. But this will be partially offset by modest client growth and improved revenue per check. Also, Human Resources organic revenue growth will follow the historical trend.Out of the 17 and 23 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter and fiscal 2013, respectively, we noticed absolutely no revision in the past 30 days. No estimate revisions were either noticed for fiscal 2014. The limited movement since Paychex reported fourth quarter results suggests that there is a lack of driving events.But some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on management's commentary regarding the sluggishness of new small-business formation. Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive pricing from  (  ) is stealing customers away from Paychex.The time difference between when the company receives payments from its clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating lower interest rates, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.However, some analysts are positive about Paychex's efforts to be technologically advanced by launching mobile apps for Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPad and Android tablets, which allows its users to use the apps whether they are using a personal computer or laptop. In addition, Paychex launched smartphone applications targeting both employers and employees who are always on the move.There was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2013 in the past 30 days. But the estimates moved down by 2 cents each to 41 cents and $1.61 for the first quarter and fiscal 2013, respectively in the past 90 days.

 (  ) reported a fourth quarter 2012 adjusted loss per share of 8 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 4 cents. Shares moved lower in after-hours trading reflecting the lackluster revenue and earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the coming quarter.Intuit reported revenues of $651.0 million in the fourth quarter, up 13.6% from $573.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Reported revenue was within management's guidance of $647.0 million to $662.0 million.Product revenues increased 2.6% year over year to $240.0 million, while Services and Other revenues climbed 21.2% from the prior-year quarter to $411.0 million.Segment-wise, the Small Business Group posted a 19.0% year-over-year growth based on the strength of its sub-segments. Revenue for Financial Management Solutions increased 17.0%, driven by higher subscription for QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Enterprise. Employee Management Solutions revenue was up 13.0%, led by growth in Intuit Online Payroll and Enhanced Payroll subscribers, as well as improved adoption of direct deposit services. Online payroll subscribers grew 19.0%. Payment Solutions revenue increased 31.0%, with 13.0% growth in merchant customers.The Consumer Tax segment posted 16.0% revenue growth. Financial Services revenue was slightly down from the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the Accounting Professionals segment increased 8.0%. Other Businesses revenue grew 5.0% on the back of Intuit's global business.Reported gross margin fell 160 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 70.7%. Operating margin was (6.9%) versus (10.0%) in the year-ago quarter. Though total operating expenses increased 7.0%, the percentage on total revenue contracted.GAAP net loss was $32.0 million or 11 cents per share, compared with $56.0 million or 19 cents per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time expenses but including stock-based compensation expenses, the adjusted net loss in the quarter was $22.6 million or 8 cents per share versus $24.3 million or 8 cents in the year-ago quarter.Intuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of $744.0 million, down from $1.52 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $183.0 million compared with $294.0 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt remained flat sequentially at $499.0 million.Intuit used $182.0 million of operating cash in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditure was $61.0 million. During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $107.0 million and paid off $178.0 million in dividend. The company also announced a 13.0% increment in quarterly cash dividend. The increased dividend of 17 cents per share will be paid effective October 2012.For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues in the range of $630.0 million to $640.0 million. GAAP operating loss is expected at $85.0 million to $90.0 million. Non-GAAP operating loss is estimated in the $20.0 million to $25.0 million range.

The company also expects non-GAAP loss per share in the 6 cents to 7 cents range.For fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues between $4.55 billion and $4.65 billion, representing growth of 10.0% to 12.0%. GAAP operating income is estimated between $1.315 billion and $1.345 billion, reflecting growth of 12.0% to 14.0%. Non-GAAP operating income is projected to grow 12.0% to 14.0%.

Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected between $3.32 and $3.38, indicating a growth of 12.0% to 14.0%.Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered disappointing fourth quarter results, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line. We are also concerned about first quarter 2013 guidance.However, we are positive on Intuit's growing SMB (small & medium business) exposure and believe that the closure of the Demandforce acquisition will provide further support to the segment. But stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider  (  ) in the SMB arena, seasonality of Intuit's tax business and ongoing uncertainty in the economy concerns us.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term Sell rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intuit's 4Q Loss Wider Than Expected - Analyst Blog@2012-08-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intuits-4q-loss-wider-than-expected-analyst-blog-2012-08-22

We downgrade both to Underperform from Hold, as we believe employment markets remain challenged, the interest rate environment will be a lingering headwind, and remaining secular tailwind is quite limited.

ayroll and human resources services provider Paychex, Inc. (  ) late Monday posted mixed fiscal first quarter earnings, as profit narrowly edged analysts' view but revenue fell short of expectations.The Rochester, NY-based company reported fiscal first quarter net income of $153.1 million, or 42 cents per share, compared with $148.9 million, or 41 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Revenue rose 3% from last year to $578.2 million.On average, Wall Street analysts expected a slightly smaller profit of 41 cents per share, albeit on higher revenue of $584.3 million.Looking ahead, PAYX said it still expects implied full-year 2013 earnings to range from about $575.4 million to $586.4 million, while analysts are looking for $581.3 million in profit for the year.Paychex shares fell $1.28, or -3.7%, in premarket trading Tuesday.Shares of Paychex (  ) have a 3.72% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $34.38.

 (  ) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings of 34 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter's result was 3.6% above the year-ago level. The company witnessed revenue improvement across its segments but was lackluster regarding new business creation.Paychex reported fourth-quarter 2012 revenues of $551.5 million, up 5.5% from $522.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The quarter's revenue was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $558.0 million.Payroll Service segment revenue increased 3.5% year over year to $369.5 million. Excluding the contribution from SurePayroll, Payroll service revenue growth was 3.0%, mainly attributable to the increase in checks per payroll and a modest rise in revenue per check. Revenue generated per issued check was impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting.Human Resource Services segment generated $171.2 million in revenues, up 11.5% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was partly based on the contribution from ePlan Services. Excluding ePlan, the segment revenue growth for the fourth quarter stood at 9.0%, reflecting client growth and price increases.In the fourth quarter, Paychex incurred total expense of $355.6 million, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses.Operating income was $195.9 million, up 7.2% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth and better cost management. Operating margin was 37.5% versus 36.8% in the year-ago quarter.Net income of $123.3 million in the reported quarter reflected a 3.7% increase from $118.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 34 cents compared with 33 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Paychex exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $108.8 million, down from $146.5 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments decreased $149.3 million sequentially to $207.5 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 12.2% year over year to $10.8 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Keeping in view the current market and economic conditions, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate for fiscal 2013, which will be partially offset by modest client growth and improved revenue per check. Also, Human Resources organic revenue growth will follow the historical trend.For fiscal 2013, Paychex expects a 3-4% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 9.0% to 11.0%.Total service revenue will likely grow in the range of 5% to 6%. The company expects a 6-8% decline in interest on funds held for clients and 25-35% upside in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income as a percentage of service revenue is expected at 37.0%% for fiscal 2013. The effective income tax rate is expected to be 36.0%. Net income is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%.Paychex' fourth quarter results were mediocre, with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missing. Fiscal 2013 guidance was disappointing reflecting macro uncertainties. But management's commentary regarding continued investments in product development was a positive.Despite new business wins in the SMB sector, stiff competition from  (  ) and  (  ), and an uncertain unemployment situation will remain constant worries. However, Paychex's zero European exposure will be helpful.Paychex has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Posts Modest 4Q - Analyst Blog@2012-06-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-posts-modest-4q-analyst-blog-2012-06-29

If the shares can firm up, we see overhead resistance around the $34-$36 price levels. .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Q4 Profit In-Line with Estimates; Revenue Misses (PAYX)@2012-06-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-q4-profit-line-estimates-revenue-misses-payx-2012-06-27
 (  ) reported fourth quarter 2012 earnings of 53 cents per share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 10.4% year over year primarily due to strong revenue growth.Revenues increased 5.2% year over year to $2.64 billion, which marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.65 billion. Organic growth was 4.0% in the quarter. The better-than-expected revenue was driven by strong new business sales and better sales execution in the Employer Services and PEO Services segments.Employer Services revenue increased 7.0% year over year (5.0% organically) to $1.88 billion. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 3.2% in the quarter on a same-store-sales basis.PEO Services revenue expanded 12.0% year over year to $443.3 million in the reported quarter. Dealer Services revenue climbed 7.0% year over year to $431.4 million.Interest on funds held for clients declined 11.3% year over year to $120.3 million, due to a decline of 40 basis points (bps) in the average interest yield to 2.5%, partially offset by a 4.0% increase in average client funds balances to $19.2 billion.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 4.0% year over year to $2.27 billion, attributable to higher operating expenses (up 4.2% year over year), selling, general & administrative expense (up 2.6% year over year) and systems development & programming costs (up 8.0% year over year).The company reported pre-tax earnings of $397.5 million, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Pre-tax margin increased 80 bps year over year to 15.1%, driven by higher Employer Services' pre-tax margin, PEO Services pre-tax margin and Dealer Services pre-tax margin, which increased 40 bps, 130 bps and 70 bps, respectively, in the reported quarter.Net income increased 6.9% year over year to $258.4 million. Net margin increased by 20 bps to 9.8% in the quarter.ADP exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents (including short-term marketable securities) of $1.59 billion, compared with $1.69 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt decreased to $16.8 million in the quarter from $17.3 million in the prior quarter. ADP purchased 6.4 million shares for $342.0 million during the reported quarter.For fiscal 2013, ADP expects total revenue to increase in the range of 5.0%-7.0% year over year. This includes unfavorable foreign exchange rates, expected decline in interest on client funds and year-over-year comparisons relating to sale of assets and expiration of certain employment tax credits. For fiscal 2013, earnings are expected to increase 5.0%-7.0% over the year-ago level of $2.74 per share.Employer Services revenue is expected to grow approximately 6%-7% with a pre-tax margin expansion of approximately 50bps. PEO Services revenue is forecasted to improve 13.0%-15.0%. Pre-tax margin is expected to grow slightly on a year-over-year basis. ADP expects Dealer Services revenue to increase in the 7.0%-9.0% range with a pre-tax margin expansion of at least 50 bps.The company expects interest on funds held for clients to decline $65.0 million-$75.0 million or 13.0%-15.0% from $493.3 million in fiscal 2012. However, the company expects 5%-7% increase in the average client fund balances.We believe that ADP will continue to outperform the broader market based on strong new business sales, diversified product portfolio, improving customer retention, accretive acquisitions, strong balance sheet and shareholder-friendly programs (aggressive share buybacks, dividend) over the long term. However, increasing competition from  and a gloomy macroeconomic condition are the major headwinds in the near term.We have a Neutral recommendation on ADP over the long term.

 (  ) has recently signed an agreement with US-based multi-million dollar direct selling company - Team National, to provide the latter with its payroll, compliance and benefits solutions.ADP will manage the payroll and tax functions related to Team National's 350,000 members and will also take care of other administrative aspects of its human resource management. The solutions provided by ADP also mitigate the business risk by providing better compliance and innovative techniques to manage human resource issues.Apart from strategic partnerships that would be incrementally beneficial for the company to grow organically, ADP's growth in recent years has been largely attributable to accretive acquisitions, for which it has spent approximately $776 million in 2011 itself. The acquisitions have bolstered ADP's human resources business process outsourcing portfolio and complemented the existing applicant tracking and talent management solutions, thereby boosting ADP's customer base and top-line growth going forward.In the recently concluded quarter, ADP's top line was driven by strong sales from new clients, improving client retention and incremental revenue from recent acquisitions.Employer Services revenue increased 7.0% year over year (6.0% organically) to $2.11 billion. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 3.3% in the quarter on a same-store-sales basis. Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services revenue jumped 15.0% year over year to $513.7 million in the third quarter. Dealer Services revenue climbed 7.0% year over year to $431.9 million.Moreover, the company expects its Employer Services revenue and PEO Services revenue to increase by 7% and 17% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.This lends support to our assumption that ADP will continue to outperform the broader market based on strong new business sales, a diversified product portfolio, improving customer retention, accretive acquisitions, strong balance sheet and shareholder-friendly programs (aggressive share buybacks, dividend) over the long term.However, we cannot discount the increasing competition from  (  ) and a gloomy macro outlook in Europe, which are the near-term headwinds for the company.We have a Neutral recommendation on ADP over the long term.

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter fiscal 2012 results on June 28 after the closing bell, and we notice limited upward movement in estimates at this point.Paychex delivered modest third quarter 2012 results, with earnings of 37 cents per share matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The 2.8% increase from the year-ago quarter was on account of revenue improvement across all its segments.Revenues grew 7.2% year over year, backed by increases of 12.3% in Human Resource Service revenue and 5.5% in Payroll Service revenue.Higher operating expenses resulted in operating margin contraction of 50 basis points year over year.Paychex seemed a bit cautious about the fiscal 2012 guidance. Keeping in view the current market and economic condition, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012.Out of the 21 analysts providing estimates for the fourth quarter, we noticed absolutely no revision. Of the 23 estimates for fiscal 2012, only one went up in the last 30 days.The limited movement since Paychex reported third quarter results suggests that there is a lack of driving events.But some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on management's commentary regarding the sluggishness of new small-business formation. Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive pricing from  (  ) is stealing customers away from Paychex.The time difference between when the company receives payments from its clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating lower interest rates, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.There was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter in the past 90 days. But the estimate for fiscal 2012 moved forward by a penny to $1.52 in the past 30 days. The estimate for fiscal 2013 remained unaltered at $1.63.The market is losing confidence on the growth of the SMB group. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand that comes on the heels of high unemployment and inflation rates. Outsourcing companies like Paychex are highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason why it may not see much revenue growth.However, we are encouraged by management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and synergies from the recent acquisition of Icon Time Systems in January 2012. In this environment, we believe that cost control will play an important role for Paychex.Despite new business wins in the SMB sector, stiff competition from Automated Data Processing and  (  ), and an uncertain unemployment situation will remain constant worries. However, Paychex' zero European exposure will be benefit.Paychex has a Zacks # 3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Paychex Inc. - Analyst Blog@2012-06-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-paychex-inc.-analyst-blog-2012-06-26
 (  ) reported third quarter 2012 adjusted earnings of $2.43 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.39. Despite the earnings beat, shares fell 1.25% in the day's trade and 0.11% after hours. The share price indicates investor concern due to lowering of fiscal 2012 revenue and EPS guidance.Intuit reported revenues of $1.95 billion in the third quarter, up 5.2% from $1.85 billion in the prior-year quarter. Reported revenue was in line with the lower end of management's guidance range of $1.95 billion to $1.99 billion and slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96 billion.Product revenues decreased 0.7% year over year to $598.0 million, while Services and Other revenues climbed 8.1% from the prior-year quarter to $1.35 billion.Segment-wise, Small Business Group posted an 11.0% year-over-year growth based on the strength of the group's sub-segments. Financial Management Solutions' revenue increased 8.0%, driven by higher subscription for QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Enterprise. Employee Management Solutions revenue was up 12.0%, led by growth in Intuit Online Payroll and Enhanced Payroll subscribers and improved adoption of direct deposit services. Online payroll subscribers grew 19.0%. Payment Solutions revenue increased 14.0%, with 13.0% growth in merchant customers.Performance of Consumer Tax segment was weak with a 3.0% revenue growth. The lackluster growth was mainly due to lower tax filings with the IRS () and slow improvement in digital tax filing category, partially offset by better revenue per client.The Financial Services revenue increased 2.0% driven by the growing popularity of Intuit's online and mobile solutions. Accounting Professionals segment revenue increased 5.0%. Other Businesses revenue grew 6.0% on the back of Intuit's global business.Reported gross margin fell 130 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 89.6%. The margin contraction was mainly due to the Consumer Tax segment, partially offset by some cost minimization efforts.Operating margin in the quarter fell 50 bps year over year to 56.9%. Though total operating expenses increased 2.7%, the percentage on total revenue contracted.GAAP net income was $734.0 million or $2.42 per share, compared with $688.0 million or $2.20 per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. Excluding amortization expenses but including stock-based compensation expenses, the adjusted net income in the quarter was $735.4 million or $2.43 per share versus $699.1 million or $2.23 in the year-ago quarter.Intuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of $1.52 billion, up from $959.0 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $294.0 million compared with $592.0 million in the previous quarter. As of April 30, 2011, long-term debt was $499.0 million, down from $999.0 million in the prior quarter.Intuit had $1.28 billion of operating cash in the third quarter versus $260.0 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure was $33.0 million. During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $207.0 million and paid off $500.0 million of debt and $45.0 million in dividend.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the company expects revenues in the range of $647 million to $662.0 million. GAAP operating loss is expected in the range of $25.0 million to $15.0 million. Non-GAAP operating income is estimated in the $30.0 million to $40.0 million range. GAAP loss per share is projected in the range of 7 cents to 5 cents. The company also expects non-GAAP diluted EPS in the 5 cents to 7 cents range.For fiscal 2012, the company expects revenues in the $4.205 billion to $4.220 billion range (previously $4.185 billion to $4.285 billion), representing growth of 9.0% to 10.0%. GAAP operating income is estimated between $1.180 billion and $1.190 billion (previously $1.190-$1.215 billion), reflecting growth of 17% to 18%. Non-GAAP operating income is projected at $1.400-$1.410 billion (previously $1.405-$1.430 billion), representing growth of 12.0% to 13.0%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to grow in the range of 22.0-25.0% to $2.44-$2.49 (previously $2.43 to $2.50). Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected between $2.92 and $2.97 (previously $2.90 to $2.97), indicating a growth of 16.0% to 18.0%.Management also mentioned at the conference call that Intuit's fiscal 2012 earnings could slightly be diluted for the acquisition of Demandforce, earlier this month. But at the same time, it mentioned that the additional unit will add modestly to fiscal 2013 earnings.Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered modest third quarter results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates on the bottom line but missing the same on the top line. We are concerned about fiscal 2012 guidance lowering.But we believe that there is ample scope for the increase of Intuit's SMB exposure. Intuit recorded 11.0% year-over-year revenue growth in its SMB group in its second quarter 2012 results, and expects to witness healthy year-over-year growth of 10.0-12.0% in fiscal 2012. The acquisition of Demandforce is a perfect fit for Intuit's SMB business segment. Upon closure, Demandforce will be included as a new sub-segment in Intuit's SMB Group.However, we remain concerned due to the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and ongoing uncertainty in the economy at large. Moreover, we think that Intuit is going to face stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider  (  ) in the SMB (small and medium business) sector as the latter introduced certain tools that aim at solving certain tax credit related problems for SMBs.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term Sell rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intuit Beats EPS, Shares Topple - Analyst Blog@2012-05-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intuit-beats-eps-shares-topple-analyst-blog-2012-05-18
"In my previous articles on  , I told you about  and  , which  electrical-power solutions for consumers and industry.Today, I want to draw your attention to a company that serves as an essential ""behind-the-scenes administrator"" -- cutting checks, managingaccounting services and overseeingdirect deposit transfers -- for employees at corporations across the United States, as well as overseas.This New Jersey-based firm began in 1949 as a manual payroll processor. Focused on increasing efficiency for its customers, its business evolved from punch cards to automated paycheck printing. Today, this company issues paychecks to about one out of every six Americans. I'm talking about  .This business success translates into steady and regular dividend increases. ADP currently distributes $0.395 per quarter or $1.58 annually. At the stock's current price -- near $54 -- this works out to a forward  of almost 3%. And more important: The company has consistently increased its dividend every year since 1974. In 2009, for example, the company paid out $1.33 in dividends. In 2010, it paid 3.7% more -- $1.38 per share; and in 2011, dividend payments reached $1.48 per share. By 2012, dividends should be at least $1.58, another jump of 7.1% from 2011.-- Dr. Melvin Pasternak Steady  growth backs the company's regular dividend increases. Despite weakness in the U.S.  -- which means fewer corporations needing to issue paychecks to their employees -- ADP has maintained its strong customer base. Client retention is at a historical high, according to ADP  Carlos Rodriguez. In addition, revenue and profits are expected to expand during the coming year.That's because ADP is focusing on diversifying its service offerings. Besides providing payroll administration services, the company now also helps corporations with many facets of human resources, including hiring, managing compensation and benefits packages and overseeing retirement planning. ADP also provides a multitude of business solutions for vehicle dealers.Expanding its traditional markets is an important aspect of the company's growth strategy. Traditionally, ADP focused on serving large corporations. It's now taking on rival  in attempt to dominate human resources and payroll services in small- and medium-sized businesses, too. The strategy appears to be working.From a technical perspective, ADP looks strong.As the below chart shows,  have been climbing for the past two years. In the process, a  line formed.-- Dr. Melvin PasternakCurrently, the stock is at about its so-called ""  ,"" trading at roughly $54 a share. As long as this support level is maintained, the stock is likely to continue moving higher over time. Also, because the shares are at a multi-month low, now may be a potentially attractive time to purchase the stock.Resistance -- the opposite of support and the price at which a stock is unlikely to exceed -- which is about $56.70, the two-year high reached in early 2012. Shares could easily retest this high, marking at least a 5% gain. But if resistance were broken, then the stock should could potentially move higher.This  technical outlook is backed by strong fundamentals.No end in sight for rising revenueADP's revenue has increased every year since 2003. In early May, the company reported upbeat fiscal third-quarter results. Due to new business sales across several payroll service areas, revenue for the period increased 7% year-over-year, reaching $2.9 billion.With U.S. unemployment rates expected to decrease in the coming months, the number of employees on ADP's payroll processing plans is also likely to grow. As such, management anticipates full-year 2012 revenue to rise 7-9% to at least $10.6 billion -- up from $9.9 billion in 2011. For full-year 2013, analysts expect revenue to increase a further 8% to $11.5 billion.The earnings outlook is equally strong.In the most recently reported third-quarter, earnings rose 8% to $0.92, from $0.85 in the year-earlier period.With an expected increase in demand for ADP's business services, the company projects full-year 2012 earnings will rise 8-9% to the range of $2.72-$2.75 per share. (In 2011, it stood at $2.52 per share.) By full-year 2013, analysts project earnings could increase at least another 10%, to $3.01 per share. This earnings increase should translate into regular dividend increases over time.In addition to a strong fundamental outlook, the company currently has $1.7 billion in cash. With more than $6 billion in equity and only $17.3 million in debt, it has an outstandingdebt-to-market-capitalization ratio of less than 1%, making its  rock solid. Even during a soft economic environment, ADP has managed to grow its revenues and earnings -- and reward shareholders through regular dividend increases. By expanding its service offerings and product portfolio, the company has maintained its stronghold in the payroll services industry. The stock is suitable for retired investors who want regular and increasing dividends for some time to come.Melvin Pasternak does not personally hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

ell recognized for its products such as TurboTax and Quicken, financial and tax preparation software provider  (  ) has opted to buy a San Francisco-based company called Demandforce. The $423.5 million deal is expected to close this month.Founded in 2003, Demandforce provides software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications for marketing and customer relationship management. Its products are primarily tailored for small and medium businesses (SMBs). The company's products are generally used in dental offices, auto repair shops, spas and salons, and optometry. The software also helps the SMBs have real-time interactions with customers through Facebook and Twitter.The acquisition will be a perfect fit for Intuit's SMB business segment. Upon closure, Demandforce will be included as a new sub-segment in Intuit's SMB Group. The new division will be headed by Demandforce's current president and founder, Rick Berry. As of now, the group consists of three sub-segments namely Financial Management Solutions, Employee Management Solutions and Payment Solutions.The new unit will help Intuit in cross-selling and up-selling its products to existing customers, leading to faster product adoption. With its capabilities, Demandforce is expected to add 1-2% to revenue growth in FY13 and have a neutral to slightly dilutive effect on non-GAAP earnings for fiscal 2012 and 2013.We believe that there is ample scope for the increase of Intuit's SMB exposure. Intuit recorded 9.0% year-over-year revenue growth in its SMB group in its second quarter 2012 results, and expects to witness healthy year-over-year growth of 10.0-12.0% in fiscal 2012.But we remain somewhat concerned about the prevailing macro uncertainty in the U.S., which could be a drag on SMB revenue.Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered impressive second quarter results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Though revenue expectation for the upcoming quarter was kept unchanged, the company raised its operating margin and EPS guidance.But we think that Intuit is going to face stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider  (  ), which introduced certain tools that aim to solve certain tax-credit-related problems for SMBs.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term Sell rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intuit Buys Demandforce, Boosts SMB - Analyst Blog@2012-05-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intuit-buys-demandforce-boosts-smb-analyst-blog-2012-05-02
 (  ) is set to announce its fiscal third quarter 2012 results before the opening bell on Tuesday, May 1, 2012. In the run up to the earnings results, no substantial movement in analysts' estimates for the quarter was noticed.Both of ADP's top and bottom lines came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter of 2012. Quarterly revenues increased 7.4% on a year-over-year basis to $2.58 billion, primarily due to strong new business sales, improving client retention and incremental revenue from recent acquisitions.Earnings per share (  ) increased 9.7% year over year on the back of strong revenue growth.For further details please read: For fiscal 2012, ADP expects total revenue to increase in the range of 7.0%-9.0%. EPS is expected to increase 8%-9% over $2.52 reported in year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 is pegged at $2.74 per share.Employer Services is expected to grow approximately 7% and pre-tax margins to expand 30 bps. The company expects pays per control to increase approximately 2.5% (prior outlook 2.0%) for fiscal 2012.PEO Services revenue is forecasted to improve 17.0%. Pre-tax margin is expected to improve slightly on a year-over-year basis. ADP expects Dealer Services revenue to increase in the 9.0%-10.0% range (prior forecast 8%-9%) with a pre-tax margin expansion of at least 50 bps.The company expects interest on funds held for clients to decline by $45.0 million to $55.0 million or 8%-10% from $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. However, the company expects 6%-7% increase in the average client fund balances.Over the past 30 days, only one out of the 20 analysts covering the stock revised the estimate downward, while no upward revision was noticed for the quarter. With only one downward revision, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pinned at 91 cents per share.For fiscal 2012, none of the 24 analysts covering the stock revised any estimate in the last 30 days. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 is pinned at $2.74 per share.The analysts covering the stock opine that ADP will likely post in line results on the back of improvement in the employment market coupled with growth in the new business sales and strategic acquisitions to pave way for top-line growth in the forthcoming quarters.We note that ADP's earning has always matched the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the past four quarters and for the current quarter we expect the phenomenon to continue.ADP is expected to report an in line third quarter backed by new business sales, diversified product portfolio, improving customer retention, accretive acquisitions, strong balance sheet and shareholder-friendly programs (aggressive share buybacks, dividend) over the long term.However, increasing competition from  (  ) and  (  ) and a gloomy macroeconomic outlook in the Europe are major headwinds in the near term. Additionally, higher-than-expected unemployment rates and low interest rates remain concerns for the company's payroll processing business.We have a Neutral recommendation on ADP over the long term.

 (  ) reported third-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings of 37 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents. The company witnessed revenue improvement across all its segments and displayed a good operating performance.Paychex reported third-quarter 2012 revenues of $569.5 million, up 7.2% from $531.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year upside can be attributed to growth in Payroll service revenue and Human Resource service revenue. revenue increased 5.5% year over year to $386.5 million. Excluding the contribution from SurePayroll, Payroll service revenue growth was 4.0%, mainly attributable to the increase in checks per payroll and a modest rise in revenue per check. Revenue generated per issued check was impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting. segment generated $172.0 million in revenues, up 12.3% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was partly based on the contribution from ePlan Services. Excluding ePlan, the segment revenue growth for the third quarter stood at 10%, reflecting client growth and price increases.In the third quarter, Paychex incurred total expense of $359.1 million, up 8.0% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses.Operating income was $210.4 million, up 5.8% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth and better cost management. Operating margin was 36.9% versus 37.4% in the year-ago quarter.Net income of $135.4 million in the reported quarter reflected a 3.7% increase from $130.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 37 cents compared with 36 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Paychex exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $146.5 million, down from $96.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments decreased $41.0 million sequentially to $356.8 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 7.0% year over year to $11.0 million, as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partly offset by a 7% increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Keeping in view the current market and economic conditions, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate for the remainder of fiscal 2012, thereby impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human Resource Services revenues.Moreover, Paychex reaffirmed its full-year guidance.For fiscal 2012, Paychex expects a 5-7% increase in Payroll Service revenues compared with the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 12.0% to 15.0%.Total service revenue will likely grow in the range of 7% to 9%. The company expects a 12-14% decline in interest on funds held for clients and a roughly 2% upside in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to persist, thus increasing investment income.Net operating income is expected in the range of 36% to 37% for fiscal 2012.

 recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of the human resource subsidiary of SHPS. However, the terms of the deal were not disclosed. The recent takeover marks ADP's third acquisition in the last four months of 2012.Louisville, Kentucky-based SHPS offers employee benefit programs and benefit administration services. This is not the first acquisition of its kind, as even last year ADP acquired privately held Asparity Decision Solutions, a well known provider of employee benefit solutions. The acquisitions are in fact reflective of ADP's decision to expand its portfolio in the benefit administration segment.The ongoing health care reforms and complex regulations related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) has complicated benefit administration of many companies. Employees are also facing increasing difficulties in selecting the appropriate benefit plan for themselves and their families that could maximize their take-home salary and simultaneously reduce the cost-burden on their employers.SPHS Human Resource Solutions are a strategic fit for ADP, as they not only expand the company's benefits portfolio but also enhance its exposure to new areas of absence management and reimbursement solutions. We believe that the addition of SPHS human resource subsidiary will boost ADP's clientele growth going forward.As such ADP's growth in recent years has been largely driven by accretive acquisitions, for which it has spent approximately $776 million in 2011 itself. If the latest acquisitions are anything to go by, then the company clearly intends to tread the same path in 2012.In February, the company acquired privately held PhyLogic Healthcare LLC, a well-known provider of revenue cycle management (RCM) and medical billing outsourcing services. The acquisition was made to augment ADP's position in the rapidly growing U.S. RCM market. According to ST Advisors, LLC, the RCM market is expected to grow from approximately $4 billion in 2010 to more than $9 billion by 2018, driven by the upcoming medical reimbursement regulation changes.In early January, ADP entered the lucrative Indian market with the acquisition of Ma Foi Consulting Solutions Ltd, an Indian human resource and payroll management company. The acquisition should be beneficial for the company as it will facilitate further expansion in developing markets. Through this acquisition, ADP will gain access to the growing market of human resource business process outsourcing (HR BPO) in India.We believe that the back-to-back acquisitions will drive top-line growth for fiscal 2012 and beyond. The acquisitions are expected to diversify ADP's revenue base, which in turn will help the company to outperform the market, in our view.However, increasing competition from  and  and a gloomy macro outlook in North America and Europe are major headwinds over the near term. Additionally, higher unemployment rates and low interest rates remain concerns for the company's payroll processing business.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on the stock over the long term (6-12 months).

"he S&P 500 is up 11% year-to-date. But there is another rally that is getting less attention: U.S. Treasury yields have been on the rise.Short-term Treasury yields have inched up throughout 2012, while longer-term  have bumped up only in recent weeks.-- Amy Calistri Of course, interest rates are still well below where they were before the financial crisis. At the start of 2008, the 10-year Treasury  was 3.9%, compared with 2.25% today.Interest rates have been on a downward slide for nearly five years. The most significant descent started in 2008 when the Federal Reserve cut the  to effectively zero. In fact, rates have been low for such a long time, borrowers have gotten a bit complacent.There has been little urgency to borrow at low rates because, up until now, there has been no penalty for waiting. To some extent, a little bump in rates might do more good than harm to the  . For example, the threat of even slightly higher  rates might do a lot to get potential home buyers off the sidelines. Likewise, corporations might decide to borrow more now, locking in low rates before they rise.Of course, the rise in rates may be a short-term phenomenon. Hedge-fund managers, however, are betting that it is the start of a bona fide trend. Believing yields might go even higher, hedge funds and other large investors sold 78% of their holdings of two-year Treasury  the week ended March 13, according to a Bank of America/Merrill Lynch report. The same report noted that big money managers tripled their short positions against 10-year Treasuries.I'll be keeping a close eye on this potential trend. But if rates continue to trend higher as they have in the past few weeks, a few companies will be winners...Banks: Banks will still be able to borrow money at rock-bottom rates, but may be able to issue new home, consumer, and corporate loans at higher rates. In my February issue of  , I profiled  , a regional bank that may be a beneficiary.Floating rate securities: The interest rate for floating rate -- or adjustable rate -- debt is determined by short-term lending rates. A rise in short-term rates generates more income for floating rate securities.Floating rate funds like  should benefit if short-term interest rates continue to creep up. Since the bottom of the sell-off in October of last year, this fund's price is up 18% -- a strong move for a steady  yielding almost 7%.Savings accounts and employment services companies: If you have money in a  , then you've probably noticed that it is yielding just a little bit more than if you had stuck it under your mattress. If this interest rate trend takes hold, then you might see a tiny bit more yield from your savings account. But for employment companies such as  , a little incremental yield goes a long way.Paychex makes interest income on the money it holds for its clients until the money is used to pay employees, fund retirement accounts and so forth. If the employment situation continues to improve and interest rates rise, then that's a double bonus for employment services companies.Risks to Consider: Specifically, callable  are being called frequently as companies redeem the bonds to issue cheaper debt before rates rise. And mortgage  investment trusts (REITs) like  are facing headwinds too. In the short term, higher mortgage rates will likely trigger a new wave of mortgage  (to take advantage before rates rise too far), which will be a drag on their business. It is still too early to say whether this recent lift in interest rates is a trend or a flash in the pan. Surprisingly bad economic news out of China or another debt emergency in Europe could cause investors to find their way back to the relative safety of Treasuries -- driving the yields back down. But I always want you to be prepared for any change in the  . And this is something I'm going to continue to focus on.Disclosure: Neither Amy Calistri nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold

The quarter's results indicate slow recovery in the small and medium business (  ) sector due to deceleration in high unemployment and inflation rates.Paychex' second quarter revenues grew 6.6% year over year, backed by increases of 12.5% in Human Resource Service revenue and 4.8% in Payroll Service revenue.A modest revenue growth and better cost management led to operating margin expansion of 640 basis points year over year. Nevertheless, Paychex seemed a bit cautious about the fiscal 2012 guidance.Keeping in view the current market and economic condition, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human Resource Service revenues.Moreover, Paychex believes that the favorability in expenses realized in the second quarter may not be realized throughout fiscal 2012 due to the planned investments in its business.For more details of second quarter earnings, please visit:  .Out of the 20 and 23 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively, none made any revision in the last 30 days. Also, no change was noticed in the estimates provided for fiscal 2013.But some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on management's commentary regarding the sluggishness in new small-business formation. Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive pricing from  (  ) is stealing customers away from Paychex.The time difference between when the company receives payments from its clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating lower interest rates, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.There was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter or fiscal 2012 over the past 30 days. We also see that there was no change in estimates over the past 90 days, implying that analysts have stuck to their estimates post second quarter results.The market is losing confidence on the growth of the SMB group. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand that comes on the heels of high unemployment and inflation rates. Outsourcing companies like Paychex are highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason why it may not see much revenue growth.However, we are encouraged by management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and synergies from the recent acquisition. We also believe that cost control will play an important role for Paychex, going forward.Though new business wins in the SMB sector, and stiff competition from ADP and  (  ) will remain a constant worry, we believe that Paychex can benefit from the improvement in the U.S. employment situation. Hence, considering the situation and keeping in mind Paychex' consistency in delivering impressive results and zero European exposure, we expect a constructive quarter ahead.Paychex has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Paychex Inc.

 (  ) reported second quarter 2012 adjusted earnings of 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. Shares increased 3.44% in the after-hour trade. The outperformance came on solid consumer tax revenue as well as effective management of marketing, sales, and employee expenses.Intuit reported revenues of $1.02 billion in the second quarter, up 16.1% from $878.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Reported revenue was in line with the higher end of management's guidance range of $1.0 billion to $1.02 billion and slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 billion.Product revenues decreased 2.6% year over year to $419.0 million, while Services and Other revenues climbed 33.9% from the prior-year quarter to $600.0 million.Segment-wise, the company's Small Business Group posted a 9.0% year-over-year growth based on the strength of the group's sub-segments. Financial Management Solutions revenue increased 6.0%, driven by higher subscription for QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Enterprise. Employee Management Solutions revenue was up 9.0%, led by growth in Intuit Online Payroll and Enhanced Payroll subscribers and improved adoption of direct deposit services. Online payroll subscribers grew 22.0%. Payment Solutions revenue increased 17.0%, with 11.0% growth in merchant customers.Consumer Tax, being the best performing segment during the quarter, posted 44.0% revenue growth. Apart from seasonality, lower revenue recognized in the comparable quarter last year due to a problem in IRS (Internal Revenue Service) favored the comps.The Financial Services revenue increased 9.0% driven by the growing popularity of Intuit's online and mobile solutions. Accounting Professionals segment revenue increased 8.0%. Other Businesses revenue declined 5.0% due to lower Quicken revenue. Intuit's global business grew revenue 8.0%.Reported gross margin fell 10 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 79.4%.Operating margin in the quarter jumped 620 bps year over year to 18.8% on better cost management. Though total operating expenses increased 5.1%, the percentage on total revenue contracted.GAAP net income was $118.0 million or 39 cents per share, compared with $73.0 million or 23 cents per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. Excluding amortization expenses but including stock-based compensation expenses, the adjusted net income in the quarter stood at $127.3 million or 42 cents per share versus a loss of $80.9 million or 25 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Intuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of $959.0 million, down from $1.05 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $592.0 million compared with $166.0 million in the previous quarter. As of January 31, 2011, long-term debt was $999.0 million, up from $499.0 million in the prior quarter.Intuit had $260.0 million of operating cash in the second quarter versus $110.0 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure was $48.0 million. During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $331.0 million and paid $44.0 million as dividend.For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.95 billion to $1.99 billion. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.125 billion. Non-GAAP operating income is estimated in the $1.14 billion to $1.17 billion range. GAAP diluted EPS is projected in the range of $2.36 to $2.40. The company also expects non-GAAP diluted EPS in the $2.47 to $2.51 range.For fiscal 2012, the company still expects revenues in the $4.185 billion to $4.285 billion range, representing growth of 9.0% to 11.0%. But management has guided for better operating margin and earnings for fiscal 2012. GAAP operating income is estimated between $1.190 billion and $1.215 billion (previously $1.185-$1.210 billion), reflecting growth of 18% to 21%. Non-GAAP operating income is projected at $1.405- $1.430 billion (previously $1.4-$1.425 billion), representing growth of 12.0% to 14.0%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to grow in the range of 22.0-25.0% to $2.43-$2.50 (previously $2.38 to $2.47). Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected between $2.90 and $2.97 (previously $2.85 to $2.94), indicating a growth of 16.0% to 18.0%.Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered impressive second quarter results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates both on top and bottom lines. Though revenue expectation for the upcoming quarter was kept unchanged, the company was prudent enough to raise its operating margin and EPS guidance.We are encouraged by the company's recent data that shows 10% year-over-year increase in Turbo Tax units till February 18. The improvement was mainly due to the vast popularity of the Web-based version of the product.However, we remain concerned due to the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and ongoing uncertainty in the economy at large. Moreover, we think that Intuit is going to face stiff competition from the leading payroll solution provider  (  ) in the SMB (small and medium business) sector as the latter introduced certain tools that aim at solving certain tax credit related problems for SMBs.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term Sell rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intuit Beats, Guides Firmly - Analyst Blog@2012-02-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intuit-beats-guides-firmly-analyst-blog-2012-02-22

"t's taken more than a decade, but the Nasdaq has finally overcome the dot-com crash.The move has been a quiet sneak attack by the bulls, who in recent weeks have driven the Nasdaq 100 to its highest levels since early 2001. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000, on the other hand, remained trapped below their 2007 highs.This is a big deal, and investors need to pay attention if they're serious about making money. We now face the prospect of a run back to the old bubble highs, which could entail almost a doubling of the index before it's done.I have to admit that I've been a little slow to catch this trend. But as I take a long-term view of the NDX, there is no denying how bullish the chart is. Consider these points:In contrast, the SPX's 200-day moving average is still falling, and its 100-day average remains below its 200-day.The weekly chart also paints a more bullish picture for the NDX because its 200-week moving average has been rising since early 2010. The SPX's is still dropping, while the DJI's only started rising in recent weeks, which means they're still licking their wounds from the 2008 crash.It's also interesting that the NDX bounced at 2034 during the August 2011 selloff, its old resistance level from April 2010. The SPX and DJI, meanwhile, fell below those corresponding levels on their charts. And one final point is that the NDX made a higher low in October 2011 than it did in August, once again contrasting with the performance of the DJI and SPX.You'll notice in this analysis a complete absence of certain words that have dominated public awareness in recent months. No mention of ""Greece,"" ""recession,"" or ""China hard landing."" No discussion of ""multiples,"" ""buybacks"" or ""dividends."" Just highs and lows, relative performance and moving averages.Maybe if I had been paying more attention to the charts and less to all those other distractions, I could have brought you this news five months ago when it would have been even more useful. That's a lesson for all of us.One word that must be mentioned in any NDX discussion is Apple, because the consumer-electronics giant is a major force pulling the index higher. But there are plenty of other good stocks in the index.I will close by listing a few stocks that look interesting. Because I am focusing on charts today, I won't mention their businesses or their fundamentals. Except for Endo, all are in the NDX. Once again, treat these as opening suggestions rather than outright recommendations. Trending higher with a decent pullback in the last week. It's now finding support at its 50-day moving average and the same level where it peaked in November and December. Gapped down last month but holding above its 200-day moving average. It's also now above its 10-day, which could signal a short-term bullish reversal. A rebound back to the recent highs around $53 seems completely doable. Trending higher but had a nice pullback in the last two weeks. Shares are trying to find support at their 50-day moving average but may test down to support around $30.50 before rebounding. Pulling back to its 50-day, its 200-day, and the level that was resistance in December. And it had a bullish call roll on Feb. 14.

 (  ) reported second quarter 2012 earnings of 68 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings per share increased 9.7% year over year on the back of strong revenue growth.Revenues increased 7.4% year over year to $2.58 billion and was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Organic growth was 6.0% in the quarter. The better-than-expected result was driven by strong new business sales, improving client retention and incremental revenue from recent acquisitions.Employer Services revenue increased 7.0% year over year (5.0% organically) to $1.83 billion. The number of employees on clients' payrolls in the United States grew 2.8% in the quarter on a same-store-sales basis.PEO Services revenue spiked 15.5% year over year to $413.8 million in the second quarter. Dealer Services revenue climbed 6.9% year over year to $412.6 million.Interest on funds held for clients declined 9% year over year to $117.9 million, due to a decline of 50 bps in the average interest yield to 3.0%, partially offset by a 6.0% increase in average client funds balances to $15.6 billion.Total expenses in the reported quarter increased 7.5% year over year to $2.10 billion, due to higher operating expenses (up 11.4% year over year) and selling, general & administrative expense (up 1.3% year over year).The company reported pre-tax earnings of $513.7 million, up 6.0% on year-over-year basis. However, pre-tax margin declined 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 19.9% in the reported quarter.Employer Services' pre-tax margin declined 120 bps on a year-over-year basis. PEO Services pre-tax margin improved 20 bps, while Dealer Services pre-tax margin enhanced 220 bps year over year in the reported quarter.Net income increased 7.6% year over year to $333.8 million. Net margin, however, remained flat at 12.9% in the quarter.As of December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents (including short-term marketable securities) were $1.36 billion, compared with $1.27 billion as of September 30, 2011. Long-term debt decreased to $25.5 million at the end of second quarter from $26.0 million in the prior quarter. ADP purchased 6.3 million shares for $305.0 million during the reported quarter.For fiscal 2012, ADP expects total revenue to increase in the range of 7.0%-9.0%. EPS is expected to increase 8%-9% over the year-ago earnings per share of $2.52. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 is pegged at $2.74 per share.Employer Services is expected to grow approximately 7% and pre-tax margins to expand 30 bps. The company expects pays per control to increase approximately 2.5% (prior outlook 2.0%) for fiscal 2012.PEO Services revenue is forecasted to improve 17.0%. Pre-tax margin is expected to grow slightly on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal 2012, ADP expects Dealer Services revenue to increase in the 9.0%-10.0% range (prior forecast 8%-9%) with a pre-tax margin expansion of at least 50 bps.The company expects interest on funds held for clients to decline $45.0 million-$55.0 million or 8%-10% from $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. However, the company expects 6%-7% increase in the average client fund balances.We believe that ADP will continue to outperform the broader market based on strong new business sales, diversified product portfolio, improving customer retention, accretive acquisitions, strong balance sheet and shareholder-friendly programs (aggressive share buybacks, dividend) over the long term.However, increasing competition from  and  and a gloomy macro outlook in North America and Europe are major headwinds in the near term. Additionally, higher unemployment rates and low interest rates remain concerns for the company's payroll processing business.We have a Neutral recommendation on ADP over the long term.

 (  ) reported second-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings of 39 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The quarter's results indicate slow recovery in the small and medium business (  ) sector. Paychex is highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand due to high unemployment and inflation rates. Shares decreased 1.62% in after-market trade.Paychex reported second-quarter 2012 revenues of $545.7 million, up 6.6% from $512.0 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to year-over-year growth in both checks processed per client and the HR services client base.Payroll Service segment revenue increased 4.8% from the year-ago quarter to $371.7 million, attributable to the contribution from SurePayroll Inc., acquired in February. Excluding the SurePayroll contribution, Payroll revenue would have grown only 3.0%.Continued increase in checks processed per client as well as revenue per checks also aided the growth. But the growth was not at par with the historical trend. Moreover, the increase in new unit sales was sluggish, due to the limited number of new companies commencing business during the quarter.The Human Resource Services segment generated $163.3 million in revenues, up 12.5% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was partly based on the contribution from ePlan Services, which was acquired in May. Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Services' revenue growth would have been 10.0%.The number of client employees served and the number of clients grew during the quarter, contributing to the improvement. Moreover, demand for a new product, HR Essentials, also added to the segment's revenue growth.In the second quarter, Paychex incurred total operating expense of $327.8 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to acquisition-related costs as well as the company's continued efforts to train sales personnel, provide better customer service and enhance technological infrastructure.Operating income was $217.9 million, up 6.9% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth and better cost management. Operating margin grew 640 basis points year over year to 41.7%.Net income of $140.4 million in the reported quarter reflected a 4.9% increase from $133.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 39 cents compared with 37 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Paychex exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $96.1 million, down from $113.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments decreased $57.0 million sequentially to $315.0 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 10.8% year over year to $10.7 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Cash from operations was $110.0 million compared to $187.2 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million compared to $20.2 million in the prior quarter.Keeping in view the current market and economic conditions, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human Resource Services revenues.Moreover, the favorability in expenses realized in the second quarter may not be realized throughout fiscal 2012 due to the planned investments in its business. Hence, Paychex reaffirmed its full-year guidance.For fiscal 2012, Paychex expects a 5-7% increase in Payroll Service revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 12.0% to 15.0%.Total service revenue is likely to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. The company expects a 12-14% decline in interest on funds held for clients and a roughly 2% increase in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to continue, increasing investment income.Net operating income is expected in the range of 35-36% of total service revenue. The effective tax rate is expected to be in line with the second quarter and net margin is projected at between 5% and 7%.The guidance for fiscal 2012 includes anticipated results from Paychex' recent acquisition of SurePayroll Inc. and its ePlan Services. The acquisitions are expected to have an approximately 2% positive impact on revenue, nonetheless resulting in earnings dilution of around 1 cent per share due to amortization on acquired intangible assets and some one-time acquisition costs.Paychex' second quarter results were modest, with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by mere a penny. We are also positive on management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and synergies from the recent acquisition. We also believe that cost control will remain a catalyst for Paychex, going forward.Though new business wins in the SMB sector and stiff competition from  (  ) and Administaff Inc. will remain a constant worry, we believe that Paychex can benefit from the improvement in the U.S. employment situation and zero European exposure.Paychex has a Zacks # 2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Beats Despite SMB Slowdown - Analyst Blog@2011-12-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-beats-despite-smb-slowdown-analyst-blog-2011-12-21
 (  ) recently announced the acquisition of privately held PhyLogic Healthcare LLC, a well known provider of revenue cycle management (RCM) and medical billing outsourcing services. However, terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Founded in 2001, Springfield, Massachusetts-based PhyLogic provides billing and accounts receivable services to medical practitioners across the U.S. The company also provides electronic health records (EHR) and cloud-based practice management (  ) solutions. Post acquisition, PhyLogic will be integrated into ADP's medical office software division, AdvancedMD that was acquired in early 2011.The acquisition of PhyLogic marks an important addition to ADP's portfolio, as it will help the company to enter the fast growing RCM market. The U.S. RCM market is expected to grow from approximately $4 billion in 2010 to more than $9 billion by 2018, driven by the upcoming medical reimbursement regulation changes, according to ST Advisors, LLC.We believe that the PhyLogic acquisition will help ADP to seize this significant opportunity over the long term. Moreover, PhyLogic's client base primarily consists of small- and mid-size U.S. medical practitioners, a niche market that ADP has been focusing on for some time. ADP is also expected to widen its presence in the small business services segment through this acquisition.ADP's growth in recent years has been largely driven by accretive acquisitions, for which it has spent approximately $776 million in 2011 itself. If the latest acquisitions are anything to go by, then the company clearly intends to continue along the same lines in 2012.In early January, ADP entered the lucrative Indian market with the acquisition of Ma Foi Consulting Solutions Ltd, an Indian human resource and payroll management company. The acquisition is a strategic fit for the company as it will facilitate further expansion in developing markets. Through this acquisition, ADP will gain access to the growing market of human resource business process outsourcing (HR BPO) in India.We believe that the back-to-back acquisitions will drive top-line growth for fiscal 2012 and beyond. The acquisitions are expected to diversify ADP's revenue base, which in turn will help the company to outperform the market, in our view.However, increasing competition from  . (  ) and  .

ew York-based outsourcing service provider  (  ) recently announced the takeover of online and PC-based time and attendance solutions provider, Icon Time Systems Inc. Financial details of the transaction were not divulged. Post the acquisition, Icon Time will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paychex and all its employees will be retained.Founded in 1989, Icon Time serves small businesses with its PC-based and web-enabled time and attendance products. Icon's experience and innovation in the time and attendance market is expected to help Paychex enrich its Payroll services products, specifically the PST 1000 time clock.In February last year, Paychex partnered with Icon Time for the launch of the Paychex PST 1000 time clock, which immediately curtails the time spent to calculate timesheets and compile employee information. Alongside, the time clock also enhances payroll productivity and accuracy. According to company officials, the product has remained a great revenue earner till date.Paychex has always been enthusiastic about strengthening Payroll activities. In May 2011, the company took over recordkeeping and administrative solutions provider, ePlan Services. ePlan Services' Web-based platform complements Paychex' existing recordkeeping business. PLANSPONSOR magazine had acknowledged Paychex as the leading recordkeeper in the U.S. With ePlan Services' under its wing, Paychex will be able to serve financial advisers with clarity into fee structures, while the market transitions to full disclosure models to keep pace with consumer and legislative demand.Apart from this, Paychex also solidified its Payroll Services segment with the acquisition of the online payroll solutions provider, SurePayroll Inc. in December 2010. Paychex had to shell out $115.0 million in cash for this deal.Though the company's initiative for boosting the Payroll Services segment is encouraging, the effort is not showing up in its results. The segment is not performing well mainly due to the lack of new business wins.Small businesses are significant revenue sources for Paychex. But the SMB (small and medium business) sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand due to high unemployment and inflation rates. Paychex is highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason the company may not see much revenue growth in the near term.Despite the concern in the SMB sector, Paychex delivered modest second quarter results by marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line. Moreover, we are encouraged by Paychex' endeavour to introduce a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that is tailor-made for  's (  ) iPad. With this, the ace payroll, human resource and benefits outsourcing solutions provider will be able to compete against its rivals,  (  ) and  (  ), whose SaaS-based mobile solutions have already gained decent market share.Paychex has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Takes Over Icon Time - Analyst Blog@2012-01-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-takes-over-icon-time-analyst-blog-2012-01-12
 (  ) recently marked its entry into the lucrative Indian market with the acquisition of Ma Foi Consulting Solutions Ltd, an Indian human resource and payroll management company. The acquired company was previously a part of Ma Foi Randstad, an Indian subsidiary of RANDSTAND HOLDINGS. Though the financial details of the deal were not disclosed, ADP stated that it will incorporate Ma Foi's 200 associates.ADP will now manage Ma Foi's extensive Indian clientele, including both domestic and multinational companies. The acquisition is a strategic fit for the company as it will facilitate further expansion in developing markets. Through this acquisition, ADP will gain access to the growing market of human resource business process outsourcing (HR BPO) in India.Incidentally, Ma Foi and ADP have enjoyed a healthy business relationship since 2009 for the marketing and operations of ADP Streamline, ADP's multi-country payroll and human resource service.ADP's growth in recent years has been largely attributable to accretive acquisitions, for which it has spent approximately $776 million in 2011 itself. The company reported a year-over-year increase of 11.0% in total revenue to $9.88 billion in fiscal 2011, driven by a 4.7% growth from the acquired businesses.Recently, ADP acquired The RightThing, a leading recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) provider. The acquisition is expected to expand ADP's human resources business process outsourcing portfolio and complement the existing applicant tracking and talent management solutions, thereby boosting ADP's customer base and top-line growth going forward.Moreover, the acquisition of privately held WALLACE is expected to further boost ADP's tax credit solutions portfolio and expand its customer base going forward.We believe that the back-to-back acquisitions will drive top-line growth for fiscal 2012 and beyond. The new acquisitions are expected to diversify ADP's revenue growth base, which in turn will help the company to outperform the market, in our view.However, increasing competition from  (  ) and  (  ) and a gloomy macro outlook in North America and Europe are the major headwinds in the near term. Additionally, higher unemployment rates and low interest rates remain concerns for the company's payroll processing business.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on the stock over the long term (6-12 months). Currently, Automatic Data Processing has a Zacks #4 Rank, which implies a Sell rating on a short-term basis. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADP Reaches India - Analyst Blog@2012-01-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adp-reaches-india-analyst-blog-2012-01-17
ayroll and human resources services provider Paychex, Inc. (  ) late Tuesday posted slightly better-than-expected fiscal second quarter earnings, although revenue totals fell short of Wall Street's view.The Rochester, NY-based company reported fiscal second quarter net income of $140.4 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with $133.9 million, or 37 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Revenue rose 7% from last year to $545.7 million.On average, Wall Street analysts expected a smaller profit of 38 cents per share, albeit on higher revenue of $551 million.Looking ahead, PAYX reiterated its previously-announced full-year 2012 earnings growth of 5% to 7% over 2011. That guidance could miss, meet, or even exceed analyst estimates.Paychex shares were unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday.Shares of Paychex (  ) have a 4.23% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $30.24. The stock has technical support in the $27 price area. If the shares can firm up, we see overhead resistance around the $31-$32 price levels. .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Q2 Profit Beats, but Revenue Falls Short (PAYX)@2011-12-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-q2-profit-beats-revenue-falls-short-payx-2011-12-21
 (  ) reported second-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings of 39 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The quarter's results indicate slow recovery in the small and medium business (  ) sector. Paychex is highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand due to high unemployment and inflation rates. Shares decreased 1.62% in after-market trade.Paychex reported second-quarter 2012 revenues of $545.7 million, up 6.6% from $512.0 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to year-over-year growth in both checks processed per client and the HR services client base.Payroll Service segment revenue increased 4.8% from the year-ago quarter to $371.7 million, attributable to the contribution from SurePayroll Inc., acquired in February. Excluding the SurePayroll contribution, Payroll revenue would have grown only 3.0%.Continued increase in checks processed per client as well as revenue per checks also aided the growth. But the growth was not at par with the historical trend. Moreover, the increase in new unit sales was sluggish, due to the limited number of new companies commencing business during the quarter.The Human Resource Services segment generated $163.3 million in revenues, up 12.5% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was partly based on the contribution from ePlan Services, which was acquired in May. Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Services' revenue growth would have been 10.0%.The number of client employees served and the number of clients grew during the quarter, contributing to the improvement. Moreover, demand for a new product, HR Essentials, also added to the segment's revenue growth.In the second quarter, Paychex incurred total operating expense of $327.8 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to acquisition-related costs as well as the company's continued efforts to train sales personnel, provide better customer service and enhance technological infrastructure.Operating income was $217.9 million, up 6.9% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth and better cost management. Operating margin grew 640 basis points year over year to 41.7%.Net income of $140.4 million in the reported quarter reflected a 4.9% increase from $133.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 39 cents compared with 37 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Paychex exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $96.1 million, down from $113.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments decreased $57.0 million sequentially to $315.0 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 10.8% year over year to $10.7 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Cash from operations was $110.0 million compared to $187.2 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million compared to $20.2 million in the prior quarter.Keeping in view the current market and economic conditions, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human Resource Services revenues.Moreover, the favorability in expenses realized in the second quarter may not be realized throughout fiscal 2012 due to the planned investments in its business. Hence, Paychex reaffirmed its full-year guidance.For fiscal 2012, Paychex expects a 5-7% increase in Payroll Service revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 12.0% to 15.0%.Total service revenue is likely to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. The company expects a 12-14% decline in interest on funds held for clients and a roughly 2% increase in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to continue, increasing investment income.Net operating income is expected in the range of 35-36% of total service revenue. The effective tax rate is expected to be in line with the second quarter and net margin is projected at between 5% and 7%.The guidance for fiscal 2012 includes anticipated results from Paychex' recent acquisition of SurePayroll Inc. and its ePlan Services. The acquisitions are expected to have an approximately 2% positive impact on revenue, nonetheless resulting in earnings dilution of around 1 cent per share due to amortization on acquired intangible assets and some one-time acquisition costs.Paychex' second quarter results were modest, with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by mere a penny. We are also positive on management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and synergies from the recent acquisition. We also believe that cost control will remain a catalyst for Paychex, going forward.Though new business wins in the SMB sector and stiff competition from  (  ) and Administaff Inc. will remain a constant worry, we believe that Paychex can benefit from the improvement in the U.S. employment situation and zero European exposure.Paychex has a Zacks # 2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Beats Despite SMB Slowdown - Analyst Blog@2011-12-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-beats-despite-smb-slowdown-analyst-blog-2011-12-21

The quarter's results indicate slow recovery in the small and medium business (  ) sector due to deceleration in high unemployment and inflation rates.Paychex' second quarter revenues grew 6.6% year over year, backed by increases of 12.5% in Human Resource Service revenue and 4.8% in Payroll Service revenue.A modest revenue growth and better cost management led to operating margin expansion of 640 basis points year over year. Nevertheless, Paychex seemed a bit cautious about the fiscal 2012 guidance.Keeping in view the current market and economic condition, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human Resource Service revenues.Moreover, Paychex believes that the favorability in expenses realized in the second quarter may not be realized throughout fiscal 2012 due to the planned investments in its business.For more details of second quarter earnings, please visit:  .Out of the 20 and 23 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively, none made any revision in the last 30 days.

Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive pricing from  (  ) is stealing customers away from Paychex.The time difference between when the company receives payments from its clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating lower interest rates, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.There was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter or fiscal 2012 over the past 30 days. We also see that there was no change in estimates over the past 90 days, implying that analysts have stuck to their estimates post second quarter results.The market is losing confidence on the growth of the SMB group. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand that comes on the heels of high unemployment and inflation rates. Outsourcing companies like Paychex are highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason why it may not see much revenue growth.However, we are encouraged by management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and synergies from the recent acquisition.

()November and December jobless claims have decreased in the US, and a slew of other economic data released Thursday suggests the US recovery is picking up. There’s still work to do, but the US can take some solace in the point of fact that its economy is “expanding moderately.”Take a look at some key data points, referenced from :New US claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 3.5-year low last week, according to a government report. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000.Although unemployment remains high, analysts say unemployment below 350,000 “signals labor market strength.”A separate report showed inflation remained in check in November, although wholesale prices rose moderately. Retail sales rose modestly in November, which is in “sharp contrast to Europe” where sovereign debt cripples spending.According to Reuters, the number of Americans on emergency unemployment benefits increased 254,642 to 3.05 million in the week ended Nov. 26.During that time, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits under all programs rose by 874,670 to a total of 7.45 million.America is not in the clear yet. The greatest hurdle will come from the EU, which has yet to succeed or fail in its mission to solve its debt crisis. Its actions and outcome pose heavy risks for the US economy.In times of uncertainty many investors turn to dividend stocks.

"he focus was back on fundamentals for the markets today, and investors didn't take too well to some of the earnings results.Before we delve into the stocks making headlines today, I just wanted to point out a recent story that has me shaking my head. Today, the National Association of Realtors revised existing home sales data for the 2007-2010 period by 14%. What does that mean? It means that the agency mistakenly reported a significantly higher amount of existing home sales during that period than had actually occurred.What a shock! The organization that represents the interests of real estate agencies overestimated the numbers to their benefit. This development is just another example of why we should always remain skeptical of the economic data we're greeted with on a daily basis. As investors, our focus should be squarely on company and industry fundamentals. Those metrics are what will ultimately determine share prices over the long term.Getting back to the earnings results from earlier today, reports from names such as Oracle Corp (  ) (  ), Walgreen Company (  ) (  ), and Paychex (  ) (  ), were met with selling by market participants, although Walgreen Co. did bounce nicely off the early lows. On the flipside, buyers liked the results from Nike (  ) (  ) and Cintas (  ), with both stocks trading in the green all day.Anyone checking out our  section today will notice that we trimmed the ratings on several recommended names. These stocks are still recommended, but due to the recent outperformance and share price run-ups, we felt compelled to cut their ratings just a bit. Again, these names are all still on our  . It's just that the valuations for some have gotten a little less attractive, so subscribers should consider looking at some of the other names we currently recommend which may have similar ratings at this point.It is always great to see the media tip their hat to what has been a great year for dividend-paying stocks. We're seeing several major media outlets publishing articles about how dividends were a big investing theme in 2011.The truth is that we tend to see solid years more often than not in the dividend world, but the business media focuses their attention instead on the high-risk momentum action. Only in times of extreme duress does the media seem to focus on our dividend niche. Regardless, we won't be distracted from our job of finding the best dividend names to put fresh capital into.I'd like to thank all our  subscribers and newsletter readers for helping spread the word about our service.

()The Federal Reserve’s Tuesday afternoon announcement highlighted the US economy’s exposure to financial troubles abroad while citing signs of moderate growth within the US.“Federal Reserve policy makers said the U.S. economy is maintaining its expansion even as the global economy slows, while refraining from taking new actions to lower borrowing costs,” reports .According to the Fed, issues pertaining to the unemployment rate “remain elevated” and debate exists on how to approach it. Similarly, interest rates, inflation and bond purchases bear addressing.But don’t hold your breath, members of the Fed are at ends of how to address these issues. More importantly, “any additional stimulus is greatly going to depend on what happens in Europe or any changes in the U.S. outlook,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC. “They will wait for a longer meeting, maybe in January, to come up with anything regarding communications.”The Fed said it expects inflation to settle at levels at or below those consistent with its price stability mandate. The Fed also noted it would keep its Fed funds target rate at low levels “at least through mid-2013.”Stocks dipped after the Fed’s statement, and the dollar rose against the Euro.In short, the Fed has taken no action, nor indicated strong intentions to make decisions in the future.The key takeaway was that the US’ greatest risk comes from troubles in Europe. Investors are sure to keep their eyes on the headline.Think things might improve?If so, you may be curious what companies could benefit most from increased growth in the US. For ideas we took a look at large-cap companies (market caps above $10 billion) on the S&P 500 index. We screened the names for those with the highest levels of profitability compared to their industry peers based on pretax, operating and gross margins.Do you think these companies are operating well enough to benefit from a US rally?1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentionedList sorted by greatest difference in gross margin.

The tools, namely Small Business Tax Credit Estimator and Small Business Tax Credit Package, have been innovated by Paychex Insurance Agency, a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex.SMBs offering health insurance to their employees are likely to receive certain tax benefits by way of tax credits. These tools will be of immense importance for them to calculate tax credits arising from payment of health insurance premiums.The first tool is a free web-based tool and can be accessed through the website PaychexInsurance.com. The tool follows the IRS (Internal revenue Service) guidelines and based on employees' hours, wages, premiums, and employer contributions, it helps to calculate the estimated credit.Using the second tool, small business owners can assess their eligibility to receive the tax credit and thereby they can file for the same, if found eligible. However, to reap the benefits of the package for the 2012 calendar tax year, business owners have to be a Paychex payroll and Paychex Insurance Agency client for the entire 2012 calendar year.It can be seen that both the tools are not directly linked to revenue generation. But this might bring a light of hope for the company by way of winning new businesses from the SMB sector.The SMB sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand due to high unemployment and inflation rates. Paychex is highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason the company may not see much revenue growth in the near term.Despite the concern in the SMB sector, Paychex delivered modest second quarter results by marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on bottom line. Moreover, we are encouraged by Paychex' endeavour to introduce a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that is tailor-made for  's (  ) iPad. With this, the ace payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions provider will be able to compete its rivals,  (  ) and  (  ), whose SaaS-based mobile solutions have already gained decent market share.Paychex has a Zacks # 3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex's New Tax Solution for SMB - Analyst Blog@2011-12-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychexs-new-tax-solution-for-smb-analyst-blog-2011-12-28
"DP (  ), the leading provider of payroll services and human resource outsourcing in the U.S., is making move to modernize its services and expand the range of services it provides to consumers. ADP handles payroll for one in six working Americans and competes with other established players like Paychex (  ) as well as startups like Workday.We currently have a  , about 15% above the current market price.We earlier discussed that ADP is bringing its popular payroll management platform for small businesses to the Android smartphone operating platform through a suite of mobile apps. (See  )While Payroll Processing is the largest value driver for ADP accounting for over 85% of our price estimate for the firm, ADP in recent years has built out a suite of non-payroll services that include human resources, recruiting and talent management, background checks and benefits administration.ADP's CTO Michael Capone said that the non-payroll business is growing at about twice the rate of the payroll business and there are opportunities for revenue growth inside the client's businesses. The firm has started to bump up its offerings and recently bought AdvancedMD, practice management services firm for doctors. Last July, ADP bought Workscape which sells a high-end benefits administration platform.The firm is also planning to upgrade its entire suite of on-demand services to give them a more up-to-date, Web 2.0-style interface. ""People expect a better experience these days. They expect to get the Web 2.0-Facebook type experience when they come to work,"" said Capone. ((  , cio.com)We currently forecast ADP's fee per employee for Major payroll accounts to increase from ~$210 in 2010 to $280 by the end of the Trefis forecast period. However, the growth in fee per employee could be much higher if ADP successfully leverages its client base while rolling out expanded non-payroll services and is able to generate higher user adoption with its new and improved interface to be released in October.In a scenario where ADP is able to charge higher fee per employee across its client types driven by above factors, there could be significant upside to our $62.50 Trefis price estimate for ADP.

"he market staged a nice recovery off the lows of the day as news circulated that Greece has a pending agreement with the EU and IMF on a 5-year austerity plan. News that the U.S. will release 30 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserves had the price plummeting over $4 a barrel by the close. The hope is for the price drop to translate into lower gasoline prices, which directly benefits consumers and businesses alike. Many pundits are intently focused on gasoline needing to be below $3.50 a gallon. I would prefer we get back to the $2.50 level of last spring, and it's possible we can get there if commodity speculators panic. Again, I am with Jim Cramer on the notion of higher margin requirements for commodity trading being raised, so as to avoid putting an unnecessary crunch on consumers as a result of market speculation.Our cautious stance toward putting any new money into energy plays is being rewarded, as we saw many integrated oil names take a hit today. We would love to see some of these names come down a bit more for us to get excited about adding them back on to our  . Some of the hardest hit names in the space today included Exxon Mobil (  ), Marathon Oil (  ), and Chevron (  ). Elsewhere, Wall Street downgrades pushed down share prices of St. Jude Medical (  ) and Time Warner Cable (  ). Bucking the selling today were shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb (  ) on the company's just released positive data points for a drug it is co-developing with Pfizer (  ). Paychex (  ) shares were also higher following the company's earnings results.There was lots of hoopla last week surrounding AARP's apparent softening stance with regards to cuts in social security benefits. For years, AARP has been the loudest when it comes to opposing any cuts to social security whatsoever. The government budget estimates the social security program could exhaust all its funds by the year 2036 if steps aren't taken soon to avoid this calamity. We certainly believe there will be a strong push to raise the retirement age several times over the next couple of decades in order to buy some time until other initiatives are considered.When it comes to retirement and social security, we have been sharing some of the data with readers that has been released over the last year. Here is a partial recap of some of the more profound statistics we have covered.- A record 33% of Americans now plan on working past the age of 70.But here's what American workers actually have: 43% have less than $10,000 in retirement savings, while 31% of workers have saved NOTHING for retirement.- 30% of adult children contribute financially to their parents. That number will grow. (N.Y. Times)- Even as fears mount, only 46% of workers have tried to calculate what they need to save for retirement. A record 51% doubt they can pay for medical expenses in retirement. Long-term care is no longer an affordable option for most retirees.- There were 36 million ""senior"" Americans in 2000. There will be 70 million by 2030. (Census Bureau)- Back in 1950 each retiree's Social Security benefit was paid for by 16 workers. Today, each retiree's Social Security benefit is paid for by approximately 3.3 workers. By 2025 it is projected that there will be approximately two workers for each retiree.- 35% of Americans over the age of 65 rely almost totally on Social Security alone.- Only 17% of employees are on target to reach their retirement goals in terms of income replacement. (Financial Fitness Research)- Starting in January 2011, more than 10,000 baby boomers a day will turn 65, a pattern that will continue for the next 19 years.- Nearly three out of four people file to claim Social Security benefits as soon as they're eligible at age 62. That locks them in at a much lower amount than they would get if they waited. The monthly checks are about 25 percent less if you retire at 62 instead of full retirement age, which is 66 for those born from 1943 to 1954. If you wait until 70, your check can be 75 to 80 percent more than at 62. (Source: Employee Benefit Research Institute)The retirement picture hasn't suddenly started deteriorating overnight. We have been seeing gloomy data for years indicating how poorly prepared individuals are for retirement, how little money they have saved up, and the lousy job many do investing with what little they have to invest. I can go on and on, but you probably get the picture.No one ever wants to worry about running out of money or being a financial burden to your kids when you can put a system in place now to prevent any potential struggles. Start cutting your debt immediately, especially high interest debt (credit cards, etc.). Keep your living expenses in line so you can free up money every month that can be invested into assets that produce income. You need to get the power of compound interest in place to begin generating long-term wealth. If your home is going to be your biggest expense when you near retirement, think about downsizing or even relocating to an area where the cost of living can work well with your financial situation. Taking a part-time job to help alleviate some of your health insurance costs is a great idea as well.To be successful in long-term investing, you need a plan. Let's take a look at some of the basics that any financial plan should include:- First of all, you must have ultimate goals in order to put together a financial map to follow.- Understand your risk profile and where you are in life, in relation to what the top-line goals are.- A good financial planner can help you construct your short-term and long-term goals, analyze where your money is currently being spent, as well as figuring out where you may want to look for investment ideas that fit your risk profile.The key thing to remember about a financial plan is to be flexible. Your life changes, and so should your plan. As families come into play, you'll eventually need to consider your estate situation, identifying the beneficiaries for specific holdings, and make sure you have enough insurance to protect your loved ones. Make it a habit to perform an annual evaluation of where you are financially, as well as the situation regarding the economy and how that could affect your investment holdings.I am dealing front and center with retirement issues myself, as my parents are both retired. The biggest misconception many people have as they approach retirement is that their cost of living will automatically decline. While some of this may be true (ex: mortgage could be paid off), the reality is their everyday/month bills increase (property taxes/rent, health care costs, food/utilities, etc.). If your retirement income is not sufficient, the golden years become much less enjoyable as the focus becomes centered on cutting back. Dreams of traveling and pursuing hobbies can get shelved quickly. Each day you have a chance to make investment moves into income-producing assets that can make your retirement dreams or other financial goals much more of a reality.Finding the right strategy for investing is essential (and we wholeheartedly believe in dividend investing as the solution for readers out there). Putting what you've learned into practice is the second step. We advocate investors develop a monthly system of putting money to work in your brokerage accounts. Automate this process as best you can, so you remove any barrier of thinking whether you want to skip a month or two if the market is pulling back. Embrace the learning process of what you decide your investing strategy is. This basically means you are willing to keep an eye on what your money and investments are doing. Staying in the loop is a great thing and you will get the biggest benefit out of it. Just dabbling in the markets will not get you to where you need to be. Putting money to work every month should be a regular routine. If you have a habit of jumping in and out of the markets, dividend investing is the best remedy for that affliction. You will get a new perspective on what long-term investing and the power of compound interest can deliver.On a final note, be sure to check out our weekly  post that is out today, only for  members.Thanks for reading, and I'll see you tomorrow! P.S. Please pass this e-mail on to someone you think can use some financial motivation as well as being kept in the  loop that could affect them.

DP's (  ) most important business division - payroll processing - accounts for roughly 86% of our  . ADP is a leading payroll processor in the U.S. along with Paychex (  ) and serves many large businesses as well as caters to a sizable number of small businesses (fewer than 50 employees).Below we take a look at a potential upside and downside scenario for the firm.The operating margin for ADP's payroll processing business has increased from just over 21% in 2005 to near 27% in 2010 as revenue growth outpaced the increase in costs for the division.We forecast the operating margin will remain constant for the rest of the Trefis forecast period. There could be 7-8% upside to the Trefis price estimate if ADP's payroll processing operating margins continue to increase in the future reaching 30% by the end of our forecast period.We currently forecast the number of major payroll processing clients, those with 50 to 500 employees, of ADP will increase going forward from 63,000 in 2010 to almost 69,000 by the end of the Trefis forecast period.However, there could be 3-4% downside to the Trefis price estimate if ADP's major payroll accounts decline in the future falling below 60,000 as ADP continues to witness weakness in new sales for major accounts.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@An Upside/Downside Scenario for ADP@2011-05-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/upsidedownside-scenario-adp-2011-05-23
n its Q3'11 recent earnings release, Paychex (  ) reported a 2.8% growth in checks per client over the same period last year. Checks per client, which represents the number of checks issued by Paychex divided by the client base, is a meaningful measure of the current state of the economy. Compared to competitor ADP (  ), a significant percentage of Paychex's client base consists of small and medium sized businesses (with fewer than 50 employees).Continued growth in checks per client (represented by average number of employees per payroll client) will boost Paychex's payroll processing revenues going forward and could spark upside to its stock. Payroll processing is the most important division for Paychex, constituting 70% of its stock value by our estimates. , about 15% below market price.The average number of employees per payroll client declined in 2008 and 2009 as recession took hold of the U.S. economy and sparked lay-offs by companies fighting to cut costs. Paychex's clients primarily fall into the small business category, a segment particularly vulnerable to difficult economic conditions.But as economic conditions improve and growth prospects for small businesses rise, the average number of employees per Paychex's payroll client should increase. Recent growth witnessed by Paychex in checks per client indicates that this trend is beginning to take hold.We estimate that the average number of employees per Paychex client will grow steadily from about 16 in 2010 towards 20 by the end of our forecast period. Should the economic recovery accelerate, there could be upside to  . If, for example, the average number of employees per Paychex payroll client increases towards 23 by the end of our forecast period (vs. our base case estimate of 20), it would imply 11% upside to our price estimate. While this would still leave our number below market price, it effectively closes the gap.Paychex provides payroll processing and other HR services related to insurance, retirement and health benefits.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex Needs a Push in Checks per Client to Justify Stock Price@2011-04-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-needs-push-checks-client-justify-stock-price-2011-04-05

In addition, traders will be taking their cues from the latest round of earnings reports, as well as a round of housing data expected to hit the Street just after the open.

However, the company slashed its second-quarter revenue guidance to a range of $970 million to $1.02 billion, or 47 cents to 54 cents a share, citing an uncertain business environment in post-earthquake Japan, which accounted for approximately 13% of Adobe's sales last year.

In fact, Tokyo Electric Power Co. - which owns the earthquake-shattered plant - paced the declining equities, giving up 4.5%. By the close, Japan's Nikkei index gave back almost 1.7%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index retreated 0.1%.

On the docket today is the latest policy decision from the Federal Reserve, followed by a press conference led by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.

"e are seeing spikes in some of the stocks that have been performing well in the first quarter. There are only six trading days left before the first quarter wraps up, so fund managers may be getting busy sprinkling some winners on to their portfolio (hence the term ""window dressing"").This could mean short-term profits may be had for aggressive investors playing the continued run in gold and silver prices. Anyone in this area should consider taking a bit of the easy gains off the table if things get frothy in the next week. Despite the argument of commodity prices being a solid long-term bet, it is still a trade in my opinion. Enjoy the run (with the rest of the traders), but know there needs to be some nimbleness if you are going to cash in on the commodity craze. Remember how real estate was supposed to be a tremendous long-term bet! Anything that spikes up as much as we have seen with commodity prices need to understand they can go down just as quickly. If anything, keep your sell-stops firmly in place and be sure to move them up along with rising prices. Just don't move them down if you see prices falling. You will only see more of your profits disappear or worse even, if you get in at the top of the craze, not keeping your stops in place can potentially set you up for big losses. Please be careful with the commodity plays (mining companies, ETFs, etc).Looking at the action today, Paychex (  ) and Scholastic Corp (  ) did not participate in today's rally, following both companies' earnings results. Also lower was Bank of America (  ) for a second consecutive day as analysts continue to urge caution with the name. A few standouts names included Rockwell Automation (  ), Johnson Controls (  ), both on the receiving end of analyst upgrades. Also, Colgate-Palmolive (  ) gained $2 in today's trading.We added a new name to our  today, so be sure to check out the link for the upgrade below if you did not read the e-mail alert we sent out to  members earlier.To follow up with what I was saying yesterday regarding multi-family real estate investments, some of the keys to remember when you are taking the next step and becoming a landlord:1. You have to do credit checks on potential tenants. Look for companies online that specialize in the field. You skip this step and you are certainly on your own.2. Avoid accepting partial month payments. This will start the poor paying habits off and your good gesture will not be appreciated in many cases.3. Start the eviction process as soon as a tenant is 15 days late with their rent. It sounds heartless, but you are running a business in a sense and can not afford to have your cash-flow disrupted.4. Get multiple estimates for any costly work that you will need done. Also, build a database of dependable service people that you can rely on in case of emergencies. Lastly, pay attention to the repairs being done and try and learn something so you can possibly fix basic issues that arise yourself.There are plenty of more things you will need to know, so if you are serious about generating income in real estate, keep these tips in mind and be sure to research the subject more. And don't forget, the data points coming from the real estate market continue to be somber. If you are itching to make an investment move, the multi-family niche could work if you do your homework. I still prefer the bulk of my investment dollars to be geared toward dividend-paying stocks, but there is nothing wrong with diversifying either.For those of you out there who are either just starting your careers or have been in a career for years, are you pleased with the direction you are going in or may be in already? It's funny, if you had told me 20 years ago that I'd wind up in the situation I am now, I probably wouldn't have believed you. At the time, I was running a retail business and hadn't even begun to think about the markets! As you can see, the wonderful thing about having the ambitious trait is that you never know what great things can come about if you pay attention to what is going on in the world and how your desire to succeed can often carry you to heights you never thought possible. As I get set to speak later on today at a university here in New Jersey, I am going to carry with me the message that planning your career out too far may not make the most sense in the world we live in today.Depending on the industry you are considering, you may find yourself touching 2,3, 4, different type of careers before you are ready to enjoy the golden years. If you are considering the medical field, and being a doctor, then you will likely stay the course. There is certainly nothing wrong with that choice of course. But for many, the pressure to ""pick something"" to do forever is way over-rated and is something parents may slowly have to discover. You increase the likelihood of having an outstanding career if you adopt a mindset that whatever business, service, or job you have offers value to others. There is no greater satisfaction than to know you have customers that are there for you and want you to help them. Depending on the business or job you are in, the demand can sometimes be overwhelming, but don't ever take your customers for granted. If we start to slack off here at Dividend.com and our results start to disappoint, we will certainly see a bottom line effect to how much we can earn and even more importantly the influence we will have in the investment world. Complacency becomes a danger to anyone that has tasted success for a certain amount of time. The best thing you can do is surround yourself with colleagues that are as hungry as you are and make that a key ingredient for you to succeed. Age should never stop someone from believing they can't reach higher mountains. Look at Warren Buffett continuing his passion of business each day. He continues to stay active in what he loves. I have mentioned a few times about Ray Kroc turning McDonald's into a national brand starting at age 59.

"Shutterstock photoI don't want to bury the lead, so let me start with my prediction:  .But before we get to that, let's add some context.To say that the job market is weak would be like saying the  horror movie franchise is a little gory. In fact, I'm not sure which has seen more bloodletting. Last month,  reported that 2.3 million California workers have been axed -- and that's just in the Golden State.Nationwide, the  has remained at elevated levels above 9.5% for 15 consecutive months, the longest such drought on record.The last time we saw a ""jobless recovery"" of this magnitude was in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, more than 2.5 million jobs were lost in the 18 months following the terror attacks. At that point, it seemed as if the labor market would never get in gear.But by January 2004, payrolls around the country were already expanding at a rate of 150,000 per month. And before long, the severe labor slump was over. We've seen this same scenario play out many times over the decades.In May 1975, in the wake of a painful recession, unemployment climbed above 9%. But then looser  (the Fed Funds rate was slashed from 12.9% to 5.2%) brought 10 million jobs in the next three years. The same thing happened in December 1982, when unemployment peaked at 10.8% before President Reagan's tax cuts kicked in and the ensuing expansion created 10 million jobs by the end of 1985.Interestingly, the same two catalysts that triggered those previous turnarounds will both soon be in place. In this case, money is nearly free and could get even cheaper thanks tothe Fed 's second round of Quantitative Easing, known as QE2. [For more, see our  at our sister site,  ] And I strongly suspect we'll see an extension of the Bush tax cuts in the next 60 days.Boom and bust. Bust and boom. Even my kindergarten son could tell you what's coming next in the cycle.Given the deteriorating balance sheets of state and local governments, I think the public sector will continue to shed jobs. [For more on that,  .] But the private sector is a different story.When I first began writing this article a few days ago, I was emboldened to see the ADP report showing 43,000 jobs created last month (double what economists were expecting). Now, Friday's official tally from the Labor Department revealed that the private sector actually added 159,000 positions in October -- while the figures from the prior two months were revised upward by 103,000.Simply put, I think we've reached an inflection point.  recently announced plan to spend $8 billion on new manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Oregon (which will employ up to 8,000 construction workers) could be a sign of things to come.We still have a long road ahead to recoup the eight million jobs lost in the past two years, but it's a step in the right direction. And as we all know, the market is a forward-looking mechanism. So if you want to profit from a reversal, you need to act before concrete signs of improvement are blindingly obvious to everyone else.If I'm right, and we do see sustained job growth of 200,000-plus each month by next summer, then there will be many beneficiaries, such as payroll processor  and  , which handles drug screens for employment candidates.But the two stocks below might have the most to gain. -- Anyone who grew up in the digital age is probably familiar with the Monster brand. The firm's well-known website is a popular gathering place that connects job seekers with potential employers.Just as  brings buyers and sellers together, Monster appeals to job hunters because of the abundance of postings, and to recruiters because the network reaches a pool of 84 million potential candidates. The company's recent acquisition of Yahoo! HotJobs will only widen the firm's footprint.Last quarter, Monster's bookings jumped +26% to $235 million. And management is expecting that rate to be maintained throughout 2011. Thatuptick in orders not only means stronger revenue on the horizon, but it's a clear signal that employers are ramping up hiring.The stock has had a nice run lately, but would have to climb another +200% from here to reach its former highs near $60. -- Robert Half is one of the world's largest staffing agencies and consulting firms. The firm helps fill vacancies in the  , finance and legal fields, billing clients for hours worked and then disbursing a portion of the proceeds to its workers -- pocketing the difference.Last year, the company found jobs for 157,000 temp workers -- and that was in the teeth of a recession.Whenever large companies sense an upturn (but don't want to pay the full salaries and benefits of new full-time positions), they often start by bringing in temporary help. And temp agencies have been growing briskly for months, adding 35,000 new workers in October.This bullish  points to an improvement in the overall labor market, and Robert Half International will be one of the first to feel the winds change direction. Sales and profits plunged -34% and -85%, respectively, last year, but I suspect we'll see sharp improvements in the next few quarters.Keep in mind, the last time we were on the cusp of a labor recovery, this stock surged +76% between April 2003 and January 2004. I see both stocks outpacing the S&P 500 next year. But don't wait too long -- as I stated earlier, I already see upbeat signs underneath the dreary headlines.Moving into a beleaguered sector where many other investors are fleeing takes nerves of steel -- but bold predictions like this tend to reward investors the most.[I've made 10 other predictions for 2011, which I just shared with my  subscribers in the latest issue.

DP (  ), a leading provider of human resource outsourcing and payroll services in the U.S., serves many large businesses and also caters to a sizeable number of small businesses (fewer than 50 employees). The firm recently announced that its popular payroll management platform for small businesses, RUN Powered by ADP, is now also available for the Android smartphone operating platform. ADP's competitors in this space include names like Paychex (  ).The Android platform launch of RUN Powered by ADP follows the firm's highly successful first mobile payroll app for the iPhone platform in October 2010. The firm also plans to offer RUN Powered by ADP on Blackberry devices in the near future.According to a 2010 nationwide survey conducted by ADP Research Institute, small businesses are leading the trend toward increased mobility with the ability to schedule payroll runs on calendar, set up an appointment and run payroll on the day it is due.Trefis believes this push to mobile platforms will likely provide a boost to ADP's sales to small business clients, which have taken a hit in the past few years due to the economic recession.We currently expect the number of ADP's small business payroll clients to increase from as estimated 380K in 2010 to about 440K by the end of our forecast period. However, a faster growth in the number of small business payroll clients to 550K-600K during this period, driven by ADP's expansion to mobile platforms, would imply an upside of 3-4% to our  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADP Targets Small Business Clients through Android Payroll Platform@2011-05-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adp-targets-small-business-clients-through-android-payroll-platform-2011-05-29

"Shutterstock photoThe Dow Jones industrial Average (DJIA) faltered on Monday, but the blue chip barometer held support at the 10,800 level. The bulls' fortitude appears to have paid off this morning, as futures on the DJIA and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) are trading roughly 18 points and 1.4 points above fair value, respectively. With consumer confidence and housing prices indexes on tap later this morning, it appears that Wall Street is poised for a positive start to the session. Once again, look for support to emerge near 10,800 for the DJIA, with resistance lingering near 10,900. As for the SPX, short-term support may materialize near 1,140, with overhead resistance still unbroken at 1,150. On a final note, it's worth pointing out that the 21-day moving average on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (  ) equity-only, single-session put/call ratio is sitting at its lowest level since May 17. The last time this moving average was this low, the market was in a sharp downswing, practically the opposite of current conditions.In earnings news, Walgreen Co. (  ) said that its fourth-quarter earnings, excluding items, came in at 54 cents per share, as revenue rose to $16.9 billion. Analysts were looking for a profit of 44 cents per share. Looking ahead, Walgreen said it was ""confident"" that earnings would continue to grow.Elsewhere, Jabil Circuit (  ) reported a fourth-quarter profit of $112.1 million, or 52 cents per share, excluding items. Revenue was $3.9 billion for the quarter. Analysts had forecast Jabil to earn 48 cents per share on $3.67 billion in sales.Finally, Paychex Inc. (  ) reported first-quarter profit of $131.9 million, or 36 cents per share, on revenue of $518.3 million.

"e are seeing a ""tech renaissance"" right now, with many information technology, software and personal electronics companies seeing rapid share appreciation in the last 12 months.It's no secret why: As the world gets more wired, communications have become a necessity and gadgets once thought of as fads are now necessary parts of doing business in the 21st century. I, for one, couldn't imagine getting anything done without my trusty  (  ) iPhone and laptop with me 24/7.But this bullishness on the entire tech sector can be confusing for investors. Some technology stocks are getting a lot of hype that's deserved, but others are simply being lifted by a rising tide for technology firms right now.How can you tell the difference? Simple: Follow the fundamentals. My proprietary Portfolio Grader stock-ranking tool runs a fundamental analysis on the top 5,000 Wall Street companies every week. My team of analysts and I sift through the latest earnings forecasts, sales numbers, margin expansion percentages and a host of other figures. Our results are screened based on what's working best on Wall Street right now, and then Portfolio Grader outputs a rating for each company reflected as a simple letter grade, with A being ""strong buy"" and F being ""strong sell."" .

Futures on the DJIA and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) are trading roughly 6.7 points and 1 point above fair value, respectively, up from session lows. The Dow vaulted above potential support at the 10,800 level on Friday, closing just north of 10,850. This region should provide a backstop for the DJIA heading into the week. Meanwhile, resistance lies overhead in the 10,950-11,000 area. As for the SPX, the broad-market index faces a key technical hurdle right out of the gate this morning at the 1,150 level. Should the SPX overcome this area this morning, look for 1,150 to provide support. Otherwise, the index could remain trapped between 1,150 and 1,140 for most of the week.In merger and acquisition news, Southwest Airlines Co.

aychex (  ) competes primarily with ADP (  ) in the payroll processing market. Its profitability is strongly tied to the success of small businesses, which constitute the majority of its client base. We estimate that the payroll processing business generates nearly 70% of the  . Our price estimate is roughly 10% below market price.Paychex reported strong results for its fiscal Q2 2011 (ended November 30) and saw improvement in two key profit drivers - checks per client and revenue per check (Paychex fee per employee for clients). Underlying the encouraging results is an increase in average employees per payroll client by 2.5% year-over-year for fiscal Q2 2011 (up 1.8% through the first half of fiscal 2011). We note that the increase in revenue per check is consistent with a price increase implemented by Paychex in May 2010 and also reflects positive results due to decreases in discounting.Client retention also improved as client losses for the first half of fiscal 2011 were 12% lower than observed during the same period last year.While several economic indicators suggest that a recovery could be gaining momentum, U.S. employment numbers remain pressured. Consensus forecasts suggest that the unemployment date ended 2010 at just under 10%, and experts suggest that 9% by the end of 2011 is likely.Paychex is particularly sensitive to small business (1-49 employees) hiring, as these effectively represent the entirety of its client base. Through the prevailing economic recession, small businesses have seen fewer investors willing to contribute capital. Lending to small businesses from larger banks is down as well.As small businesses have struggled to weather the economic storm, the number of new hires in this segment has declined, weighing on Paychex's profitability. Despite recent reported gains in employees per Paychex client, we note that over-arching weakness in employment data could produce downside to our growth forecasts.We current forecast a 3% increase in Paychex's payroll clients by 2012. Similarly, we anticipate that the average number of employees per payroll client will increase nearly 4% during the same period. However, if recent trends continue to pressure small business operations and these two metrics show more moderate growth in the years ahead, there could be an estimated 10% downside to our Paychex stock price estimate.  , already stands about 10% below market price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Small Business Employment Struggles Could Outweigh Positive Earnings for Paychex@2011-01-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/small-business-employment-struggles-could-outweigh-positive-earnings-paychex-2011-01-07
" Sam Collins will be on vacation through June 25. Filling in for him are two other top technical analysts, Chris Johnson and Jon Lewis.The market couldn't be more fickle during the last few trading days as the bulls and bears are locked in a low-volatility game of ""chicken."" The benchmark indices finished the day mixed as the  (  ) finished higher, and the  (  ) and  (  ) ended the day lower.As has been the case all week, the major sectors were mixed, with five ending up and five down. The strongest sectors, relatively speaking, were the telecom (+0.6%), consumer staples (+0.3%) and materials (+0.1%).As sad as it is, the FOMC meeting results was the best chance that the market had to grab a catalyst to rally today, though we will see some actionable reports tomorrow before the open as we'll get a look at durable goods orders (consensus expects -1.3%), durable goods orders ex-transportation (consensus expects 1.3%), initial unemployment claims (consensus expects 460,000) and continuing unemployment claims (consensus expects 458,000).With market sentiment taking a negative tone, a mix of in-line reports would be enough to get this market to poke back above the critical technicals it recently dipped below. In case that's not the outcome tomorrow, let's look at the likely downside scenario.The SPX failed to move back above the psychologically and technically significant 1,100 point today, increasing the odds that a trip back to the 1,050 level (some 12% below today's close) may be in the cards. These odds are now on the rise as a few of the pre-earnings season reports are hitting the tape, with little to be bullish on.After Wednesday's close,  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) were trading lower on earnings results. Not a good start to the pre-season reports. We expect to see an increase in the pre-season announcements next week, adding to the volume and volatility in the market.OK, so where does this market appear to be headed? Well, the downside risks are now growing, which means that the options traders in the crowd should be considering some put protection.What do I mean by that? Well, by purchasing puts on the  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NYSE:  ) shares we can effectively hedge a portfolio against market declines over the short run.In today's case, I would suggest that options traders look to leverage the potential 10% decline in the S&P 500 over the next few weeks by purchasing the  (  ), which closed the trading session on Wednesday at $1.84. This option would provide a degree of leveraged protection against a move by the SPX to the 1,050 or lower levels.We're starting to prepare for the worst, while trying to expect something better. On that last point, it is not out of the possible outcomes that we could see the SPX break back above the 1,100 point tomorrow, which would excite the sideline buyers. This backs up our perspective of the current technical picture as ""trading in no man's land"" for now.The bottom line is that we need a decisive move, to the upside or downside, over the next few days to provide the indication of whether the next 10% move in the market will be higher or lower. Tomorrow may be the day to provide this directional move.We're certainly standing at the ready to initiate a new string of option positions to benefit from the impending move in stocks. We'll do our best to keep you under our wing as we open these new positions.

"he short seller is the one trader most investors love to hate. Often misunderstood and maligned, the short seller bets prices will fall rather than rise. This doesn't earn the short seller much popularity with most investors (who usually buy a stock hoping it will rise), but it can be a very profitable strategy.Here's how it works: A short seller thinks a stock's price will fall, so he borrows shares from a broker. He then immediately sells those shares and gets the cash from the sale. At this point, the trader officially has a ""short"" position in the stock. If the trader is right and the share price falls, he must decide when to buy back the shares at the lower price and return them to the broker. When he does that, the trader pockets the difference from when he originally sold the shares.If enough short sellers pile on against a stock that's declining, prices can be significantly pushed downward. On the flip side, if short sellers are wrong and a stock begins to rise, a beautiful thing happens for all the ""longs"" (investors who buy a stock and expect its price to rise) -- short sellers begin to ""cover,"" or buy back their shares. If the stock stages a significant rally, it can create panic buying by shorts, causing what is known as a ""short squeeze.""Profiting from this ""short squeeze"" is the focus of today's ""Inside the Numbers"" column.Before we look for stocks that could benefit from a short squeeze, it's important to understand a key metric -- the short interest ratio . This is found by dividing the total number of shares being shorted by the average daily volume of shares traded.For example, if a company has two million shares short and an average daily volume of one million shares, then the short interest ratio is two (2 million / 1 million = 2), meaning it would take two average days of trading for all the shorts to cover. Therefore, a stock with a ratio of, say, eight, would mean that it would take six more days for shorts to cover than a stock with a short interest ratio of two. But it also means that if a short squeeze does occur, the rally could be much stronger.Still with me? Good. Now on to this week's screen…I recently asked the StreetAuthority research team to look for companies that could experience a short squeeze in the months ahead. In order to qualify as candidates, they must not only have an unusually high short interest ratio, but also be profitable with good long-term growth prospects. Here are the criteria we used:-- Short interest ratio greater than 7-- Profitable earnings per share (  ) on a trailing twelve-month basis-- Long-term estimated growth of at least +8%-- Operating margins of at least 15%Here's what turned up:A few interesting things to note about our list:The shorts have had their way lately: at a price of slightly more than $110 a share, First Solar is trading -85% below its 52-week high. First Solar has been beaten up so much lately, in fact, that it's incredibly cheap. Shares currently change hands for 14.4 times earnings -- you would have had to pay an average multiple of 52 during the past two years. First Solar is expected to grow earnings at a +24% clip in the years ahead, yet investors are only paying 17 times estimated earnings. Without a doubt, First Solar looks to be the best short squeeze candidate of the bunch.Brad Briggs Staff Writer StreetAuthorityBrad BriggsStaff WriterStreetAuthorityIf you'd rather profit from a straight up short, you need to check out this week's issue of Double-Digit Trading.

he number of near-term puts on the tape in  is on the rise out of the gate on Monday following negative news that the payroll company's chief executive officer resigned. The September 25-strike puts are active during morning trading thanks to investors calling for downside during the next few months.By 9:40 a.m. EST, more than 7,200 September 25 puts had changed hands for an average price of roughly $1 per contract, which was at the ask price when the majority of the volume hit the tape. The earliest block that traded changed hands for 90 cents per contract and the most recent block traded for $1 per contract, indicating buying action pushed up the price of these near-the-money puts. Current open interest in the September 25-strike puts is 1,900 contracts. Investors who opened long put positions will make money on this bearish trade if PAYX shares are trading lower than $24 at September options expiration. If PAYX drops at least 7% during the next three months and dips below the breakeven price, these put buyers could choose to sell back the options and take profits instead of holding them until expiration. Maximum profit on this long put trade is $24 in the unlikely event that PAYX shares are trading at zero at September 17. Maximum loss, which occurs if PAYX is still trading higher than $25 at expiration, is the premium paid per contract.PAYX shares dropped more than 1% to $26 during morning trading and are currently just 9% higher than their 52-week low of roughly $23. The company said it has immediately begun a search for a new CEO after former President Jonathan Judge announced plans to leave the company at the end of the month to pursue personal interests. On June 23, the company announced earnings of 32 cents per share, which beat estimates by one cent. The market expects PAYX's next earnings announcement around September 23.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Paychex (PAYX) CEO resignation sparks bearishness@2010-07-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paychex-payx-ceo-resignation-sparks-bearishness-2010-07-15
"ost businesses hate to see rising interest rates. Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. Not every business though. This company welcomes and profits from increases in interest rates. collects payroll for its clients' employees, and sits on the money for a while before disbursing it to its rightful owners on payday. During this lag time, the company is free to invest that cash on its own behalf -- much like  puts its insurance ""float "" to good use.Paychex basically gets to invest with free money.Unfortunately, abysmally low interest rates have eaten away at the interest income from these short-term investments. During fiscal 2009, the company's $3.3 billion portfolio of AAA-rated government agency bonds generated a yield of 2.2%, resulting in interest income of about $75 million. That's a steep -43% drop from what it earned in 2008 thanks to an unprecedented low federal funds rate of 0.25%.Before the financial crisis hit, rates were sitting at lofty levels above 5.0%. With the economy back on its feet and inflationary pressures looming, rates should begin marching higher in the second half of 2011 -- potentially doubling that $75 million in interest income to $150 million in just 18 months.That's just icing on the cake for Paychex.Every day, millions of workers receive their wages, either via paycheck or direct deposit. The process may seem simple and straightforward, but there's more to it than meets the eye. Time sheets may need to be validated, payroll taxes have to be calculated, and deductions for health care premiums and retirement account contributions must be withheld.Crunching the numbers and making sure employees are promptly and accurately paid can be an expensive and time-consuming undertaking. That's where Paychex comes in. The firm handles these outsourced operations for 540,000 businesses around the world -- reducing expenses, eliminating bookkeeping headaches, and giving companies more time to do whatever they do best.There's another reason to love Paychex -- it holds the cards in negotiations. These smaller businesses, representing 98% of Paychex's client base, have little negotiating power and are conditioned to annual price increases. There is usually little incentive to switch vendors -- which gives Paychex a very sticky customer base.And there's still plenty of business for Paychex to capture. Only 10% of the estimated 11.5 million businesses located where Paychex operates outsource their payroll.As you might expect, the moribund labor market has dampened the firm's growth prospects lately. Last year, the number of clients from new business fell -19%, while the number lost to companies going out of business rose by a similar percentage.Even under these difficult economic conditions, Paychex managed to grow revenue (albeit by just +1%) and produce record operating income, while dishing out 85% of its profits as dividends.Nathan SlaughterEditor: Market Advisor, The ETF AuthorityP.S.

"he most valued company in the United States? If you guess  or  or  , you're way off. Hint: This company been around since 1851 and does business in nearly every town in the world. Another hint: A band called The Five Americans made it the subject of a hit song in 1967.The biggest company in the United States by revenue, earnings and market cap is ExxonMobil. But even Exxon's No. 1 position in the petroleum world doesn't make it the most valued business in the United States.That honor belongs, believe it or not, to  . Though the company's market cap is only equal to about two weeks of Exxon's revenue, its underlying financial-services business -- the one that helps people send cash around the world -- is valued more richly than Exxon's oil exploration and production activities, lucrative though they are.In this case, ""richly"" is determined by calculating net asset value and comparing it with market capitalization. That might sound complicated, but it's not. Here's how it works out in three easy steps.1) Add up the company's assets -- anything that has value.2) Subtract every debt. The resulting net asset value is known as ""shareholder equity."" You'll find shareholder equity on every balance sheet in the world. It's the part of the company that belongs to the owners free and clear, just like the equity in your house.3) Divide market cap by shareholder equity. If the number is 1.0 or less, investors can buy the company for less than the value of the company's net assets. Anything above 1.0 is the value of the company's underlying business. It's the premium investors pay to own the future of a retail store, the oil business, or the soft-drink industry - whatever the sector.In most cases, companies trade at a multiple of book value. That makes sense, of course, as a company certainly should be worth far more than merely the value of its headquarters, desks and inventories. The S&P 500 index, in fact, trades at an aggregate 2.21 times book value. In other words, if you take the average company in the S&P and multiply its book value by 2.21, you'll get its market cap.Western Union trades at 41 times the value of its net assets.Which brings us to an important point: There are lies, damned lies, and statistics. The only reason Western Union trades at such a steep premium is that it has almost no shareholder equity. Its balance sheet shows $6.2 billion in assets but only $327 million in equity. As things stand, Western Union's market cap is currently about $13 billion.The question, of course, is why Western Union's market value hasn't fallen. If it were an ""average"" S&P company, after all, it would be trading at 2.21 times its equity, or $722 million, not even enough to merit it a spot on the benchmark index.The answer is that investors are humans, not computers, and the market is not an efficient or accurate processor of information. Western Union's price didn't fall because investors really do place a high value on its business, which it will use to boost its balance sheet by either growing its assets or reducing its debt, or both. When that happens, its price-to-book ratio will happily regress to the mean.Here is the list of the most valuable U.S. businesses. This screen omits companies worth less than $10 billion. Except for  ,  ,  and perhaps  , these are all defensive, countercyclical companies that will have customers in nearly any economic climate.Company (Ticker)Market CapP/BPriceP/ETotal Return YTD Western Union (  )$13.3B40.7$19.6714.4+37.2%Lorillard(  )$12.6B33.2$79.1913.6+46.7%Yum Brands (  )$16.6B18.4$35.9116.6+16.9%Campbell Soup (  )$11.7B16.0$33.7715.3+15.4%Amazon(Nasdaq: AMZN)$55.8B15.6$131.2975.8+156.0%Phillip Morris (  )$95.8B15.2$50.5215.6+20.7%Colgate(  )$41.7B15.0$85.8720.2+28.5%Avon(  )$14.6B13.9$35.3020.7+51.5%Kellogg(  )$20.0B10.9$53.3416.1+24.7%Altria(  )$39.7B10.7$19.3011.0+35.7%Mastercard (  )$30.3B9.4$227.2821.4+59.6%IBM(  )$166.4B9.0$128.1513.1+55.3%Lockheed Martin (  )$28.4B9.0$75.3610.0-8.3%Paychex(Nasdaq: PAYX)$11.2B8.2$31.3122.0+24.7%UPS(  )$56.7B8.1$57.3723.9+7.8%Heinz(  )$13.2B8.1$42.4815.1+17.0%Southern Copper (  )$29.4B8.0$35.2865.1+124.1%Are these stocks good investments? I'd be a proud owner of any of these shares except  . All but Lockheed have seen a positive return year-to-date, and 65% of these companies have beaten the S&P so far this year.The biggest winners have been Amazon, +156%, and Southern Copper, +124%. Amazon and Southern Copper trade at not only a rich premium to book but also at a steep P/E ratio: AMZN sells for 76 times earnings, Southern Copper for 65. That strikes me as far too rich, given tepid demand for both copper and the prospects for the upcoming holiday shopping season, which is expected to underwhelm.Of the companies with a positive return for the year, the best values, that is, the lowest earnings multiples, are  (11), IBM (13) and  (13).Western Union -- whose price/book is likely to fall -- is attractively valued at only 14.4 times earnings. Western Union's assets may be worth a pricey 18.4 times the S&P's net asset value, but WU's earnings can be had at a -34.5% discount to the index.Companies with good businesses command a high book value. When those companies can be purchased at a fair price, it's a good profit opportunity for long-term investors.So with that in mind, can you guess which of the companies mentioned in the introduction have the highest price-to-book ratio?Times are never too tough for a Coke. So if you said Coca-Cola, you're right.(Coca-Cola, 5.5, Berkshire, 1.3, Exxon, 3.3)So have a Coke and a smile and enjoy this oldie.Andy ObermuellerEditor, Government-Driven InvestingDisclosure: Andy Obermueller does not own shares of any security mentioned in this article.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The Most Valuable Business in the United States@2009-11-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/most-valuable-business-united-states-2009-11-20
