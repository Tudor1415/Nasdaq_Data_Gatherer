We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products,\r\nwhich are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip\r\ndesigns rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and\r\nhardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the\r\nsoftware that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical\r\nservices and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic\r\nsystems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System\r\nDesign segment.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f12%2f20%2f0000883241-19-000019.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Aart J. de Geus", "title": "Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer"}, {"name": "Chi-Foon Chan", "title": "President, Co-Chief Executive Officer & Director"}, {"name": "Hasmukh Ranjan", "title": "Chief Information Officer & Corporate VP"}, {"name": "Trac Pham", "title": "Chief Financial Officer"}]}
