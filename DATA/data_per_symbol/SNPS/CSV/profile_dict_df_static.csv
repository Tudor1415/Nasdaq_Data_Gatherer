software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software
developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code.

We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA)
software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also
known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products,
which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip
designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and
hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the
software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical
services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic
systems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System
Design segment.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=""http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2019%2f12%2f20%2f0000883241-19-000019.html#FIS_BUSINESS"" target=""_blank"">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
