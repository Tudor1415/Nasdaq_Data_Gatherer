"y Josh HorwitzThe latest U.S. government action against China's Huawei takes direct aim the company's HiSilicon chip division--a business that in a few short years has become central to China's ambitions in semiconductor technology but will now lose access to tools that are central to its success.That could make it the most damaging U.S. attack yet against a Chinese company that U.S. officials told reporters Wednesday functioned as a ""tool of strategic influence"" for the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  for its part denounced the U.S. allegations and called the new measures ""arbitrary and pernicious."" Established in 2004, HiSilicon develops chips mostly for Huawei, and for most of its existence has been an afterthought in a global chip business dominated by U.S., Korean and Japanese companies. Like most electronics firms, Huawei relied on others for the chips that powered its equipment.But heavy investment in research and development helped drive rapid progress at HiSilicon, and in recent years the 7,000-employee unit has been central to Huawei's rise as a dominant player in the global smartphone business and the emerging 5G telecom networking business.HiSilicon's Kirin smartphone processor is now considered to be on par with those created by Apple Inc  and Qualcomm Inc  --a rare example of an advanced Chinese semiconductor product that competes globally.HiSilicon is also central to Huawei's leadership in 5G, stepping into the breach when the United States cut off access to some U.S. chips last year. In March, Huawei revealed that 8% of the 50,000 5G base stations it sold in 2019 came with no U.S. technology, using HiSilicon chipsets instead.But the U.S. export control rule, first reported by Reuters last week, aims to block HiSilicon's access to two crucial tools: chip design software from U.S. firms including Cadence Design Systems Inc  and Synopsys Inc , and the manufacturing prowess of ""foundries,"" led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd , that build chips for many of the world's top semiconductor firms. With the new restrictions，HiSilicon ""will be in a situation where they’re not able to manufacture chips at all, or if they do, then they’re not leading edge anymore,"" says Stewart Randall, who tracks China's chip industry at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink.Without its own processors, Huawei will lose its edge over domestic smartphone rivals, analysts said. International sales had already been gutted by a ban on the use of key Google software.Industry sources say Huawei has stockpiled chips, and the new U.S. rule will not go into full force for 120 days. U.S. officials also note that licenses could be granted for some technologies. HiSilicon can also keep using design software it has already acquired.Still, analysts agree HiSilicon is in a tough spot. Nearly all chip factories globally -- including China's leading foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp  -- buy gear from the same equipment makers, led by U.S. firms Applied Materials Inc , Lam Research Corp  and KLA Corp .The new U.S. rule requires licenses for companies using U.S. machinery to build Huawei-designed chips and delivered to the Chinese firm. To be sure, the new rule will not catch items shipped to a third party, allowing HiSilicon's fabricators like TSMC the ability to ship chips to HiSilicon’s device manufacturers who can send them directly to a customer.While there are alternatives to American machines - Japan's Tokyo Electron Ltd , for example, makes gear that competes with Applied Materials - replacing U.S. technology is not as simple as swapping out a machine.“You almost have to think about it like a heart transplant,"" said VLSI Research Chief Executive Dan Hutcheson, noting that chip production lines are finely calibrated systems where everything has to work well together.Doug Fuller of the Chinese University of Hong Kong said Huawei had a few options. It could slip around the rule by having suppliers ship directly to Huawei customers, though the U.S. officials said they would be vigilant about such workarounds.Huawei and the Chinese government could re-double efforts to build production capabilities that did not require U.S. tools, by investing in nascent Chinese competitors and buying from Japanese and Korean firms, even if that required quality sacrifices.Or Huawei could turn away from HiSilicon and revert to buying from overseas suppliers--just not American ones. ""There’s talk of Huawei just turning to Samsung processors,"" for its smartphone, said Fuller.U.S. regulators open door to possible tightening of Huawei chip curbHuawei calls U.S. move to curb chips supply 'arbitrary', expects business impactU.S. moves to cut Huawei off from global chip suppliers as China eyes retaliationEXCLUSIVE-U.S. weighs new regulations to further restrict Huawei suppliers - sourcesEXCLUSIVE-U.S. prepares crackdown on Huawei's global chip supply -sources(Reporting by Josh Horwitz in Shanghai; Additional reporting by David Kirton in Shenzhen and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Lisa Shumaker)((; +86 21 20830007;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@ANALYSIS-U.S. strikes at a Huawei prize: chip juggernaut HiSilicon@2020-05-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-u.s.-strikes-at-a-huawei-prize%3A-chip-juggernaut-hisilicon-2020-05-21

There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Synopsys Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $150.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $209.00.  The standard deviation is $16.207.


But the whole reason to look at the average SNPS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with SNPS crossing above that average target price of $186.09/share, investors in SNPS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $186.09 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Synopsys Inc:

Please forgive any delays technology glitches or awkward hand-offs in the Q&A session as we navigate this new virtual dynamic. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I'm happy to report outstanding second quarter results with record orders revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow. We substantially exceeded all of our key guidance metrics. Revenue was $861 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 and non-GAAP earnings of $1.22. Orders were substantially greater than our internal plan, driven primarily by digital design software and we continue to make good progress on our margin expansion goals. As a result of our first half strength and the resilience of our business, we are reaffirming our revenue and non-GAAP margin guidance for the year, while raising our non-GAAP earnings and cash flow targets. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.Before providing quarterly highlights, let me comment on the market landscape, which is, of course, dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its substantial recessionary pressure on the global economy. While in a matter of weeks, many companies around the world have adopted to widespread work-from-home, the semiconductor sector has stayed busy as electronic system and system design continues unabated. Driven by the sudden need for bandwidth and compute-for-home, be it for work, schooling, or entertainment, advanced chip design is not slowing down. We've seen this continuous design activity in previous downturns. Regardless of where a company or industry is in its business cycle, continuous investment in new technologies, be they AI and machine learning, 5G, IoT, automotive or cloud end markets, is the best way to be ready when the economy turns up again. Synopsys is at the core of this enablement. Combining that with our time-based business model, higher level of recurring revenue and a non-cancelable backlog of $4.8 billion, Synopsys is well-positioned to withstand the uncertainties of today's macro environment.With that context, let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. Our unrelenting innovation push throughout our Fusion Design Platform is driving momentum in technical benchmark wins, increased competitive displacements, and new breakthrough products. In Q2, our hallmark Fusion Compiler product drove a doubling of the number of tape-outs, as well as significant business commitments by customers ranging from the world's largest microprocessor and consumer companies to mobile networking and automotive system designers. Key competitive wins included a leading Asian 5G Edge computing chip supplier for next generation 5-nanometer design, a prominent North American graphics company on the advanced gaming GPU and expanding competitive displacements at some of the world's leading mobile semis on multiple designs ranging from 12-nanometer to 5-nanometer.The Fusion concept, a revolutionary invention, was impacted but goes far beyond even the breakthrough Fusion Compiler solution, resonates very well with our customers and partners. This quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Broadcom, who is widely deploying our Fusion Design Platform to accelerate delivery of its innovative 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer designs. And our innovation continues at a rapid pace.In March, we announced several exciting new products including DSO.ai, the result of a multi-year initiative with leading industry partners. It includes learning engines that can automatically adjust and optimize throughout the design flow. The result is impressive productivity improvements in terms of project time, as well as further optimizations in chip performance, power and area. Using state-of-the-art AI and machine learning, as well as a cloud-based burst computation, it enables design teams to tackle more projects, handle larger parts of a project and let's designers focus exclusively on leverage high creativity and value-added tasks.Another similar new product is 3DIC Compiler. Advanced designs are now so massive and complex that they require a brand new approach. 3DIC Compiler is a single environment that enables the combination of multiple die together on a chip. This provides far better performance and capacity than conventional chip and package approaches for customers such as Samsung Electronics, who refer to it as an industry disruptor. 3DIC is also a great way to extend the power, performance, and density benefits of Moore's law as it supports the high-speed, parallelism and massive data needs of new AI architectures. This opens a new path to very powerful multi-die computational engines for years to come.Meanwhile, in custom design, our multi-year innovation push has resulted in a highly competitive product that is being used for the most advanced FinFET designs and driving ongoing, full-flow competitive displacements. For example, Alphawave replaced its legacy custom designed tools with our Custom Design Platform for development of high-speed connectivity IP. Here too, productivity was the reward, as our solution help them meet aggressive design targets in a notably shorter timeframe.A major foundry in Asia expanded its internal deployment and now have more than 10 Custom Compiler projects under way. We also secured new deployments for memory, silicon IP and microprocessor designs.Let me now move to our Verification Continuum Platform, where significant technology innovation continues to cement our market share leadership. In Verification Software, we're seeing notable expansions at influential hyperscale companies, traditional semi and systems companies and global start-ups. Across the platform, our technology is strong. On the hardware side of our Verification Solution, which caters uniquely to unrelenting design complexity growth, demand for our products is also high. Competitively, our emulators and prototyping systems are differentiated by a raw speed, high reliability, easier installation and maintenance and overall lower cost of ownership.Just this quarter, 13 new customers purchased our hardware products, and we have more than 30 repeat orders. Here too we're seeing good momentum with customers ranging from very large semi and systems companies to hyperscalers and start-ups. While the timing of hardware deliveries creates a tough comparison with the first half of last year, we continue to gain momentum with both new and existing customers.Now to IP, where we are growing with solid momentum. As the Number 1 provider of interphase embedded memory, logic libraries, and foundry specific IP, we provide the broadest portfolio, addressing the most complex requirements, accelerating time to market and lowering design risks. With more than 330 wins for foundry specific 7-nanometer IP, customers are clearly placing their trust in our leadership in high-performance cloud computing applications.Most recently, we achieved significant competitive wins, including a major internet services and AI company, who adopted our production proven IP Subsystems and PCI Express 5.0 and a major Taiwanese fabless semiconductor company who licensed our silicon proven HBM2E for multiple networking customers. Our unrelenting focus on enabling advanced process designs continues. We announced availability of the broadest portfolio of IP for TSMC's 5-nanometer process for high performance computing SOCs. A multinational technology giant in cloud services and AI selected our PCI Express 5.0, CXL and foundation IP. And a leading e-commerce company chose our Die-to-Die HPY [PHY] IP because of our performance, power and area differentiation.Our product momentum for our processors also continued with the introduction of our first 64-bit processor IP. This is our highest performance ARC processor today targeting high-end embedded applications such as storage, automotive control and infotainment.Now to Software Integrity. This is one area of our business that felt more of an impact from COVID as companies delayed business decisions while working to adapt to shelter-in-place mandates. While revenue growth improved sequentially, we did see a slowdown in orders that will moderate our revenue growth this year to the low-double-digit range before returning to higher growth longer term. The breadth and roadmap of our portfolio are uniquely well-suited to serve today's desk-tech ops requirements. By providing high-value products, a great new platform and strategic consulting services, we are well-positioned to help companies develop more secure, high-quality software for a very interconnected world.Industry recognition of our vision and product breadth have grown significantly over the past several years. Just a few weeks ago, Gartner updated its Magic Quadrant for application security testing. We are pleased to note that Synopsys is again at the furthest top right position in the leader quadrant.We made progress during this quarter in several areas. We achieved multiple competitive displacements as customers embraced the benefit of our broad portfolio and the integration onto the Polaris Software Integrity Platform. We saw notable broadening of agreements as customers expanded the number of products they adopt. One example is a very large global electronics company, who replaced the incumbent and significantly expanded its adoption to a broader set of our solutions. This quarter, our customer base continue to grow with new logos ranging from very well-known consumer electronics leaders to hyperscalers to industrial and financial services company. Our next objective is to scale this business to reach $500 million to $1 billion in revenue over time.Before I hand it over to Trac, let me comment on our practical handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll begin with a sincere thank you to the many selfless caregivers, who keep us safe. I also want to thank our employees who have shown incredible commitment and agility over the past several months to execute on the dual objectives of health and business. I believe that our execution during this period has been stellar. In addition to the rapid actions we took to implement global shelter-in-place orders, we continue to partner with our peers, local governments, and health agencies to ensure a safe work environment for those returning to the office. Our IT, HR facilities and operations teams have done an amazing job quickly adapting our infrastructure and systems to support work-from-home. Our R&D teams continue to execute very well and have effectively worked through some hardware supply chain and logical challenges. The large number of new products and excellent benchmark results give us strong confidence in our product pipeline.This also applies to our worldwide IP team, which had the foresight to rapidly enable remote development and delivery of high-demand advanced titles. We are able to ship our products at our customers [Technical Issues] we support from our application engineering teams. Last, as witnessed by the strongest orders quarter on record, our sales team also demonstrated stellar execution. As we now see a gradual opening of businesses in many countries and states, our leadership is planning a very gradual shift back to the office in coordination with local authorities and sensitive to our employees well-being.In closing, Synopsys is executing well. We delivered outstanding second quarter results with record orders revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow. Design activity remains strong and enduring. We continue to introduce innovative new products throughout our portfolio and are benchmarking strongly. Notwithstanding the extraordinary world circumstances, we continue to target high-single-digit revenue growth, substantial ops margin expansion, mid-teens non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth, and strong operating cash flow. Trac will now highlight the financial perspective. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Our record results are especially noteworthy in light of the considerable challenges faced by ourselves and our customers over the past few months. Given our history of strong execution, sometimes it's easier to forget how much hard work goes into delivering results like these. So I'd like to add my thanks to our employees for their dedication under these difficult circumstances.Complementing our excellent execution in the first half is our very solid business foundation, technology leadership, a diverse customer base and nearly 90% recurring revenue. These elements position us well for periods of high demand, as well as during times of greatest stress. This rare combination gives us the confidence to reaffirm our annual revenue and non-GAAP margin guidance and to increase our non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow targets.Now to our second quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year, unless otherwise stated. Orders substantially exceeded our plan, driven in large part by EDA, particularly digital design. Ending backlog was $4.7 billion. We generated total revenue of $861.3 million above our target range, driven by broad strength and some revenue that moved in from Q3. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $773 million with strong growth in EDA software, moderated by a tough hardware comparison over a strong Q2 of last year. Excluding hardware, EDA software results remain within our long term target range of mid-to-high single-digits.A quick note on hardware. While COVID-19 has presented some minor HAPs-related supply chain challenges due to shelter-in-place mandates, we're managing through them well. Our contract manufacturing partners are gradually increasing capacity and because our products are considered essential, they are top priorities. Software Integrity segment revenue was $88.3 million, 10% of total.Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $735 million, which includes approximately $30 million in restructuring costs associated with our previously communicated program to optimize resource allocation for sustainable long term growth. These are not COVID-related. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $640 million resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.7%. We are on track to generate approximately 2 percentage points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion for the year. Adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design segment was 27.1% and for the Software Integrity segment, 13.3%. Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $0.71 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.22, well above our target range due to excellent operational execution.Turning to cash, we generated a record $380 million in operating cash flow. We initiated a $100 million ASR and have now completed $200 million in buybacks year-to-date. We've repurchased $2 billion of our stock since 2015, approximately 75% of our free cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy has not changed. We'll continue to evaluate the best use of cash each quarter and we will remain prudent as the global macro environment evolves. Our balance sheet is very strong. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $856 million and total debt of $236 million as we paid down $90 million of our revolver.Now to guidance, which continues to assume that the current Entity List restrictions remain in place for the rest of the year. Consistent with our expectations, revenue is skewed to later in the year, due primarily to a scheduled timing of hardware and IP deliveries. For fiscal year 2020, our targets are: revenue of $3.6 billion to 3.65 billion, total GAAP cost and expenses between $2.99 billion and $3.03 billion, total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $2.63 billion and $2.66 billion resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%, GAAP earnings of $3.74 to $3.90 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $5.21 to $5.28 per share, cash flow from operations of $815 million to $840 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $170 million.Now to the targets for the third quarter: revenue between $875 million and $905 million, total GAAP cost and expenses between $721 million and $737 million, total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $640 million and $650 million, GAAP earnings of $1.12 to $1.20 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $1.33 to $1.38 per share.In conclusion, despite the unprecedented challenges faced by our employees and customers around the globe, our focused execution, portfolio strength and resilient business model enabled us to deliver a very strong quarter, reiterate our full year revenue and non-GAAP margin guidance and raise our non-GAAP earnings and cash flow targets. Our strong balance sheet and thoughtful approach to capital allocation, position us well to navigate the current environment. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thank you and congrats to the team on delivering very solid results in a challenging environment. First, just on the order commentary, I think you said you saw stronger than expected orders primarily in core EDA. I was wondering if you could give any color on sort of what drove that strength and if you thought it was maybe timing related, or if you think that was sort of a net increase in demand, relative to your original plan. -- Well, I think there are multiple things that played and all at the same time. Obviously, in a time like this, we all pay a lot of attention to execution, and so we'll get some credit for just working hard at it. But I think the other thing that happened is that a number of the new products that we introduced last year, and some that we announced just recently, are very attractive and benchmark extremely well. And so the hunger for more sophisticated products continues because during the same timeframe, what we're seeing is that a number of the advanced customers are moving now from 7-nanometer to 5-nanometer. And so that has both implications on the IP that they're using and on the strength of tools that they want. And so the demand, I think, was absolutely there and it was for us to make sure that we find a way to get at it. -- Got it. Just one more on the SIG business. One, could you say what the bookings were there? I know they were pretty good last quarter, despite the relatively modest revenue growth. And two, any progress on getting a business unit -- a new business unit head there? Thanks. -- So, we normally don't disclose the bookings for any sub part of the company. We did communicate that they were lower this quarter than expected and therefore that has some ramifications going forward. It's not completely a surprise because a lot of the interactions early on in the COVID time were very impacted by people essentially hustling for shelter-from-home. On the recruiting, we have started a search and so we expect that in the next six months, this will be fulfilled and now we're looking at candidates. -- Got it. Thanks very much, Aart, and congrats again on a nice quarter. -- You're welcome. Thank you very much, Rich.Next, we turn to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, good afternoon. Maybe first a question on the hardware business. At this point, is that completely outsourced or do you still do or do you do a final assembly and test in-house? And just curious if COVID was a bigger issue for your suppliers or for your own internal assembly and test? -- Well, it's an excellent question. So we do a little bit of all of that. We outsource, obviously as much as we possibly can. There are -- depending on what the status is of the hardware, we assemble some of it ourselves. And as you would expect, when you have a global disruption of all the markets, initially, you have to watch out where all the parts are coming from, who is doing the assembly, etc, and the issues that we looked at initially were HAPs-related. I'm quite impressed by how quickly our team was on top of that. And after that, the fact that this is essential equipment benefited us as the assembly people we work with gave us high priority. And so I think the problem is mostly resolved at this point in time. -- Okay, that's great to hear. And then Trac, when I look at the midpoint of guidance for, I guess, the third and the implied for the fourth quarter, pretty strong revenue growth, not a lot of model leverage off that revenue growth there. I' m curious, is that because it's more hardware-centric, is it conservatism or is there something else going on? -- It is a little bit of the hardware mix. You got COGS ramping up with expenses as well. And the profile is that it does have some additional expenses in terms of hiring. But I do expect that you'll see an improvement in operating margins from Q3 to Q4. -- Okay, Sounds good, thank you. -- You're welcome.Next we turn to the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead. -- Hi, great. Hello, everyone. Apologies if this came out, I joined a little bit late, but just a current events question. I'm wondering if the recent proposals around new export restrictions have either impacted Synopsys any way or maybe since the April quarter closed, caused some of your customers maybe to reconsider certain spending decisions or just any impacts from the past couple of weeks and some of the news that's been coming out? -- Well, the bottom line of the answer is no. The recent announcements were one or two weeks old and while fairly complicated, we were able to get a good sense of it and our conclusion is it does not affect us beyond what is already prohibited in the entity. We have also not had any follow-on of customers that were worried in any form. So I think that interpretation has been fairly universal. -- Okay, great. And then on Software Integrity, I guess the qualitative commentary just in terms of some of the buy in to Polaris and the fact that you're getting competitive displacements for Polaris at this point, that strikes me as pretty positive. So I guess my question is, did it surprise you to have platform traction in a more difficult environment created by COVID and does that give you maybe some optimism in thinking about bookings for the back half of your year? -- Well, you know we live with optimism and actually that was a good example of it because the whole point of a platform is to get the benefit of multiple tools that work well together. And, by the way, for the buyer, it has another benefit, especially for larger companies. They are trying to maintain an environment that is not overly complex with tools from many, many different vendors. And so being able to bring multiple capabilities together in a structured fashion, that over time, will gain more and more value, because things work well together, is actually precisely the direction that we are counting on, and the fact that a number of customers have actually bought Synopsys precisely for that reason is extremely encouraging. -- Great, thank you very much. -- You're welcome, Joe.And next, we turn to the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus a little bit on the -- hello, can you hear me? -- Yeah, we can hear you. -- Yes, right. I just wanted to focus a bit on the operating margin here. So the implied number, it looks like you guys are going to get to that kind of the high-20s exiting the year. So I really have two parts to my questions. The first one is just that, is that correct that you're going to kind of exit at 29%? And then secondly, does that imply that '21 should actually be better than your high -20s target because now you guys kind of get a work-from-home dynamic, you don't have as much T&E expense? It's something we've heard that a lot of companies, particularly, software companies are able to do. So is there any way you guys are going to be able to squeeze extra basis points out of the opex line going forward? -- Let me work backwards on your question, Mitch. You're right, We are -- we will be exiting in the high-20s for the year, but keep in mind that it's largely a profile of the revenue ramp. We remain committed to our long term goals of driving margin expansion, but at this point, it's too early to talk about FY '21. We'll cover that later in the year. As far as savings from COVID, certainly, we're seeing some element of that flow through -- that benefit flow through to the results. But, you know, the results are largely driven by us executing the plan that we set out to do for the year, which is continue to focus on our spending, be more diligent about where we're investing and driving a plan that's going to deliver good margin growth this year and over time. -- Got it. And then just one small one, if I could, and I'll ask multiple questions. So just -- was there any revenue impact you guys could quantify in terms of what the hardware shipments would have been or if you had any push outs in terms of sales because I'm curious why the full year guide didn't go out, though, I would think that you'd be able to get at least about -- toward the high end, I guess, of the revenue guide? So was there any sort of push out or anything related to COVID in the quarter? -- No, not really. COVID had a really small effect on the results -- were immaterial effect on the financial results. As we mentioned, we had a -- some initial challenges with the supply chain when the shelter-in-place mandates went into effect, but we were able to overcome that and execute on the numbers for the quarter. Good execution in Q2, results were strong and it's on, but we did see some revenues move in from Q3 to Q2. At this point, we're providing our best view of the outlook for hardware and it really reflects a profile of it growing in Q4. And so far, we feel confident in our ability to execute to that. That's why we're reaffirming the guidance. -- Understood. Thank you. -- You're welcome.And next, we turn to the line of Jackson Ader with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks for taking my questions, guys. The first one to Aart is a follow-up actually on some of the trade restrictions. You addressed, I think, the Entity List and Huawei's, I guess, tighter restrictions, having already been factored in, but what about the military end user or military end use case, I guess, control actions that were put out at the end of April? Do you expect any impact from that? -- No, we don't. So fundamentally, the guidance that we have given you encompasses all of our interpretation of all of the various actions that have been taken over the last year and a half. And I think we feel very solid in that interpretation at this point in time. -- Okay, all right, great. Thank you. -- You're welcome. -- And then follow on for Trac. Yeah, just quickly on cash flow. So are customers -- or there is any customers either in Software Integrity or in the semiconductor business that are looking for maybe some payment flexibility? I saw that provisions for doubtful accounts went up, but I'm just curious where the strength in cash flow is expected to come from? -- Yeah, for the most part, we haven't seen any meaningful impact of that or of customers coming back and renegotiating terms. And so far that's been very positive. We're prepared for that kind of potential, but so far, we haven't seen much of an impact. And the strength in the cash flow outlook is really confidence in the P&L and what we're guiding to. It's pretty solid growth for the year, as well as, good margin improvement and that's going to eventually translate to cash and it's a reflection of both strong collections and more effective disbursements or lower disbursements. -- Great. All right, thank you, sir. -- You're welcome. -- You're welcome.And next, we turn to the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, everybody. Let me extend my congratulations as well. The 7% sequential increase in backlog is commendable and -- but reading between the lines, I see that your average license duration has spiked quite significantly. And so does that speak to, I guess, the concentration of the record orders with perhaps one customer renewal or is there some more diverse overall bookings trends there? -- It is the second. It's not a single customer at all. It is multiple customers. I think in general, there are often variations in length of contracts. At this point in time, it is encouraging that the contracts have not become shorter as in times of economic stress, people could be worried about it. That's obviously not be the case at all. And I said, from a use and approach to design, we see no difference. If nothing else, there are a number of companies that are really accelerating as they hope to have good opportunities in next year with new products. So the technology advances are on track and the business I think reflects that directly. -- Okay. -- I would also add that the -- it's nice to have the -- that large backlog in an environment like this, in general, but particularly in an environment like this. But the Q2 bookings was not only a record in absolute numbers, but we also saw very good run rate growth in the quarter. So, I'm pleased with that combination. -- Okay. And as my follow-up question, with the shelter-in-place, I guess, largely still intact there in the Bay Area and perhaps affecting access to your facilities and access to labs and whatnot, is that a hindrance to completion of some IP deliverables? Is that perhaps an explanation why the fourth quarter may be so back-end loaded? -- Well, initially there were a number of questions of how to best get access to labs, how to manage that, can we manage it. I think there too we were able to find practical solutions pretty quickly and I'm actually, very positively surprised that how well the IP group is executing as we continue to send chips to manufacturing as we continue to deliver new cores. And so I think the distribution of revenue is more a function of the uptake from the customer than anything else. -- Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks, everyone. -- You're welcome. -- You're welcome.And next, we turn to the line of Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. First on the Software Integrity business. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the delay in business decisions that you alluded to on the prepared remarks? And then what gives you the confidence in the low-double-digit growth target that you imply the business would grow this year? And then secondly, how have your sales efforts been impacted by the shelter-in-place orders in SIG? Have your spending plans changed at all versus what they were last quarter? Thanks. -- Yeah, let me go backwards on that. As the working at home started to become acted on, it was many of our customers, it did slow the interaction somewhat. We also saw some slowdown in our ability to hire people as quickly as we had planned. And those are the type of things that then tend to impact the orders rates that one gets then. And so one can certainly always point I think that we could do better under the circumstances, but all in all, the reception to the type of capabilities that we have and the need have not diminished at all.As a matter of fact, you can see how a wave of concern has gone through many of our customers as they established work-from-home and immediately the security of many of those installations were somewhat in question. Now, we ourselves barely touched that. But that is not the field that we're in. But the secondary ramification of that is that people will look again harder at what to do in the software to protect from future security breaches. So from that perspective, I think the business opportunity is just as healthy as it was before. The circumstances will evolve and I think our execution can improve and that's what we're focusing on. -- Great. And then my follow up, just generally speaking, do you see any read across to the EDA industry more broadly from the duplication of SMEs and tech supply chain that you seem to be progressing toward? Just asking, following up on TSMC's decision to build a fab in Arizona. Thanks. -- I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the first. You said something across, but I'm not sure what the something was. -- Do you see any read across to the EDA industry broadly from the duplication of supply chain efforts with U.S. and China? Thanks. -- That is an interesting question, because whenever supply chain starts to duplicate efforts, they actually become less efficient, which is actually not a bad thing for the people supplying to them in turn. And so I don't think that we see an enormous amount of effort in that yet. But clearly there are sort of fairly big macro discussions on different countries wanting to have a high degree of independence of other countries, all the way to manufacturing of semiconductors as you saw per the recent announcements of TSMC. And so I think that we're going to see a fairly dynamic evolution over the next year. And given that we're connected to all of those people very well, I certainly intend for us to participate in whatever they're going to build and whatever they need to construct in a fashion that is good for our business. -- Great, thanks and congrats on the results. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.And next, we turn to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good evening. Aart, needless to say the comments about record orders was quite important and the same about record backlog. If I'm not mistaken, the last quarterly record for bookings was seven years ago. The question is... -- Wow! -- Yes, the question is how will this momentum in EDA influence, sort of, your direction or allocation of internal resources? Normally, when we see that kind of strength in EDA again driven by demand and new product adoption, we would see, for instance, significant ramping up of the AE capacity as a coincidental or leading indicator for that kind of strength in EDA. So perhaps you could talk about that kind of internal investment you're thinking of incrementally for EDA and conversely, what you might be doing differently in terms of SIG investments as you go through this slower period of growth. And maybe Trac can comment a little bit more elaborately on the restructuring intend.And then my second question is back on EDA. You, in the last year in a couple of conversations we've had, spoke about two big trends driving the EDA industry. One was moving from the general to the specific or specialty chips, as you call them, and that the next big thing in EDA was, as you described it, prototyping broadly speaking at different levels of abstraction. I'm sure you remember those comments. Is there any way to parse how either or both of those is directly having a business impact incrementally versus, let's say, older forms of design or older methods? -- Okay. I will try to answer that in less than half an hour. Let me start with the very good results from an order perspective. And frankly, I didn't know they were seven years ago. At that time we were more collared by single large customers making an impact. This was much broader. Nonetheless, when we entered the global pandemic crisis, it became instantaneously clear that there were more questions than answers on what this would do to the market, to the behavior of the customers and so on. And it was also instantaneously clear to Synopsys that it was all hands on deck to make sure that we maintain strong relationships with the customers, first, from a support point of view to make sure that they do well. And secondly, from the perspective of continuing to bring in the business in order for us to be able to fund however long the downturn maybe.We executed on that clearly well and as mentioned, I think one of the very early questions today, I think, partially it is because we focused extremely well, but also because we are at a good time with new products and new necessities from a design point of view, such as the new nodes, the advanced technologies, the increase of IP reuse, etc. And so we will continue to manage the way we have always done, which is, we committed to you to obviously optimize the growth rate, but also to work toward the ops margin improvement and this helps in the right direction.But this also ties to your next question, which is what are the key trends behind this from a technology point of view. And what I must have called many years ago specialty chips, now we would call AI and machine learning chips, because that is really the whole generation that have completely readdressed architectures. And it's important to understand just a little bit why that is relevant to us because no matter what, when you do computing engines such as for AI, you want speed, speed, speed, except these computing engines are extremely large machines of parallel small processors with very big data rates and often a big bandwidth.And so there every company that is invested in that is doing their own thing and trying to be differentiated. And so they are truly specialty chips and what is particularly interesting is a number of these are now splitting into multiple chips and that is why 3DIC Compiler is such an interesting product because after many, many years of worrying about Moore's Law may be slowing down a little bit, and it has slowed down somewhat, although it's much more alive than people think, this is a great answer if one can go to multiple chips that are extremely well connected. And so the specialty chips, as you call them, are the architectures that are precisely driving the notion of being more chips together.Now, in that context, the prototyping is just as relevant because the other half of a product is the software that runs in it and the more complex these specialty chips are, the more complex the software is, and the more there is risk that the software doesn't work when the chip comes out or that the chip doesn't -- wasn't quite responsive to the software it was intended to be on, that is where prototyping sits in the middle. It allows people to check and run their software before they actually have the hardware. And so I expect that we will see continued attention and growth to this and certainly, we are investing strongly in these areas.So bottom line is nobody will ever argue that strong orders is not a good thing. Obviously, we have to execute now in the next few quarters. We'll see what the global economy does. I think that semiconductors is actually in a good spot relatively speaking to most other markets and we have not seen a slowdown. -- Hey, Jay. In addition to that, to your question regarding the restructuring, we are committed and we remain on path to driving margins up over time. In addition to that, we'll continue to invest in the business, because all of the segments that we're in, we're seeing good growth opportunities. The restructuring is really a reflection of fine-tuning the investments and making sure that we're placing heavier bets in the areas where we think we can get the best combination of growth and profitability. -- Thank you very much. -- You're welcome. -- Thank you, Jay.And next, we turn to the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice to hear from everyone. First question, maybe, Trac, can you maybe go into the comments on the pull forward of some revenues from Q3? Is this more in the EDA side or the hardware side? -- Mostly on the EDA side. What we saw in EDA, particularly, in Q2 was just a few shorter contract [Technical Issues] their SSAs and so we saw that benefit and that's why you might see a little bit higher on the time base relative to the upfronts. But overall, the profile for the year, significant growth and strength across the board. -- Great. And then my follow up, the SIG margins did increase 300 basis points, probably the highest SIG margins that you reported since breaking that segment out. How much of this was from the restructuring, maybe the slower hiring, and then would you look to prioritize managing profitability for this segment while the growth profile is a more and more challenged? -- It's a little bit of the efficiency you described. You're right. The SIG margins [Phonetic] come up to around 30%. We mentioned at the beginning of the year that we were going to try to invest further in that business to invest for growth. I think we're still committed to that plan and the profile from margins will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the ramp-up in expenses. I wouldn't extrapolate that out to the full year or as a new plan. We'll continue to balance investing the business while making sure it fits into the overall company. -- Great, thank you. -- You're welcome.And next, we turn to the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. And Mr. Krish have you kept your phone on mute? -- Maybe we can go to the next and come back to the gentleman.Thank you. And next, we turn to line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Aart, quick question, just going back to China, appreciate all the color you gave on the recent Huawei licensing news from last week and the military use. But I'm just kind of curious just given how critical EDA is to the software -- to the semiconductor ecosystem and China's desire to kind of build that system out, you guys become a really important sort of pawn on the geopolitical sort of chess board, and so I'm kind of curious you break out Asia-Pacific revenue, but you don't break out China revenue specifically. Can you help us kind of just ballpark that?And I guess as you look inside of China, what percent of the customers are you supporting in China today that if for some reason, you couldn't, that demand would probably get soaked up somewhere else, i.e, Huawei can't ship into phones, but maybe MediaTek and Qualcomm can? And to what percent of the Chinese customers do you think are maybe a lot of start-ups that if you're not shipping to them, that demand probably doesn't go elsewhere? -- Well, this is a very difficult hypothetical question because there are so many geopolitical forces, de facto, in play at the same time. I can tell you that, so far, a number of companies have picked up very quickly where others could not develop themselves. And I expect that to continue because after all, globally speaking, it's a very open market and people jump in when there is an opportunity one way or another. And so really since the Entity List came about which was May last year, we obviously have learned how to live with that, and really have not felt much change. Growth continues well in China, actually growth continues well overall in the world, but China particularly and many, many companies that are jumping in both there as well as in other parts of the globe. -- That's helpful. And then maybe for a follow-up, just back to SIG. I'm just kind of making sure I understand this, is the growth, sort of, slowdown here, a function of your inability to actually bring on new headcount and drive channel growth there or is it actual customer activity? And I guess I'm asking the question -- I'm just trying to get a better sense of why the confidence that once we get through this COVID phenomenon, growth will reaccelerate there. What metrics are you looking at to support that view? -- Sure. Well, I think the most objective answer has to be that it's a combination of the two, meaning that, yes, we did see a slowdown as a number of customers just have been sidetracked into their own survival challenges in different ways and that tends to slow down this type of investment at the same time, and you saw a little bit of that in our commenting that our hiring was slower than planned. That is our own execution that is in question. So, bottom line is, we will need to put -- continue to put effort in bringing this part of Synopsys into a very good profile and we're doing exactly that.Now what gives confidence, what gives confidence is that the problem is not shrinking at all and the solution that we have is getting better and better. Now you say, well, that in itself doesn't give you money. But, yeah, you're right, we have to work for that. But the problem will continue to grow and it will continue to grow because so many electronic systems are much more intertwined than they were before. And that will continue to happen in the present pathway that electronics is on. Therefore, there will be needed more assurances that the sub pieces have built in security in a variety of ways.That certainly is massively the case on software, but as a side note, will also increasingly be the case on the hardware side. So there is nothing that has changed in our opinion of this being a good market, a technically challenged thing, therefore particularly good market for us and the combination of the overall situation and perhaps our own execution gave us -- led us to this point. But let's not underestimate. This is actually a very good business for Synopsys. It is now growing a bit slower than we wanted this year. But it is well on track to have a good future. -- Thanks. -- You're welcome.And speakers, we have no further questions in queue. -- Well, in that case, let me first thank you to attend. My assumption is that, if not all of you, most of you attend from home, so we hope that even that your home situations, family situations are also safe and sound, and all the more that we appreciate hearing your voice and having your support on a quarterly basis through these earnings releases. Please take care of yourself and be well. Bye-bye.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

For more details on this strategy, About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (""Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,"" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a ""stocks for the everyman/everywoman"", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.About Validea: Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (Symbol: DEF), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $53.31 per unit.


With DEF trading at a recent price near $47.81 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.50% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of DEF's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Ingersoll Rand Inc (Symbol: IR), Mondelez International Inc (Symbol: MDLZ), and Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS). Although IR has traded at a recent price of $28.13/share, the average analyst target is 19.29% higher at $33.55/share. Similarly, MDLZ has 16.37% upside from the recent share price of $50.70 if the average analyst target price of $59.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SNPS to reach a target price of $172.22/share, which is 15.09% above the recent price of $149.64. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of IR, MDLZ, and SNPS:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"Everyone is talking about artificial intelligence (AI) right now- with many predicting that AI will lead the next wave of economic growth and productivity for the next couple of decades at least.AI refers to the use of data to simulate human intelligence processes including learning, reasoning and self-correction by machines. AI is making its way into almost every industry. Data collection and collation, automation systems from factories to self-driving cars, even online shopping site – they all benefit from AI applications. With IDC predicting that worldwide spending on AI will be nearly $98 Billion in 2023, the implications of this technology are massive.And this has not been ignored by Wall Street. Analysts say that plenty of compelling investments can be found within this space. With this in mind, We’ve opened up , and pulled three AI stocks that are on the leading edge of the technology. Importantly, all 3 have amassed enough bullish calls from analysts to be given “Strong Buy” consensus ratings. So much of the digital world depends on image, making branding a valuable commodity. Yext works in the niche, offering on-line brand management for clients like Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, T-Mobile, Taco Bell, and Roots clothing. Yext is a heavy user of AI tech, employing it alongside data from heavy hitters such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, to add context to searches for better results in real time. By using AI to combine brand management with SEO, Yext makes it possible for customers to better control what their customers see online.Yext grossed $228.3 million in revenue for fiscal 2019, up 34% from the previous year. The most recent quarterly report, for Q4, showed quarterly revenues above the forecast at $81.4 million. EPS showed a net loss, as expected, but at 27 cents the loss was a 28% sequential improvement from Q3. The company’s balance sheet is strong, with zero debt, $256 million cash on hand, and a credit facility up to $50 million., 5-star analyst from RBC Capital, is impressed by Yext, and believes the shares have a clear path for forward growth in the mid- to long-term. He says of the company, “Although Yext’s growth has slowed as of late, we think the company is capable of sustaining +20% growth over the next several years given that Yext Answers may potentially be a strong new product for the company... It is still an open question whether/when Yext’s investments in International expansion and salesforce ramp will translate to growth, but we remain optimistic and expect that these investments will start to pay dividends in FY21.”Mahaney’s bullish stance is backed by an $18 price target that implies a robust upside of 43% for the next 12 months. (To watch Mahaney’s track record, )Overall, Yext stock has been endorsed with ""buy"" ratings by all four of the analysts who have voiced an opinion on the shares over the past three months. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate of analysts polled is that Yext shares should rise a 61% to hit $20.25 within a year. () This software company went public less than a year, just last August, and its main product is an AI software used to both monitor and manage cloud infrastructure. In-house cloud infrastructure support allows companies to minimize the strain on their networks, by finding potential problems before they cause severe disruptions of the systems. Dynatrace’s AI product gave a strong boost to company share values in the fourth and first quarters, when DT shares doubled in just four months.Dynatrace posted a quarterly profit, in its last report, of 6 cents per share. This was double the 3 cents expected, and up dramatically from the 53-cent loss posted in the previous quarter. Looking forward, DT is expected to show another profit, of 3 cents per share, in for the first quarter of 2020, despite the coronavirus hit.In fact, the current share price may present an opportunity. , 5-star analyst with BMO Capital, says it explicitly, writing of DT, “While we lower our estimates as a result of ongoing COVID-19 impacts, we… believe current trading levels present an attractive buying opportunity for investors… We anticipate durable revenue growth and FCF margin improvement during our forecast period. Further, we think DT can comfortably realize FCF of 30%...”Bachman’s Buy rating comes with a price target that has been reduced from $40 to $35 – but even that lower level suggests a 24% growth potential for the stock. (To watch Bachman’s track record, )With 9 ratings from Wall Street, including 7 Buys against just 2 Holds, DT shares have a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus. The share price, at $27.16, is affordable, while the average price target is far more conservative than Bachman’s. At $28, it implies a modest downside of 1%. If Dynatrace continues to outperform, expect the analysts to adjust their targets upwards. () Last but not least is Synopsys, a company that provides software and intellectual property solutions for the design and testing of chips (integrated circuits) and computer systems. The company’s technology is present in artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and Internet of Things (IoT) consumer products.The strength of the company’s niche is clear from its recent stock performance. Where the S&P 500 is still down 16% from its late-February peak, SNPS shares have outperformed – the stock has rebounded more than the general market. The company’s most recent quarterly report, for fiscal Q1, beat the forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue came in at $834.4 million, and EPS at $1.01. In addition, revenues were also up year-over-year, by 1.7%. It was a strong Q1 performance, especially after the company finished fiscal 2019 with $3.3 billion in total revenue.High stock performance is an attraction for investors, but SNPS also offers predictability, which is sometimes lacking in the fast-changing tech world. Synopsis’ business model is based on three-year customer subscriptions, which cannot be canceled. It gives the company a short-term consistency in earnings, that makes it easier for investors to predict profits.Wells Fargo 5-star analyst  points out another piece of ‘predictability’ in his recent note on SNPS. He writes, “SNPS typically starts a quarter with 90% of expected revenue coming from backlog... We believe, worst case, SNPS could see some short-term erosion in backlog because of customers’ concerns over COVID-19. However, we also believe this may be short-lived as chip design activity must march on as the semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and chip companies must remain focused on staying ahead of the pack.”Mobley likes this stock, and rates it a Buy, with a $180 price target that suggests room for a 19% upside. (To watch Mobley’s track record, )Synopsis’ Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous: 11 analysts have weighed in and rated this stock a Buy. Shares are trading at $149.64, and the the $179.27 average price target is in line with Mobley’s, and predicts a 19% upside potential for the coming year.

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Thursday, shares of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.6, after changing hands as low as $136.12 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 21.3.  A bullish investor could look at SNPS's 29.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Intel Capital, the venture arm of chipmaker Intel Corp , has invested in two Chinese startups in the semiconductor sector, the company announced on Wednesday, as part of its latest batch of deals.The investments in companies that compete in fields typically dominated by U.S. players come as Intel remains embroiled in tensions between the United States and China over chip manufacturing.ProPlus, one the Chinese startups Intel Capital has funded, makes EDA software that chip makers use to design their products before manufacturing them.The leaders in that field, Cadence Design Systems Inc , Mentor Graphics, and Synopsys Inc  - all hail from the United States.ProPlus Chairman and CEO Zhihong Liu once worked as a VP at Cadence Technologies while its director, Chenming Hu, once served as the CTO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd  (TSMC).Spectrum Materials, based in the southern Chinese province of Fujian, makes gases critical for semiconductor fabs to produce physical chips. The sector is typically dominated by players in the United States, South Korea, and Japan.China's government has committed billions of dollars to help fund the domestic semiconductor industry, which it views as critical to catching up with the United States and other governments.The stakes for such initiatives have increased after the United States imposed restrictions on American companies supplying to Huawei, China's top telecommunications eqiupment provider and a leading chip maker in its own right.Intel Capital has consistently invested in Chinese startups along with small chip companies from around the world. In 2019 and 2018 it announced investments in two Chinese chip startups.This batch of announced investments comes days after Intel CEO Bob Swan wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Defense expressing readiness to build a chip fab in the United States, with the goal of ensuring U.S. technological leadership.(Reporting by Josh Horwitz; Editing by Stephen Coates)((; +86 21 20830007;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intel Capital invests in Chinese chip companies amid tech tensions@2020-05-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-capital-invests-in-chinese-chip-companies-amid-tech-tensions-2020-05-13
"Investors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options become available this week, for the May 15th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new May 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of 70 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $84.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $121.41/share today.

Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 30% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.82% return on the cash commitment, or 6.13% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.80.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $121.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $125.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.73% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $125.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.78% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.59% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 110%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 61%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $121.41) to be 38%.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Invesco S&P 500— High Beta ETF (Symbol: SPHB), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $52.67 per unit.


With SPHB trading at a recent price near $46.74 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.68% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of SPHB's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (Symbol: HPE), Cadence Design Systems Inc (Symbol: CDNS), and Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS). Although HPE has traded at a recent price of $14.18/share, the average analyst target is 21.51% higher at $17.23/share. Similarly, CDNS has 17.26% upside from the recent share price of $74.73 if the average analyst target price of $87.62/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SNPS to reach a target price of $173.22/share, which is 16.00% above the recent price of $149.33. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of HPE, CDNS, and SNPS:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q1 2020 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys  for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. [Operator Instructions]At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. Q1 was an excellent start to the year as we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets. Revenue was $834 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 and non-GAAP earnings above our target range at $1.01. In December, we communicated our fiscal 2020 guidance: high single-digit revenue growth, substantial ops margin expansion, mid-teens non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth and more than $800 million in operating cash flow. We are reaffirming our guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the financials in more details. Looking at the overall landscape, ongoing geopolitical tension and the recent coronavirus outbreak have generated heightened uncertainty around the world. Regarding the virus outbreak, our first priority has been the safety and health of our employees, customers and partners. We continue to monitor the situation and support our China teams as they continue to drive business execution. Undeterred by those challenges, electronics companies, ranging from traditional semiconductor and systems companies to new start-ups and hyperscalers, persist in designing ever more complex chips and devices with a high degree of market urgency. Driven by AI and machine learning, automotive, 5G, IoT and cloud expansion, the proliferation of smart everything is and will be the central driver for years to come.As a result, robust demand for our solutions has continued in 2020. Our innovation and technologies, spanning the spectrum from silicon to software, absolutely central to the ambitious products and systems being built. Let me share some product highlights from the quarter, starting with EDA. An important differentiator for Synopsys continues to be our leading position in enabling manufacturing process development. With highly sophisticated simulation of new technologies, new transistors and the structures needed for the most advanced fabs in the world, we not only assist our manufacturing partners but we also lay the groundwork for our design tools to be tuned and ready well before these technologies go into production design. On top of that, over the last several years, Synopsys has pioneered a new approach called Fusion that literally fuses algorithms from different tools, resulting in faster and lower power chips in far less time. A showcase example of this is our Fusion Compiler product introduced about a year ago. Within just a few months of its introduction, Fusion Compiler revealed itself as a revolutionary product. It is winning head-to-head benchmarks with consistently superior performance, power and area results across a broad set of applications. Results thus far are ahead of our initial plan, with many customer engagements progressing very well from exploring the tool to usage on a few life design blocks to production rollout.In Q1, we built upon several breakthrough competitive wins ranging from the largest global communications process and graphics firms to high-impact cloud hyperscalers to multiple influential system houses. For example, AMD chose Fusion Compiler for its full flow digital design implementation of its next-generation processes. Fusion Compiler is displacing the competition at a large hyperscaler for our next-generation ARM core-based graphics design at 5-nanometer and below. We achieved a significant win at a large multinational consumer electronics company on next-gen ARM CPU core. We're expanding displacement and deployment at a leading mobile company for critical 5G designs at 5- and 4-nanometer. A leading U.S. semiconductor company is deploying Fusion Compiler on all new graphics designs, taking advantage of better run time and quality of results. We displaced the competition for ARM core designs at a leading automotive semiconductor company, and we expanded proliferation at a large U.S. semiconductor leader with a new win in wireless design. While still relatively early in our multiyear product cycle, these important wins represent significant momentum and usage share gains, which will flow into revenue over time.The Fusion concept is very powerful and is getting great results across Synopsys as our innovation continues at a rapid pace. Stay tuned for some exciting new product announcements as we approach our March Silicon Valley user group event. Let me now turn to custom design, a product area that underwent a multiyear innovation push and has seen excellent progress over the last 18 months. Not only are we now highly competitive for advanced nodes, we continue to see a growing number of displacements and full flow engagements. Our expansion is driven by fresh innovations focused on maximizing designer productivity. Customers are experiencing this benefit, and we saw excellent growth in revenue from our Custom Compiler product again this quarter. For example, a high-impact global systems company expanded its full flow usage of in Q1, proliferating after a significant competitive displacement. Additional Custom Compiler wins include a leading silicon photonics developer and a CMOS image sensor company. Let me now move to our Verification Continuing Platform, where we maintain our number one market share position. In verification software, we gained share in Q1 at a large global hyperscaler, driven by their growing needs for verification capacity across our platform. Meanwhile, demand for hardware-based verification is high across the board, driven by continued complexity growth in new designs.The speed and capacity of our solutions are particularly well suited whenever software bring-up is involved. While a strong Q1 last year makes for a tough year-over-year hardware comparison, we continue to gain momentum with both new and existing customers. In Q1, we gained nine new logos and 34 repeat orders, including very high-profile systems and semiconductor companies. NEC, for example, chose our ZeBu emulation system over the incumbent for their high-performance compute solutions due to our superior performance, very fast bring-up time and unique debug visibility. In Q1, we also announced the acquisition of the DINI Group, which further expands our HAPS FPGA-based prototyping portfolio. Now to IP, which continues to deliver strong results. As the number one provider of interface, embedded memory, analog and foundry-specific IP, we provide the industry's broadest portfolio covering all key markets: AI, automotive, cloud, IoT and 5G mobile. Our demonstrated strength in high-performance cloud computing applications is evident in several areas. We've already achieved more than 60 design wins in PCI Express 5.0. Our new die-to-die 56- and 112-gig SerDes continues to gain market traction. We also had a significant IP portfolio win with a major China e-commerce company for micro server applications. Our leadership position in USB led to multiple Tier one processor semiconductor companies adopting our newest generation USB 4.0 IP in a leading 5-nanometer process.We're also seeing unmatched leadership and momentum in automotive where our automotive-grade IP is being used by 10 of the top 11 semiconductor suppliers to that industry. One notable example is Qualcomm, which selected our automotive IP portfolio including interface, ARM processors and embedded test and repair solutions for the new Snapdragon Ride platform for autonomous driving. Finally, we continue to expand our IP portfolio with the acquisition of technologies from eSilicon and INVECAS, the latter closing just last week. Along with valuable technology, these acquisitions also enable us to further scale our IP development to meet high customer demand across growing markets. Now to software integrity, the tools that test software code for security, vulnerabilities and quality issues. We delivered a solid beginning to the year with business levels up more than 30% over the same period last year. We see we saw continued progress in driving multiyear, multimillion-dollar agreements, booking several across multiple verticals. As I mentioned in December, we have entered Phase two of our strategy, scaling into the $500 million to $1 billion revenue space. To accomplish this, we're focused on four areas: one, expanding our cloud-based Polaris Software Integrity Platform through additional product integrations; two, scaling consulting engagements to fully leverage a key differentiator in the software DevOps market; three, refining our channel to better serve large enterprise customers, key market verticals and new regional business; and four, evolving our management team for the complexity and size of a larger business. We're moving fast on all of these. Just last week, we announced the expansion of the Polaris platform, bringing static testing and software composition analysis directly to the developer's desktop.This first-of-its-kind solution enables developers to seamlessly find and fix security weaknesses in proprietary code and known vulnerabilities in open source code, all within their desktop development environment. We also added the team and products from Tinfoil Security, broadening our product offerings for Dynamic Application Security Testing or DAST and adding API scanning capability. Our scaling efforts in the field are also progressing well as we've ramped up hiring activity and are excited about the sales energy in the organization. A good example of the power of the combination of products and consulting is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. A relationship that began with a small initial service engagement to help them respond to a security breach has grown to include both product purchases and now additional services to help them proliferate our solutions. We're also moving fast to scale our leadership and management team to the next level.We have launched an external search for a new general manager to lead the organization into the $500 million to $1 billion level. While these efforts will flow into revenue over time, we're encouraged by the positive start. There's a tremendous opportunity in this space, and we're well positioned to enable companies to improve the security and quality of their software with a combination of high-value products, a great new platform and enabling consulting services. In closing, Q1 was a very good start to the year. We delivered strong financial results and are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2020. Even with some caution around global markets, electronics companies continue to invest in critical chip and system designs as well as immense amounts of sophisticated software. Our innovation engine is prolific. And this quarter, we will be introducing a number of exciting new products and differentiating capabilities. We are committed and on track toward our mid- and long-term growth and margin expansion targets. Finally, let me thank our customers for their business and our employees for their dedication and hard work in delivering continued strong results.Trac will now highlight the financial perspective. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong start to the year, meeting or exceeding our guidance targets for the quarter and we are on pace for our full year plan. We remain relentlessly focused on execution, generating revenue for the quarter at the high end of our target range and non-GAAP earnings per share well above the range. We produced another quarter of strong collections, which contribute to positive cash flow in a quarter that's typically an outflow due to variable compensation payouts, and we launched a $100 million share repurchase. Our increasingly diverse customer base and strong product portfolio combined with our nearly 90% recurring revenue model, position us for success in periods of high demand as well as those of greater uncertainty. Multiple factors, including the entity list export restrictions and broader trade tensions as well as the coronavirus situation have added to market volatility. Based on our current view and the strength of our business, we are confident in our ability to manage through this uncertainty, and we are reiterating our guidance for the year. I'll now review our first quarter results.All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of $834 million. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $749 million, with strong growth in IP and a tough hardware comparison over a strong Q1 of last year. Excluding hardware and the impact of entity list trade restrictions, EDA software results remained within our long-term target range of mid- to high single digits. Software Integrity segment revenue was $86 million, 10% of total, and business levels for the quarter increased more than 30%. Because of our largely time-based model, the associated revenue will be recognized over the life of the contracts. Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $747 million, which includes approximately $9 million in restructuring costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $647 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 22.4%. Our Q1 margin reflects revenue profile this year as well as a change in the timing of general salary increases now in Q1. We are on track to generate approximately 200 basis points of op margin expansion for the year.Adjusted operating margin for Semiconductor & System Design was 23.9% and Software Integrity was 9.4%. Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $0.67 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01. Turning to cash. We generated a $10 million in operating cash flow. Including the $100 million Q1 ASR, we've repurchased $1.9 billion of our stock since 2015 or approximately 80% of our free cash flow returned to shareholders over that period. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $700 million and total debt of $331 million. A couple of comments before I move on to our targets. As I've noted, we delivered a strong start to the year and we are reiterating our full year guidance. We are maintaining our first half-second half revenue split of roughly 45%-55%, which reflects forecasted timing of IP and hardware deliveries as well as general prudence, given the uncertainty around the unfolding coronavirus situation.For fiscal 2020, we are targeting revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.95 billion and $3 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.63 billion and $2.66 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%; GAAP earnings of $3.68 to $3.87 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $5.18 to $5.25 per share; cash flow from operations of $800 million to $825 million and capital expenditures of approximately $180 million. We expect capital expenditures to decline in 2021. Now to the targets for the second quarter: revenue between $820 million and $850 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $724 million and $758 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $645 million and $665 million; GAAP earnings of $0.49 to $0.62 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.96 to $1.01 per share. In conclusion, our focused execution enabled us to again deliver strong results, meeting or exceeding our targets. With a very good start in Q1, we are reaffirming the full year guidance provided in December. We are also tracking well to our goals of high 20s operating margin by 2021 and profitability at 30% range longer term as we move toward our next milestone of $4 billion in revenue. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, consisting of investing in the business for growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders as we focus on driving sustainable long-term shareholder value.And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you.Our question on Software Integrity. So you mentioned you had very good business levels. I think you said 30% increase in business levels, but it looked like revenue decelerated pretty sharply in the business. I just wanted to understand if business levels refer to bookings, and why the deceleration in revenue and what might drive that to reaccelerate. -- So you're correct. Business levels refer to bookings. And you may recall that last quarter reported that 2019 had been relatively weak in terms of bookings. And so what you saw is the result of that plus whatever was transacted during the quarter. And so our objective obviously is to now build back to a high level and we will actively pursue that. -- Any thoughts or commentary on when that business might reaccelerate sort of into the double digits or teens? -- Well, I mean, we just finished what we thought was a strong quarter, so it's easier said than done to just keep doing that, but that's obviously the objective, right, is to invest in some of the channel areas specifically that I think can be more balanced for the opportunity space and make sure that we move fast on the deployment of the Polaris platform and the integration of new capabilities. Those are sort of some of the cornerstones to the success of the long-term business. -- Rich, just keep in mind that in December, we also highlighted that the in December, we highlighted the long-term growth for this business over a multiyear period is 15% to 20%. And we are committed to that and we should be able to grow at least with the market or faster. -- Got it. Just a quick follow-up to that. Aart, you've talked about the sales force realignment and it sounds like some new personnel being brought in. Where do you think that both that sales force is in terms of structure and personnel relative to where you want it to be? Is there more you need to bring in? You think you feel like you've got pretty much the sort of the headcount you need to drive the business forward? -- Well, we're now in active hiring. We have hired a number of people. It's both a combination of tuning, meaning putting it in the right organization and simultaneously filling the holes as we see opportunities, and there are plenty of opportunities. So no, we are far from done but we have a good start. And actually, some of the changes that we made in 2019 appear to have generated quite a bit of energy on the part of the sales force that feels that they have a better shot this year than last year. -- I'd also reiterate that as part of our plan, we did contemplate the hiring, the additional hirings in that business. We'll continue to invest in that business as it scales. And as we said in December, which we're still on track for us maintaining margins relatively flat year-over-year. So all the commentary that we described is consistent with how we're managing the business. -- Got it. Yes, the bookings sound encouraging. Look forward to seeing the progress there. -- Thank you.And our next question from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open. -- That's one of the easier questions. It sounds like we have no connection, operator.Let me check, if Joe Vruwink, you line is open. Okay. He may pop back into the queue here momentarily. We'll go to our next person Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.The first one I kind of wanted to point to is for Trac. So given the coronavirus, some of the other macro concerns, my question is since you guys beat pretty nicely in the first quarter, would you have raised the full year, assuming that there was no macro change? Or do you believe that this is already encapsulated in your full year guide? -- It's affecting our guidance. I would say that it's not a meaningful impact to the year. We did get a very strong start to the year. So after 90 days, we feel very good about the outlook for the business on a full year basis. As we typically do describe, after one quarter, it's a good start and it gives us good progress through the year but there's still a lot of business left to book. -- If I may add to that, our business is actually mostly multiyear. And so we have actually a fairly high degree of stability in our business toward events like this. At the same time, it is clear that some of the customers or the customers' customers are impacted because they may not be able to ship products. And so it remains to be seen if that makes its way all the way to us. But mostly, we're quite isolated or insulated, I should say, from these type of problems. -- Okay. Got you. And then for my second one, just on the core EDA business, you guys have talked about mid- to high single-digit growth. But if I look at this, it looks like for the last about six quarters now, it's been below about 4%. So I guess, why is the time-based revenue flat year-over-year if EDA software is still growing mid- to high singles? Is that just going to accelerate in the back half? And if so, I'm just trying to understand why that would be the case. -- Yes, Mitch, I would separate the that question to two parts. The first part is, keep in mind that emulation does show up in the EDA line. So from a product perspective, we've continued to grow very nicely in hardware, and that tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter but is continued growth on a multiyear basis, that will affect the comparison. The second part, which you're trying to connect to is this license type of time-based. Remember that last year, we did transition to 606. And the mix that you're going to see in the time-based versus the upfront line is affected by that revenue transition. As we described, the numbers and the comparisons for EDA is colored by the timing of hardware this year as well as the entity list that was affecting both the EDA and IP line. But we still feel very comfortable about our long-term and our model to drive in the mid- to high single digits. -- Got it. Thank you.Go back to Joe Vruwink's line. He is with Baird. Please go ahead. -- Can you hear me now? -- We can. -- I wanted to revisit the last question just regarding EDA performance. And I think obviously appreciating the market uncertainty, but your customers seem to have a more optimistic view on their R&D activity in 2020 and, I would argue, 2021. If that acceleration does come through, is there any reason why your EDA business wouldn't participate in that trend? -- No. There's no reason it would not participate because we as I think somewhat mentioned in the preamble, we see customers be quite aggressive in what they're designing. And so fundamentally, we are in a good market, and therefore, participation, be it in EDA or IP in that, is absolutely part of where we should do well. I think we're cautious just because there's been so many changes in the global market that have had some impact. As we gave out the numbers, we encompass the fact that we thought there would be no change to the entity list. And so those are the type of things that we're dealing with for the year. But fundamentally, actually, I think that we are in a long-term good market, leaving alone massive GDP fluctuation or anything like that. The technology needs are high for us and that's very encouraging. -- And then if I can follow up on Software Integrity and maybe trying to reconcile the comments a quarter ago that orders were a bit softer to what seems really like a snapback to this 30% type number. Is that just the actions you outlined a quarter ago and you started out the call talking about? Are those beginning to bear fruit already or are there some other things going on? -- Well, partially, the answer is definitely bear fruit because we have invested and made quite a number of changes certainly in the latter part of 2019. At the same time, I don't want to set the expectation that over 30% is the norm for every quarter. That's not what we're guiding toward. But the fact is, this was a very good quarter from an orders point of view, and so that will manifest itself in revenue over time. So I think we have a lot of opportunities to evolve the business, to be capable of rising above the $0.5 billion mark. And then you're sort of in a different league of management. And so many of the investments that we're making are really all aimed at the scale of scaling to that next level. -- Great. Thank you, very much. -- You are welcome.And our next question from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- The first one is on hardware. So coming out of last year, you mentioned that some large hardware deals slipped, and I'm not sure if we heard an update on what the expectations are for the timing and delivery of those now in 2020. -- Well, we typically don't give a specific timing of shipments because some people try to understand which customer did walk to whom. But the bottom line is one of the reasons that we think we have a strong year overall is that hardware will be strong and actually, the demand continues in that direction. It is also true that the delivery is lumpy, and that in itself is visible somewhat in the first half, second half of the year. -- Okay. I think I can follow the breadcrumbs there. And then just a follow-up on the Fusion wins, the competitive wins, specifically where you were where you mentioned you were displacing a competitor. Can you just give us a sense, either a mix or just identify some of the wins, whether these were brand-new customers to Synopsys or whether they were rewinning or winning back a customer that had maybe shifted away in the past? -- The answer is yes, yes and yes, meaning that they fall in all categories. In the past, it has been relatively rare that there would be brand-new customers because the semiconductor industry was relatively stable and actually partially consolidating. That has changed substantially in two ways: one is a number of the hyperscalers are becoming interestingly strongly interested in doing chip design; and secondly, there's a plethora of IP companies that are doing extremely advanced design on an extremely aggressive time scale. And for those, the utilization of our tools is just imperative to be able to succeed. So we have opportunities in all fronts. And the bottom line is we have to continue to push hard on the technology. But right now, it's very, very strong. -- Okay. All right. Thank you. -- You're welcome.We'll go to Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to ask about the China market, and can you just discuss trends there, excluding Huawei and how you see that market moving forward? And then if you see any potential impact from the proposed changes to the regulatory outlook, whether that's changed to the de minimis rule or the foreign direct product rule. -- Sure. Well, if you take away the entity list, then I would say no change, meaning that China continues to be very active, moving forward at a rapid pace, adopting new technologies and our business is strong. Regarding the entity list, we had assumed and somewhat predicted that there would be no radical change in the near future. So far, that has turned out to be true. But as we all know, things can happen in unexpected ways depending on how the tensions between the countries evolve. We do not expect that any part of the specific rules would have major impact on changes in our business because bottom line is to the entity list, we are not shipping. So that is sort of an all-or-nothing type situation already today. -- Great. And Trac, just wanted to follow up on the second half revenue outlook. Can you maybe give a little more detail about what your expectations are for a split between Q3 and Q4? And then I think on the prior call, for the SIG business, you had outlined that you expect to ramp up spending this year such that margins would stay relatively flat throughout the year. Is that still the goal? -- Yes. That's still the goal. So the let me start with the first question, this first half, second half. We do expect Q4 to be our directionally the largest quarter for revenues and EPS. That's consistent with the guidance. With regards to SIG, we do expect the hiring ramp to continue throughout the year, and that's reflected in the 200 basis point improvement. But quarter-to-quarter, you can get a little noisy but generally flattish with last year. -- Great. Thank you.And we'll go next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Aart, my first question, the word North American CPU guy where you found historically a pretty good position seems to be going to kind of a fundamental change, and they've been buying philosophy over the next couple of years, where we're going to move away from doing everything, their own IP to maybe using some more off-the-shelf block IPs within their design. I'm kind of curious, what are the puts and the takes or the opportunities that, that might create for you or the EDA space? -- John, my apologies but we sort of understood every second word. And so we sort of made out the words IP and the word trend, I think. I apologize. Is it possible to try to summarize just sort of the three or four words that are most interested to you, and I'll try to fabricate a response to that? -- Does this sound better? -- Yes. There's sort of this wobbling sound as if you were underwater. -- Yes, I apologize. I'm on a cellphone. Is this any better or not? -- Marginally so. Did I get the word IP correctly? -- Yes. The question is that the large North American CPU guy is moving to kind of a different design philosophy methodology, where they're going to be using less of their own kind of internal IP design or off-the-shelf blocks. I'm kind of curious as to what that means for you or the EDA space? -- I think I understand the question. I'll try to reask it a little bit, which is essentially of the North American CPU guys, are they changing their design methodology to use more reusable IP? Well, I want to broaden the question slightly because answering for there are not that many North American CPU guys, and it's not appropriate for me to answer in a fashion that recognizes the customers. But what I can say in general is there's no question that around CPU design, and I'll include in that GPU and all the views that are specialized for AI, the design methodology is definitely evolving. There's certainly some people that continue the old way to massively optimize for the last gigahertz, but for a majority, there's definitely a drift toward applications that use much more data so that tend to be more a machine learning-oriented. And with that comes architectures that are very much focused on getting data in and off chip. And so that in itself brings about a natural increase of potentially reasonable IP. And yes, I think the quality of the IP, the advanced nature, meaning the advanced nodes that our IP is available today and the close collaboration we have with all of these customers has made it possible that they're now counting for design methodologies that use substantially more IP than they did in the past. We expect that to continue, and we also expect to continue that the IP will become more complex because with the smaller nodes, it really takes a lot of effort to make them work very well. But it is now absolutely a distinguishing capability of the company. So essentially, what I'm trying to express to you is the IP business is difficult, but it is a great business for us to be in because it will continue to grow. It will continue to be demanding and therefore, a good area for us to be in. And we have long-term relationships with these customers where they acquire more and more pieces from us. -- That's helpful. As my follow-up, Trac, you said there was no impact from the coronavirus on the full fiscal year and that's understandable. Is there any cushion that you're embedding in the current quarter guidance? And to the extent that Software Integrity is not a part of the op margin expansion during this year, how do we think about that business going into 2021? And kind of at what leverage levels would you expect there to be a significant inflection in op margin for that business? -- So the question is the first question is related to Q2. Our my comment on the coronavirus to the numbers is consistent with Q2 and the full year, it's not meaningful. This is our best outlook for the year and I think it's pretty consistent with how we've been planning the year. With regards to SIG margins, we should be improving margins in FY 2021, and that's going to be a combination of us growing that business and continuing to scale that up and be more productive with the investments. -- Thank you.And our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Aart, for you first. In your answer just now to a question regarding the evolution of design methodologies, you put it largely in the context of the role or adoption of IT. Could you also speak to that in terms of core EDA and in terms of how customers are differentiating themselves vis-a-vis design process and the employment of the tools? I'm sure this has been the case since the primordial days of EDA three decades ago. And but when you look at the multiple applications and needs that you talk about, in what way do you think core EDA design flows, processes, methodologies are evolving or need to evolve for customers to continue to distinguish themselves aside from your incorporation of standard IP? For you, Trac, with regard to IT. In fiscal 2019, according to the 10-K, there was a $235 million positive impact from upfront IT revenue although total IT revenues increased by just over $100 million. How are you thinking about those wonderful 606 mechanics in 2020 with regard to the tough comp you would have on IT upfront revenue versus perhaps a somewhat easier comp on IT subs revenue? -- Okay. Let me start. Of course, your question can lead to 0.5 hour dissertation, which I will not do. But the first thing to start with is that there's still a continuation of adoption of extremely advanced nodes, and with that comes a nonstop demand for all of our tools, all the ones reaching deep into the physics and certainly all the physical design tools to be up to speed with these nodes. And by the way, their development is less clearly defined in time, meaning that a new node comes out, and then within three months, there's another version of that node and another three months, another version. And so there's constant adaptation as people are really squeezing out the max. Now in parallel to that, maybe less relevant but still worthwhile to note is that some of the older nodes are also being put more to use as people figure out that was the new tools, they can squeeze out more value out of those nodes and not all the products need the most advanced capabilities. Having said that, on the advanced capabilities, if there are two or three trends I could highlight for the tools, one is this notion that the capacity of the tools needs to continue to increase, because on Moore's Law, the one factor that really has not slowed down is the notion of increased density. Still more transistors per chip and that adds a lot of value for what you can do. In order to do that, we need to make sure that our tools interact well with each other.And so the notion of Fusion is really profound because it attempts to have every tool understand somewhat what the other tools will do and essentially have better team play, so to speak. What comes on top of that is that now the application of AI is absolutely deeply anchored already in our business. And we have capabilities in every one of our tools that are impacted by improvements through AI and increasingly, we'll see capabilities between the tools. The last comment I'll make is in the verification space, where a trend that we had diagnosed early on continues at high speed, which is with the strengthening of the chips and the combinations of chips, and I'm looking here at things that are assembled in a 3D fashion of multiple chips talking to each other such as processors and memories and maybe sensors, the importance of being able to verify both the hardware and the software at the same time continues to grow because whichever is the slowest or the worst of in quality will determine when something goes to market. And so that is the area where advanced stimulation techniques, emulation, prototyping play in. So those are sort of the forces that govern what we do. And I can bet that by next week, there will be yet another demand for something to keep going because there is no deceleration in sight. -- So Jay, on your question regarding IP, let me start by saying that we're very positive about our IP business. This is a as we described, a low double-digit growth business. And everything we're seeing in the marketplace and our bookings continue to reflect that outlook. That said, the 606 transition does introduce more variability to the numbers on a quarterly basis. But on a full year basis and on a multiyear basis, this is a very good growth business for us as reflected in the guidance for the full year. -- Also Trac, could you update us on your backlog number? -- Well, I know you're going to read our Q that's coming out shortly, and you'll see that the backlog is it's pretty steady at $4.4 billion and directionally up versus last quarter. And then within that, the run rate that we the business that we book was actually very positive. -- Okay. Great. Thank you. -- You're welcome.And our next question from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. The acquisition of Tinfoil fills a nice hole in the dynamic testing side for your SIG portfolio. Can you talk about how that acquisition came about? And maybe any other small holes your current offering has? -- It is a very nice acquisition. And in these new markets, everybody knows everybody. And so then the question is always, are there some acquisitions that are both timely, that are economically reasonable and where we can integrate rapidly in a broader solution? And of course, we have had experience in this EDA business for many really decades. And so there's some similarity in that. And what was particularly intriguing is that Tinfoil fits so nicely in the Polaris platform. Of course, we have to do the integration. But this is exactly the type of capabilities that we'd love to have there because it makes the platform more useful, more versatile for our customers as they adopt it, and it was designed to make these type of integrations possible and not too costly. So if I add to that, the fact that Tinfoil is truly remarkable, high-quality company with some stunning individuals in terms of their ability to look at the future. We and by the way, the locals that makes it easier to integrate. So far, it looks really promising. -- Okay. And then similar topic, the acquisition of the IP assets over the last few months. How should we think about those as far as complementary to the growth opportunity in IP or kind of the margin expansion opportunity in IP? -- Very good question. So our IP business is really two components: one is to continually drive both the breadth but I would say just as much the depth of what we do in IP. And depths would be the new technologies new versions of the technology, etc. But the other part is that actually, IP does require quite a bit of work. They are very often statement of works on delivering IP that fits exactly the needs of a customer, so maybe some small variations or some tuning for a specific technology. And so continuing to grow a workforce that can do this is just part of continuing to scale it overall. And so in both the cases of INVECAS and eSilicon was a combination of some technologies, and but most importantly, also a workforce that was very well suited for the type of needs that we have. So we see it as essentially just another way of continuing to broaden and grow our business. -- Great. Thanks for your time. -- You're welcome.[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had two of them. First one for Aart. Aart, if you look at it, like high-performance computing over the last several years has swung from being centralized cloud and now it's more distributed toward the edge. Kind of curious, how does this change the EDA landscape, if at all? Did requirements for EDA change at the edge? I'm just curious on that, and then I had a follow-up for Trac. -- Well, most of the super high-performance computing is reasonably centralized. But it is true that a number of the edge application, if you call a car an edge, there's a lot of computation that's going into that. And so I would say in general, the difference of design is not that marked unless you have two things that changed: one is the need for low power, i.e., battery-operated type things. And so there, you have the never-ending challenge of how much performance can you squeeze out without draining the battery in no time. And that's not a new problem. It really started to come up when mobility came up in the early 2000s. But the other thing is that in a number of edge applications now, these computational devices can be used in machines that can actually be lethal. And a car is definitely potentially lethal but so could be a robot or so. And so with that comes a whole set of other rules that one have to serve in the design of the chips such as having the capability for a chip to diagnose itself as faulty, and in some cases, to diagnose itself and at least temporarily repair itself by having, for example, duplication of some capabilities. Now it took us a while to catch up on all those rules because many of those rules are very old. They come from the automotive industry. But now, and I think we highlighted maybe in the script on automotive, Synopsys is really well on top of this. And so much so that we now participate in the premiums where the next set of rules are being developed and pioneered. So those are sort of the differences. But for the rest, it's like it's never good enough, it's never fast enough. It's never low-power enough. That continues. And while these sound like negative words, they're music to our years. A lot more opportunity for us. -- Got it. That's very helpful, Aart. And then a quick follow-up for Trac. It looks like your fiscal 2020 revenue guide is largely unexpected because of the virus. I understand the stability of your revenue stream, but I would have thought that there would have been some impact on the hardware innovation business, given that's a little more variable. Kind of curious, are you not seeing any of that impact in hardware or emulation? -- Well, our guidance reflects the best information we have right now, and the demand from our customers continues to be very strong. I think part of it is that it's going to be the variability is going to be mostly on the timing of it, but that's contemplated in the guidance. As far as growth goes, keep in mind every year, we look at the year and we say that it's going to be hard to grow off of a record year, which is what we had in 2019. But we feel very good about where we are and the pipeline that we've got in place. -- Thanks Trac. -- You're welcome.We have a question from the line of Josh Tilton with Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Yes, hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, on Software Integrity, just how many months are left on the total Polaris rollout? What key functionality remains to be integrated? And should we expect a step-up in margins once the platform is fully rolled out? -- Maybe it's strange thing to answer, but that rollout will continue, hopefully, for a long, long time, meaning, many years. The reason being that the basic capabilities of Polaris as a platform are there. Now the question is, how well do we integrate multiple applications? And the power of a platform is precisely because it handles multiple applications in a way that makes life much easier for the user instead of having to deal with different products that may have different interfaces, data representations, etc, So what is encouraging is that we now have already multiple capabilities on there. And you may realize that, I mentioned that the Tinfoil acquisition is slated to be integrated next. And so that's a good way to think about it. Hopefully, we can do many more things. Now the platform itself will continue to evolve. They all do and it's hard for me to say what's the life cycle for a platform in this area, which is still new to us. But if you look at sort of EDA, our platforms typically have lasted somewhere between 10 to 15 years. -- And helped drive margin expansion over time as we ramp up on the platform. But it's going to come across from a variety of things, both revenue growth, operating efficiencies and then getting the benefit of the platform. -- That was helpful. And then just following up on Fusion Compiler. Has it been going up head-to-head specifically against Cadence's full digital flow? And if so, how have the win rates been there? -- Well, we really have mostly one competitor in that area and it's a very worthy competitor. So yes, we compete all the time against Cadence. Let me just leave it at the fact that, I think right now, we have a very, very strong capability. -- Thank you very much. -- You're welcome.I'll turn it back over to our speakers. -- Well, with that, thank you for all the questions, and again, thank you for your support. We had a strong quarter. We have a whole rest of the year to go, as you know, and we look forward to talking to you again in the quarter. Be aware that for some of you, we are also available later on after the call.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, edge computing, AR/VR, autonomous vehicles - all technologies set to become more prominent as the new decade progresses. Each has one more thing in common: they all require software to act as the engine keeping them ticking along. Take this idea one step further and it stands to reason that the companies providing software solutions to the tech pioneers will benefit from the new paradigm.Baird analyst  recently pulled the trigger on 2 software stocks, initiating coverage on both. As Baird is ranked second on the list of , it’s worth taking heed when one of the firm’s analysts gets the ball rolling on a new stock.Furthermore, we ran both tickers through the  at TipRanks to confirm that Baird is in the majority on Wall Street in recommending these equities. Here’s what you need to know about them.Let’s start off with Synopsys, a company that provides software and intellectual property solutions for the design and testing of chips (integrated circuits) and computer systems. The company’s technology is present in self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) consumer products.Synopsys stock has been on an almost constant upward trajectory since 2016, culminating in 2019’s market beating 69% gain. The performance has stretched further into 2020, too; Synopsys’ share price is up by 17% year-to-date.Last year’s share price performance was reflected in its business operations, as well; in fiscal 2019, sales grew to $3.4 billion, compared to the previous year’s $3.1 billion. The company expects revenue for fiscal 2020 to come in at around $3.6 billion.Synopsys is the largest provider of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools in the US. EDA is a major component in chip development and its workflows, with the EDA industry’s growth closely aligned with broader semiconductor R&D growth. Following a lean year in 2019, R&D spending looks ready to ramp up again in 2020. As Synopsys is at the forefront of digital design and verificationand most of its clients are in the semiconductor industry, it stands to benefit from these development activities.Baird’s Joseph Vruwink highlights the company’s impressive 2019 and urges investors not to miss an “encore in 2020."" Additionally, the analyst notes accelerating EDA growth, broadening IP opportunity and rising margins are reasons to remain positive on the stock.Vruwink said, “With customers set to accelerate R&D spend during 2020-21 and product innovation creating more avenues for secular growth, Synopsys is positioned to deliver attractive combination of revenue growth (HSD+) and margin expansion (500bp+ opportunity). We believe Fiscal 2020 through 2022 should see operating margin expand from ~25% toward ~30% as Synopsys leverages the significant investment in headcount and personnel-related costs (both organic and inorganic) that took place during recent years.”All of the above led Vruwink to initiate coverage on Synopsys with an Outperform rating along with a price target of $190. Should the target be met, investors stand to take home returns in the shape of 14%. (To watch Vruwink’s track record, )A full house of Buys – 10, in fact – provides the software designer with a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street. The average price target comes in at $169.10 and indicates modest upside of 2%. ()Not to be outdone by Synopsys, fellow EDA software provider Cadence Design Systems has been beating the market, too. The company’s share price is up by 13% year-to-date and continues last year’s excellent performance (the stock rose by 63% in 2019). Investors were buoyed by Cadence’s innovative tech offering, solid financials and long-term growth prospects. Having said that, investors are not the only ones impressed with the San Jose-based company. For the sixth consecutive year, Cadence made Fortune’s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For.The company is also aiming for further expansion outside of its traditional EDA market. Using its technical capabilities, Cadence is pursuing solutions for hardware/software integration and system analysis, focusing on two areas in particular- simulation and embedded security. Vruwink points out that individually, each area has grown at a double digit rate this cycle and provides a multi-billion dollar TAM (total addressable market) opportunity. Add this to an EDA market expected to gain by high single digits, and the two form the basis for the company’s TAM expansion strategy over the next 5-10 years.Vruwink sees targeted IP growth, TAM expansion and acceleration in its core EDA business as key drivers for Cadence this year.The analyst said, “We believe the company is well positioned to outperform in 2020 through a combination of accelerating customer development activity (+ for EDA tools), strong IP momentum (including AI/ML, auto, communications) and continued success in growing system-level tools. We view valuation as reasonable in comparison to other design peers with potential for further re-rating as company executes on secular growth opportunity/ TAM expansion while sustaining strong profitability.”Bottom-line, then? Vruwink initiated coverage of Cadence with an Outperform rating. In addition, the analyst set the price target at $93, indicating potential upside of 16%.Out on the Street, Cadence’s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 7 Buys and 2 Holds. With an average price target of $86.89, analysts expect the next 12 months to provide investors with 9% upside.

There are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Synopsys Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $120.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $171.00.  The standard deviation is $15.254.


But the whole reason to look at the average SNPS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with SNPS crossing above that average target price of $153.12/share, investors in SNPS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $153.12 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Synopsys Inc:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

"Investors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2020 expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $131.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $137.91/share today.

Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.59% return on the cash commitment, or 17.85% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $137.91/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.63% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.12% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.47% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 27%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 26%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $137.91) to be 25%.

he  () is up 58.30 percent year-to-date, a staggering ascent and one that puts the benchmark semiconductor exchange traded fund (ETF) ahead of the S&P 500 by a better than 2-to-1 margin.Assuming SOXX, which tracks the widely followed PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index, trades flat the rest of this year (it probably won't), chip stocks have their work cut out when it comes to mirroring 2019's bullishness in 2020. For SOXX to get anywhere in the ballpark of this year's surge in 2020, that effort will likely boil down to two factors: chip demand and the subsequent earnings generated by companies in this space.“To keep the rally going, semiconductor companies will need to start posting better-than-expected financial results, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, who was one of the first analysts on Wall Street to get cautious on the group in the second half of 2018,” Demand is expected to be decent in the year ahead. The highly anticipated 5G rollout will happen, likely bolstering the case for communications chips, the need for  chips remains strong and SOXX could also benefit from a video game hardware upgrade cycle later in the year.While there are credible reasons to believe semiconductor demand will, at the very least, be steady in 2020, investors will pay up for the privilege of entertaining that thesis. As the chart below indicates, the PHLX Semiconductor Index is as richly valued as it has been in a decade. and , a pair of this year's chip stars and two stocks that combine for over 13 percent of the SOXX roster, reflect the frothy valuations currently found in Chip Land. Nvidia trades at 30.30x next year's earnings, cheap compared to the 37.45x found on rival AMD.However, there's also a twist to the semiconductor equity thesis: some of these stocks, including high-flying Nvidia are actually under-owned by professional investors.“Bank of America says several major semiconductor companies are under-owned by funds, creating an ‘attractive opportunity,’” .Nvidia is up almost 68 percent this year and, somehow, that stock's ownership level among active fund managers is quite low.That name owned by 28% of fund managers with 0.90x weighting (vs. semis at 1.19x)” while “BofA also sees  as ‘particularly attractive’ since the company is “under-owned and underweight” by funds,” according to Seeking Alpha. “also makes the list with only 11.6% fund ownership.”KLA is the tenth-largest component in SOXX at a weight of nearly 4%.In the third quarter, 75% of SOXX components reported better-than-expected earnings and sales with joining that group late Thursday. Last month,  forecast first-quarter forecast adjusted earnings of 87 cents to 95 cents a share on sales of $3.95 billion to $4.25 billion, well ahead of the 74 cents a share on revenue of $3.71 billion Wall Street was expecting.Those stocks combine for almost 12% of SOXX and while that's just two stocks, they could be setting the stages for decent chip earnings next year. That's important because data suggest revenue growth will be there.“Following a 12.8 plunge in 2019, global semiconductor market revenue will rebound to 5.9 percent growth in 2020—an 18-percentage point swing,” . “Global revenue will rise to $448 billion next year, up from $422.8 billion in 2019. The deployment of 5G will be the main factor propelling this recovery—not only because of the renewed growth it will bring to the wireless industry—but also due to the wider benefits the wireless technology will bestow on global businesses and economies.”The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@For Semiconductor ETFs in 2020, It'll be All About Demand And Earnings@2019-12-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/for-semiconductor-etfs-in-2020-itll-be-all-about-demand-and-earnings-2019-12-13

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q4 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Synopsys  for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am. -- Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release.In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com.In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report another excellent quarter and with it an outstanding year for Synopsys. In fiscal 2019, a year in which we successfully navigated several external challenges, we once again exceeded our plan. We generated $3.36 billion in revenue and are well on track to our next milestone of $4 billion. Our backlog grew to $4.4 billion. We expanded operating margin significantly and delivered 17% non-GAAP earnings growth to $4.56 for the year, while returning $329 million to shareholders through buybacks. Business was strong across our Semiconductor & System Design segment and strengthened as the year progressed. Software Integrity achieved profitability and grew 19% to $335 million. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.Against a challenging  backdrop with geopolitical stress and unevenness in the semiconductor industry, design activity remains strong. Growth in machine learning, automotive 5G, IoT, cloud and the proliferation of Smart Everything is considerable. New entrants including AI start-ups and cloud hyperscalers are pushing the boundaries of technology and time to market. Synopsys is at the center of this wave of innovation and growth, and we are uniquely positioned to enable electronics design from the intricacies and complexity of silicon to the power and pervasiveness of software.A year ago, I communicated our strategy for our next phase of growth. First, sustain and grow our technology and market leadership in EDA and IP. Second, continue to scale and grow Software Integrity in a diverse customer base at new TAM, while steadily moving to solid profitability. And third, further drive operational excellence toward multi-year operating margin expansion. During fiscal '19, we made very good progress on all three.Let me provide some highlights beginning with EDA and IP, where we substantially expanded relationships with our customers and ecosystem partners. TSMC, for example, recognized Synopsys with Partner of the Year Awards for the ninth straight year. Award this year were for Interface IP, joint development of 6-nanometer design infrastructure, joint delivery of innovative 3D chip stacking and cloud-based productivity solutions. In addition, some of the world's largest and most influential companies expanded their reliance on us. One key example is the US mobile systems leader, who significantly expanded its business with us across both EDA and IP.In EDA, our platforms increasingly stand out as the strongest they've ever been. This year, we began proliferating several game-changing new products that already have significant momentum. Notably, our unrelenting innovation push in digital design is driving benchmark wins and increased competitive displacements. Our Fusion platform, including our new Fusion Compiler product launched last November is achieving widespread wins and growing deployment, exceeding our initial business targets.Fusion Compiler is winning head to head benchmarks with consistently better results and run time across many applications. Breakthrough competitive wins have ranged from the largest global communications, processor and graphics firms to high impacts cloud hyperscalers to multiple influential system houses such as a large global consumer electronics company for image sensor designs, a leading automotive semiconductor company for autonomous driving SoC designs, and expanded competitive displacements at a leading mobile company for 5-nanometer and sub 5-nanometer designs.Benchmark wins at a US-based graphics company with superior quality of results and turnaround time, a large cap US systems company selecting Fusion Compiler as its primary solution for digital implementation, and the US semiconductor leader who is aggressively expanding deployment of Fusion Compiler for its mission critical programs representing more than 95% of its business. While still early in our multi-year product cycle, these important wins represent significant momentum and usage share gains, setting the stage for revenue share gains going forward.Turning to custom design, Custom Compiler revenue nearly doubled this year, fueled by multiple full-flow competitive displacements. Our expansion is driven by key wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets, including a Tier 1 North American server company, a large US high-speed communications chip maker and complete full-flow competitive displacements at a large IDM in Japan and a major DRAM company. We also announced a full-flow Custom Compiler platform deployment at Samsung for its five LPE process and are seeing good momentum with start-ups, who are not locked into a legacy flows and demand modern technology.Let me now move to our Verification Continuum platform, where we hold the Number 1 market share position in both software and hardware. Benefiting from native integration of the fastest engines on the market, our verification software products continue to drive competitive wins and proliferation. Contributing substantially to growth are broad set of system houses and chipmakers ranging from cloud hyperscalers in North America to AI, automotive, mobile and memory leaders around the world.Hardware-based verification was strong as well. Despite our largest hardware customer delaying delivery of a substantial number of emulators due to near-term spending priorities, we finished the year with a record hardware revenue. We maintain the Number 1 market segment position for the third year in a row. Our hardware products are particularly well suited to today's complex designs with unmatched speed, highest capacity, lowest cost of ownership and lowest power consumption. As a result, we significantly expanded our customer base, adding nearly 40 new customers and more than 80 repeat orders in 2019. We saw major expansions and share gains at influential customers ranging from prominent global systems companies to growing hyperscalers and leading semis. AMD, for example, standardized on ZeBu, expanding the emulation capacity to accelerate time to market for processor, graphics and gaming chips.Now to IP. With strong market demand and our rich portfolio are driving double-digit growth. We had a record year, reaching more than $750 million in revenue, with prominent engagements across all major markets, including AI, automotive, cloud and 5G. As the Number 1 provider of interface, embedded memory and foundry-specific IP, we provide the industry's broadest portfolio to address today's most complex design requirements, accelerate time to market and lower risk for customers. We have particular strengths in USB, memory interfaces and PCI Express 5.0.This year, we achieved the significant milestone of $1 billion in cumulative USB IP bookings, bolstering our position as the Number 1 USB provider by far. And our new 56 and 112 gig SerDes IP is gaining good market traction. During 2019, momentum accelerated in automotive where we've achieved nearly 230 automotive socket wins and advanced FinFET processes across approximately 30 major semiconductor companies. We announced the collaboration with Infineon to incorporate the ARC embedded vision processor into their next-generation Rx controller to accelerate AI in automotive applications. From the embedded vision alliance, we were awarded the Best Process Award for 2019.Finally, our track record of delivering IP and advanced process nodes continues and is highly valued by our customers. We achieved more than 250 IP wins on TSMC's 7-nanometer FinFET process and announced the collaboration with TSMC for development of IP on their most advanced 5-nanometer process, where we signed yet another significant multi-year agreement with a very large global customer. We're also seeing great momentum with Samsung Foundry process down to four LPE and global foundries across a range of processes.Now to Software Integrity, the tools that test software code for security vulnerabilities and quality issues. We entered this new TAM in 2014. By the end of 2018, we had completed a number of significant acquisitions, integrated them into Synopsys and enhanced our products with new features and broader language coverage. In 2019, we completed Phase 1 of our Software Integrity strategy by delivering 10% of Synopsys' revenue and achieving approximately 10% operating margin. Although orders were a bit softer than planned, we outpaced the market with 19% growth. This was achieved through progress in driving multi-year multi-million dollar agreements, a steady increase in the number of customers adopting multiple solutions and growth in all of our key verticals.In 2020, we are now moving to Phase 2, scaling the business to $0.5 billion and beyond. The opportunity is vast as companies must embed security testing into their software development process without compromising time to market. Synopsys is well positioned to enable this evolution with a great combination of high-value products and consulting services.Our scaling efforts for 2020 span three areas. One, expanding Polaris, our cloud-based Software Integrity platform. We announced Polaris in Q2, including a compelling road map of product integrations and new capabilities over the subsequent 12 to 18 months. We've had a growing number of adoptions thus far,, including a Fortune 500 insurance company and customers ranging from financial services to networking to medical and industrial digitalization. Stay tuned as we expand the Polaris capabilities and enhance support of large deployments.Two, scaling consulting engagements. This is where we help our customers with high-level benchmarking, program development advice, as well as large product deployments. It's a key Synopsys differentiator in the software and DevOps market.And three, refining our channel. We've realigned our sales organization to better serve large enterprise customers, key market verticals and new regional business. In FY '20, we intend to further increase both our sales and support capacity. We believe we are on track to exceed market growth in this business, delivering approximately 15% to 20% growth over the next couple of years as the market evolves. For 2020, we plan to hold non-GAAP operating margin roughly steady then resume expansion in 2021 and beyond.For Synopsys as a whole. In FY '20, we expect solid revenue growth even as we exclude from our forecast any revenue from companies currently on the US government's Entity List. Furthermore, we plan substantial non-GAAP operating margin expansion, mid-teens earnings-per-share growth and strong operating cash flow.In summary, we executed very well in 2019, delivering financial results substantially above beginnings of year targets. Market demand is strong and we are well positioned. Our product platforms are driving benchmark wins and competitive displacements. And we are driving continued financial execution and growth. As we move into the holiday season, I want to thank our employees for their innovative and hard work and our partners and customers for their continued commitment to our products and trust in Synopsys.With that, I'll turn it over to Trac. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was a very strong year. In spite of what was at times a tough macro environment, we achieved record results in all key metrics and finish well ahead of our initial expectations. We delivered these results despite multiple unique hurdles, including the operational transition to ASC 606, the US Entity List and general geopolitical uncertainty around the world. We delivered strong growth in revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow, while expanding non-GAAP operating margin by almost 3 percentage points.We're entering 2020 well positioned to continue our momentum. Our product portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, which in combination with healthy design activity is driving robust demand. The result is reflected in our backlog, which ended the year at $4.4 billion up from $4.1 billion at the end of 2018 despite the ASC 606 backlog deduction. Our results speak to our solid execution and the durability of the business we built. Within approximately 90% recurring revenue model, a diversified customer base spanning multiple key verticals and geographies and a product portfolio consisting of mission critical tools, we are confident in our ability to deliver growth even in the context of an uneven macroeconomic environment.I will now review our full year 2019 results. We generated total revenue of $3.36 billion, 8% growth or 9% adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2018. Semiconductor & System Design revenue was $3.03 billion, an increase of 7% or 8% adjusting for the extra week with both product groups contributing to the strong results. IP reported a strongest year-to-date and EDA software continues to grow well within our mid-to-high single-digit target range.Revenue had another record year, reflecting the broad-based strength of that business. We again earned the Number 1 market segment position as growth in our diversified customer base more than offset a decline in emulation revenue from our largest hardware customers. Excluding hardware, revenue from that customer grew very well. The Software Integrity segment generated revenue of $335 million, 19% growth or 20% adjusting for the extra week. As Aart discussed, 2019 marks the key milestones, as we grew the business to approximately 10% of total revenue, a solid profitability.Returning to the consolidated level, total GAAP costs and expenses were $2.84 billion, which includes approximately $47 million in restructuring costs as we work to optimize our resource allocation for sustainable long-term growth. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $2.52 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25%. For our segments, adjusted operating margins were 26.7% for Semiconductor & System Design and 9.6% for Software Integrity. GAAP earnings per share were $3.45 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.56, 17% growth or 19% adjusting for the extra week.Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was $801 million. We completed buybacks of $329 million in the year and $1.8 billion over the past five years, returning approximately 75% of our free cash flow to investors over that period. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $729 million and total debt of $138 million.Now to our targets, which assumed no change in the US government's Entity List during the year. Based on our current assessment of the timing of hardware and IP deliveries, we expect the first half, second half split of roughly 45%, 55% for revenue and 35%, 65% for EPS, due to more evenly distributed expenses. For fiscal 2020, revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.934 billion and $2.983 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.63 billion and $2.66 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%; other income and expenses between minus $16 million and minus $12 million; our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $3.72 per share to $3.90 per sharel non-GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share and $5.25 per share; cash flow from operations of $800 million to $825 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $180 million, as project timing costs some of the spending plan for 2019 to push into 2020. We expect expenditures to decline in 2021.Now, to the targets for the first quarter. Revenue between $805 million and $835 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $715 million and $744 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $635 million and $655 million, other income expenses between minus $5 million and minus $3 million, our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.43 to $0.54 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.89 to $0.94 per share.In summary, our results this year reflect our strong execution and the resiliency of our business model. Our strength came from across the portfolio as we exceeded our near-term commitments and made significant progress on our longer-term operating objectives. As we look to 2020 and beyond, our focus remains consistent, strong execution to deliver on our long-term targets of high single-digit revenue growth, sustained margin expansion to the high 20s in FY '21 and 30% longer-term, double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth and strong cash flow. These metrics, combined with the capital allocation strategy built on balancing internal investments, M&A and buybacks give us confidence in our ability to continue to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value.With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.[Operator Instructions] And we first turn to the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thank you. Good afternoon. Based on your annual profile or half-to-half profile, looks like you must be expecting significantly stronger hardware at least beyond the first quarter. Can you talk about if that's the case and what kind of visibility you have to that hardware ramp and if that includes a significant pickup from the large customer that was down last year and the hardware shipments? -- Hi, Rich. That's part of it. Yes, it's a combination of both IP and hardware deliveries that is affecting the quarterly profile. -- Got it. And can you just talk about your visibility to that, is that something that's kind of in backlog or how -- what are sort of underpins the visibility, particularly the hardware since that tends to be a little more volatile than the subscription revenues? -- Yes, you've taken a good point, which is that hardware and IP generally is more more variable from quarter to quarter. And the way that we're projecting revenues for this year is no different than how we have done in the past. It's a combination of what is in backlog, as well as our assessment of our ability to close the deals that are in our pipeline and both in IP and hardware. So, it really does reflect our best estimate of the profile at this point. -- Great. Just quickly, it looks like SIG was a little bit light in the fourth quarter and you've moderated, I think, your longer-term target that had been 20% is now 15% to 20%. Is there anything structural you're seeing in that business? Or there is sort of large numbers as you grow it? How should we -- what accounts for that sort of moderation of that growth target there? Thank you. -- Yes. Rich, that's a good point. I'll start with the second half of your question, which is, is there any fundamental change in the business? And we don't see it that way. Certainly, we're very optimistic about that business and we do see a good outlook for it. We did see some challenges this year, which we were quick to address and we feel good that we should be able to continue to grow at the market rates or higher. And it is natural to us, it's a -- the natural ebbs and flows of growing the business. -- Great, thank you. Congratulations on a good year. -- Thank you. -- Thank you, Rich .We have a question from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Mr. Steves, your line is open. You might have your phone muted. -- Hey, sorry about that. Can you hear me? -- Hi, Mitch. -- Now we can. -- Sorry about that. So, I have really two questions. Unfortunately at the pick on track a little bit here, but, so if I look at the numbers from the guide you guys are giving us like kind of like 21%, 22% operating margin for Q1, but that implies the kind of the rest of the year that Q2 to Q4 is going to be around 28.6%. So wouldn't that mean that basically by '21, you're kind of getting close to high 20s starting the year or am I doing the math incorrectly there? -- Well, certainly for the full year, we expect to be around 27% operating margin. As we've said in the past, the quarterly profile is really an outcome of the plan. Candidly, when I think about the budget for FY '21, 99% of my time is really been focused on the full-year plan and making sure that we've got an outlook for revenue growth that is sustaining where we are and are accelerating some areas, and then making sure that we're investing in the appropriate places, while simultaneously improving margins for this year.The outcome of the quarterly profile really is just the timing of these deals. So I wouldn't read too much into the quarterly profile, and I'll close it out by saying, we remain committed to our long-term commitment of high 20s in FY '21 and we will comment on that further as the year progresses. -- Okay. And the second one to add is you guys did have done a few smaller acquisitions lately and that includes employee headcount. And so all of that is encapsulated in the full year guide, you guys are giving correct meaning that there's going to be no additional OpEx in that number? -- Yes, that's correct. -- Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. -- All right.We turn to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.Tom Diffely, you might have your line on mute. -- Yes, hello, can you hear me? -- Yes, we can. -- All sorts [Indecipherable] comes today. Yes, so just a quick question. When you look at the outlook for 2020 and the nice margin profile, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, how would you split the margin growth from product mix versus overhead absorption versus potentially a fine tune cost structure? -- It's really kind of across the Board. The progress that we made this year in 2019 in terms of improving it by 3 percentage points really came across all areas of the business. We saw it across the different business groups from sales from the G&A functions. And it's really a continued and broad-based effort. For 2020 and beyond that we'll continue to do the same thing. It's really fine tuning across all areas of the business. -- Okay, great. And then when you look at items like IP and hardware that tend to be a little lumpier, is there any other -- are there any trends in 2020 we should know about as far as it can be fourth quarter weighted, it can be even after the first quarter, any other kind of trends on a quarterly basis? -- We could probably help you with the quarterly profile in detail, but Q4 would likely tend to be the highest quarter for us given what we are -- what our visibility is at this point from both IP and hardware. -- Okay. And then final question. Is IP fairly seasonal at this point? I feel like it's always a little bit higher in the second half of the year. -- We're not really seeing much seasonality in the business. And as we said, it really depends on the timing of when the IP has delivered or when the IP is pulled down by our customers. And you're going to see that variability increase due to 606. So, just keep that in mind, but overall, the demand drivers for IP continues to be really strong and that's reflected in our outlook for 2020. -- Great, thanks for your time today. -- All right. Thanks, Tom.And next, we turn to the line of Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you just help us understand, I don't know if you guide out this far, but the revenue growth you expect by product group for fiscal '20, is it kind of in line with the longer-term targets you set out or is there any substantial deviation in any particular product group? Thank you. -- No, our long-term model spells it out pretty well between EDA, IP and Software Integrity. And typically, we don't break that down quarterly or on an annual basis. Our view is we do manage this business over a multi-year horizon and the beauty of it is that we have been pretty good about managing it within that range over time. -- Got it. And the reason why I guess I asked that is because, there has been some weaker data points on enterprise spending overall. I'd imagine you are a bit more insulated from that given the relative size of your SIG business but are you seeing any kind of impact from that going into fiscal '20 or again, are you insulated from that? Thank you. -- Those sort of concerns are certainly factored into our guidance. I would reference you to how we performed historically and that's the great part of having a business that is close to 90% recurring is that there is adapting effect when things go through different cycles. -- The other thing I would add to that is, certainly, if you look at the Software Integrity business, it's a business where we're actually very young in an emerging situation and so there are many, many customers that we haven't even touched yet. And so I think that is a fairly open space. Now overall, obviously, we're are subject to the fluctuations of the global markets. But from a technology utilization point of view right now, I think the demand for technology is quite high. And so the rates continues to be quite fast. -- Great, thanks. I'll get back in the queue.And next, we turn to the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hey, everyone. I appreciate you taking the question. It looks like you're not going to file your 10-K until January 1. So I was hoping that on this call, you can share with us your next 12-month backlog, which excludes non-cancelable FSA and future royalties? -- We actually don't disclose that information. What? -- In the K. -- In the K, we will discuss that. Do you have that number? I'm sorry, I don't have that number off the top of my head. -- Okay. Part of the question is, is that it looks like you could take you next 12-month backlog as you've been disclosed in your recent SEC filings and you divide that by your next 12 months revenue expectations, which is I think the critical juncture now. It looks like you're generating more revenue or expect to generate more revenue from next 12-month backlog. So, just hoping that maybe you can speak to, why you guys are sort of modeling in lower turns business as it relates to that? -- Well, I'll give you some specific numbers around that. The backlog that we have scheduled for FY '20 is roughly 65%, that's lower than it's traditionally been, mostly because of the transition to 606 and with a hard -- higher mix of hardware and IP. From a modeling perspective, when we take take into account what we have visibility to from hardware and IP. The range and -- the range of how we're building the business between backlog and turns and what we have visibility to is pretty consistent with what we've been managing to over the last few years. -- Okay. And could you give us an update on the degree of the impact from the Entity List, not specific to maybe the one big customer, but maybe in the entirety? -- Well, in general, as you know, we don't disclose the specific customers, nor do we disclose the subset of customers. Obviously, it has a negative impact, but at the same time, the guidance that we gave, which I think is rather strong has fully encompass the facts that we assuming zero return or zero revenue from the Entity List customers. So if things change for the better, we will let you know of course immediately. But for right now, the wisest path is to not comment much more about the situation. -- Okay, alright. Didn't you comment in the past that it could be 100 basis point impact to the top line? -- No, we have not provided specific numbers around that. -- Okay. Alright. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. -- You're welcome.Next, we turn to line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. Good evening guys. First question is on the delay in the emulation and hardware, is this something that's just absolutely single customer specific or is it possible that it could be some symptom of a broader trend? -- It was single customer specific. -- Okay. Okay. Any -- just to follow up on that, any additional color on that, I mean, why the delay? Do you expected in, I think Rich asked earlier, what -- you expected in the first half or when the actual delivery will be, but any additional color you can give there? -- No, we don't want to give color, because as you know, we always very cautious to not comment about specific customers. Maybe I can give a little color in a different dimension, which is we were quite diligent at finding opportunities to grow in a broader set of markets. And actually, if you look at our verification area and specifically the hardware, we did really, really well. And so, we have no doubt that the capabilities we offer, the very need for a lot of customers to run their software on prototypes where they don't have the real hardware yet, continues to be a great opportunity for us and we continue to both invest there and are bullish about the broader customer sets that we have. -- Okay, thank you. That is actually helpful color. Then, switching gears to the Integrity business, the refining of the sales channel and looking to scale this thing to $500 million and beyond. So what do you think in the sales channel or sales processes needed to be refined relative to what you're doing in 2019? Any additional specifics you can give there? -- Well, let me just take a first step back, given that we've had the unique experience of growing Synopsys literally through these phases as well. And I'm always thrilled by the fact that enterprises do go through different phases. And so, the $50 million company is very different than the $100 million and that in term is very different than the $0.25 billion [Phonetic], and $500 million again is different. And the difference is essentially the complexity of how you manage not only internal product development and management, but also the external relationship with the customers.And this is certainly also true in the case of the Software Integrity group, because there too, there is also a bifurcation between large enterprise customers that typically are cautious and slow in adopting, but when they adopt they keep adopting and keep adopting and so they become over time the biggest spenders, versus many of the smaller agile companies that very quickly buy a few copies and then it's more ad hoc, how they expand. On top of that, you have the gradual broadening of geography, any of the start-ups that we acquired originally had certain geographies that they were focused on, we of course, are a global company and therefore open up broader domains.And then the third one, which is maybe more marked here that was in the semiconductor domain we originally was in -- were in is that they deal with individual verticals. And so, dealing with automotive is different than dealing with the financial sector or the health sector and so on. And so, you have sort of these multiple variables and now the question is, how do you deploy and manage your salespeople and support people, I should say against that backdrop of multiple dimensions? And that's just another way of saying, one continually learns and evolves and as we are looking now to Phase 2, which is the crossing of the $0.5 billion and beyond, that is essentially what we are talking about when we are saying, we have the opportunity to optimize our go-to-market again. And no doubt in 1.5 years, we will say it again. -- Okay, all right. Thank you. -- You're welcome.And next, we turn to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. I'll ask both questions at the same time. First for you, Aart and then for, Trac. Aart, following up on the conversation we had when you were here in New York a couple of months ago, regarding the next big thing in EDA, you answered that prototyping, broadly speaking and new requirement and extraction would be the next growth driver for EDA. And by that you meant of course, not just hardware prototyping. And my question is, is this already showing itself in new business and how are you investing toward that since it's likely to be a multi-year phenomenon?And then secondly for Trac, you spoke of your largest customer in two separate ways, but we combine that and could you talk about the total business from the largest customer? In fiscal '18, according to last year's K, it was 15.4% of your business which worked out to just over $480 million and that was flat with '17, which have been up very strongly. So, many and now everything you just said about customer, did your business in fact grow either proportionately or in absolute terms? Thanks. -- Okay, Jay. The next big thing and of course, next is always a function of short-term, long-term, medium-term, you name it. But we have to say, I sort of agree with my answer that I gave you a number of months ago, which is that the more systems we complex, the more it's necessary to essentially build mark-ups, we call those prototypes of them to see how well they work, because the working is often illustrated on how well the software runs and the challenges may very well be inside of the hardware.But in other words, you always have a very complex modeling proposition of how do you create a prototype of the hardware, the level of abstraction of the hardware to use that word and then run software on its agency, how fast is it? How much power does it consume, or there weird stops? What happens if something breaks, can you restart it if it's in the middle of some lock-up of things like that. And these things become a dramatically more important if the systems also impact life dangerous situations, such as driving a car or operating as some machinery. And it is very clear that a lot of the world is going is actually in that direction. So, how well have we done with that. Well, initially, we went after some markets that was considered to be extremely slow moving in stodgy and that was the automotive market, and that's quite radically changed a few years ago when two things happened. One is a car got ha.ed,. Jeep and it was literally driven off the street by somebody using a cellphone. And secondly people suddenly saw the coming about of autonomous driving with all the potential and the challenges for security and safety.And it's been quite remarkable to see how the OEMs. So these are the end car companies have in term pushed on their Tier 1, which is their supply chain, which in terms pushes on the semiconductor guys which is their supply chain to now start putting all of these capabilities in model, so that they can assemble at long before the car is actually already has a prototype. And so we've been central to that and it's been quite rewarding to see how quickly this has advanced on an industry that fundamentally for good reason has to be slow, because it has to be safe.Now the concept I just described, actually happens in all of the more sophisticated electronic systems and this is only true also for a cellular phone that has a very short time to market where one can run the software on an emulator for example and actually discover surprises before I actually ships the product. So, that is one of the many directions that we are going into and it literally takes advantage of our entire stack of relationships in the supply chain and stack of relationships in the technology levels. -- Hi, Jay. This is Trac. So to your second question, you will see in our 10-K filing in a couple of weeks that the revenue for our largest customer will be down in 2019, and that is strictly a function of the hardware decline. The rest of the business, EDA and IP, grew very well in 2019. -- Got it. Thank you. If I could squeeze in one more, perhaps, regarding your headcount. Your number of AE openings has increased significantly and particularly in the Americas where they've nearly tripled over the last year and up by about 60% over the last year in Asia, flat in EMEA. So, maybe comment on what's driving that growth in AE rex? And is it coincidental indicator or leading indicator? How are you thinking about filling what is your second largest function by openings after R&D? -- Jay, you always give me the best summary of our hiring practices. But the increase of AEs invariably has to do with either products that are in deployment and need support as we harvest the opportunity and that's certainly the case in areas such as Fusion Compiler, custom and many of the place of verification, or it is a gradual rebalancing of the geography make up as different parts of the world grow different rates or have different needs at various times. It is rarely the needs to increase specific skills, because our teams are actually quite strong and very broad, but every so often, bringing in some specialists, let's say, for example, in the prototyping or in the intersection of hardware and software can be quite beneficial as well.So, the fact that we are hiring, I think you can take as a positive in general and adding much more, it probably enters the competitive knowledge space, I'll refrain from that. Thank you. -- Thank you.[Operator Instructions] Next, we turn to the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. One, kind of tying back to Aart's comments about the SIG margins, 27% operating margin guidance for full year, on track to do the high 20s in fiscal '21. But how should we think about the design margins versus SIG margins? Because I think, Aart, you said that margins won't be as expensive in 2020, but then ramp again in 2021. -- Yes, that's correct. I think we said that we hold SIG probably roughly flat and now of course that means if the rest of the ops margin for the Company growth and everybody has to chip in. And we have obviously multiple parts in the Company, everybody is sensitized to the operating margin that we want to achieve for the Company. And so all of the BUs and subgroups are all focusing on how do we get there, while at the same time not making any compromises for future growth.And so, you are probably aware that somewhat loosely, we used the rule of 40 as a guideline and so there is room for people to make improvements to get there. But on a strongly positive note, I think, Synopsys throughout management is not only sensitize to this desire, but very committed and has budget and plans to get there. So, from year to year, I think different BUs will get a little bit more or less of a reprieve as a function of the investment needed or corrections or whatever else we need to do, but in aggregate, we all know that we want to deliver on the numbers that we are guiding you toward. -- Okay, great. And then maybe a little more clarification if you can on some of the fiscal responsibility you'd see in your EDA side, because the guidance would suggest most of that improvement would have to come from that business? -- Well, realize, of course, that if figures roughly 10% of Synopsys is tuned by definition, the rest of 90%, and we have multiple very different efforts in EDA and we have a relatively large, but still less than a quarter of the Company IP business. And so obviously, between those different groupings, they all have to contribute. And if I'm not mistaken, all but one of the businesses are heading toward improving ops margin, one of them is heading a little bit more toward growing the revenue, but in aggregate, and it's sometimes difficult to measure because they intertwine in the deals and so on. But in aggregate, it's all heading in the same direction, which has put a dent in the rule of 40. -- Great, thank you. I appreciate the color. -- You're welcome.Next, we turn to the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. -- Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Aart, I think in your prepared comments, you said the SIG group could be $0.5 billion in revenues next year. If that is the case, it looks like your Semi and Systems division going to grow only like 3%, which seems lower than historical. Is that a function of the Entity List or is there anything else going on there? And then I have a follow-up. -- Sorry, if I was not clear enough, but my statement was that the next milestone is to pass $0.5 billion. I did not say that it would pass $1 billion next year. And so, we gave you a sense of the growth rate for SIG at 15% to 20%, which we think is a bit above the markets that it is in right now. And so, fundamentally, there is no real change in the past that Synopsys is on and all its components from what we did this year and the past year. We're fortunate to have a set of businesses that are all doing well, some are very profitable also. And so it's an aggregate improvement that manifest itself in the financial result largely because of many years of big investments and a number of, I think, really good acquisitions that got integrated well. So, we are continuing the pathway and if you want to get a different sense of Synopsys, then just graph our results over the last 10 years and then you'll see a very different level of stability of how we manage the Company. -- Got it. It's very helpful, Aart. And then just as a follow up, a much more longer-term industry question. Given you guys have a good portion of FPGA, HAPS, hardware and also you completed the acquisition of the DINI Group recently, I'm kind of curious from your vantage point and it looks like five years or more than five years out, where do you stand on the durability of FPGAs for AI applications? Reduced down on the FPGA versus SIG debate. -- Well, the AI field itself is a field that has its own specialty and many, many companies that all making different bets. And it's useful to take a small step backwards, which is fundamentally, AI has one need, which is much, much, much, much, much faster computation. Well, no matter how hard we push on Moore's Law and so on, that's hard to achieve. And so the answer by definition has to be therefore, architectures will become optimized for different applications. Now, architectures can mean chips, it can be groups of chips, it can be FPGAs, it can be a combination of things. And actually a number of the very large suppliers who provide combinations of processors together was graphics processors together was FPGA pieces, all with one objective optimize for an architecture that's appropriate for specific situation.And so, in many ways, we ourselves have been a user of these capabilities, because of course, we use a lot of computation for our software tools. But the hardware tools that we provide is our own way to say for certain tasks, such as for simulation, we can do much better on an emulator or FPGA board. So, I expect all of these technologies to continue to evolve to continue to be available in various combinations and the race will continually be on of how do you build machines that can do really well.My last comment is, we ourselves are the provider of tools to a vast, vast group of emerging AI companies. And this is encouraging, because I think those people will not give up for quite a while in trying new architectures and some will ultimately go into very large volume. And so, in many ways, we see a number of those companies as hard technology drivers for Synopsys. And business wise, we're doing very well with them. -- Thanks, Aart. -- You welcome.And speakers, we have no further questions in queue. -- Well, given that, as you heard, we had a very strong '19. We have a great outlook for '20. The market around us, which was a bit soft last year, looks up slight bit. There are a lot of uncertainties as we all know, but meanwhile, I think we're executing well and this is also a good time to say thank you to you for your support. You're often provocative and stimulating questions and we'll be back with some of you in the next half hour or so. Thank you.It does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

"hat is it that makes a stock a ""solar stock?"" What is it that defines ""best?""In one sense, I suppose you could say that Elon Musk's   has been the best solar stock of the decade. After all, even if it's best known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric cars, Tesla also owns a , building and selling equipment to harvest (solar panels) and store (electric batteries) energy from the sun. And if you're defining ""best"" as ""producing the biggest stock profits,"" Tesla has been by far the best performing solar stock of the decade, growing 1,876% in value since its IPO on June 29, 2010 .But even as a lawyer, I was never a huge fan of open and shut cases. (Too obvious. Too boring.) So instead of focusing on Tesla, let's examine three companies that fit the bill as ""solar stocks"" in more interesting ways, and that have also done pretty well for their shareholders over the past decade:  ,  , and  .Based on a screen of several solar power-related companies and comparing their performance over the last 10 years, it turns out that -- aside from Tesla -- these three have been the best performers. Image source: Getty Images.I first became familiar with Synopsys some two decades ago while doing legal work for the company. I was intrigued by the business, and I've kept tabs on Synopsys off and on  as it evolved from a relatively simple play on the software used to operate machinery manufacturing computer chips into a bona fide play on .As a maker of software products used to design and test integrated circuits, Synopsys is best recognized as a supplier to the computer chip and LED industries. But semiconductors are integral to the operation of solar cells as well, and Synopsys offers multiple products supporting this industry, including: Synopsys doesn't break out its financial results by industry, but even what it does tell us indicates that the business is growing nicely. Revenue grew nearly 150% over the past decade, from $1.4 billion in 2009 to $3.4 billion over the past 12 reported months. Net income has more than tripled to $532 million. And free cash flow is coming along for the ride -- up more than 200% from $200 million in cash profit generated in 2009 to more than $600 million over the past year.And the stock price? Since the end of 2009, Synopsys stock has recorded a gain of 555%, closing above $134 a share last week.Another perhaps below-the-radar solar play worth highlighting here is Applied Materials. If Synopsys is far up the solar supply chain -- supplying the software that runs the machines that make the photovoltaics that form the cells that convert sunlight to energy -- then Applied Materials, which makes chip manufacturing , is at least  to the solar end user.It's also been a pretty terrific stock for investors to own this past decade. From 2009 to the last 12 months, Applied Materials nearly tripled its sales to $14.6 billion, and moved from a net loss ($305 million in 2009) to a net profit -- $2.7 Free cash flow has risen in tandem, from about $84 million in cash generated a decade ago to just over $2.8 billion over the last four reported quarters.Stock-wise, Applied Materials shares have also performed well -- up 313%. And yet, at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 20, they remain significantly cheaper than Synopsys (which trades for more than 38 times earnings). That's surprising, given that analysts polled by  have both companies growing earnings at roughly the same rate over the next five years -- 14.3% annually for Synopsys, and 14.% for Applied Materials.It may also mean that over the  decade, Applied Materials has the better chance of delivering above-average profits to investors.Last but not least, we come to SolarEdge -- incidentally, the only one of these three stocks that I own in personal stock portfolio. Also incidentally, SolarEdge is the only one of the three that hasn't actually been publicly traded for a full 10 years.SolarEdge  in March 2015 -- but it's already giving other solar stocks a run for their money. Despite having half the time to work with, it's up 304% in less than five years, and neck and neck with Applied Materials in delivering profits to investors.How has SolarEdge done this? The maker of inverters that convert direct current solar-generated electricity into the alternating current that charges your iPhone has nearly quadrupled its sales since 2015, pulling down $1.3 billion in revenue over the last 12 months. Profits are up 5x in the same period -- $107 million -- and free cash flow has gone from barely breakeven to nearly $175 million generated over the past year.Going forward, Wall Street analysts see SolarEdge continuing to outgrow other solar stocks. Its earnings are projected to grow 22% annually over the next five years. Whether that will be fast enough to justify the stock's heady 38x P/E ratio remains to be seen. But given the fabulous returns SolarEdge has already generated for stockholders, there's no arguing the company hasn't delivered in spades already -- and earned its place among the best solar stocks of the decade.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2020 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new June 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $130.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $130.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $121.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $134.91/share today.

Because the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.92% return on the cash commitment, or 10.49% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $130.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $134.91/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.33% if the stock gets called away at the June 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.45% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 29%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 28%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $134.91) to be 28%.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the ProShares ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (Symbol: TQQQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $70.44 per unit.


With TQQQ trading at a recent price near $64.16 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.79% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of TQQQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), and Automatic Data Processing Inc. (Symbol: ADP). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $23.93/share, the average analyst target is 20.70% higher at $28.88/share. Similarly, SNPS has 11.68% upside from the recent share price of $132.12 if the average analyst target price of $147.56/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADP to reach a target price of $176.17/share, which is 10.46% above the recent price of $159.49. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, SNPS, and ADP:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

The average rating presented in the last row of the table above is from 1 to 5, where 1 would be a consensus Strong Buy and 5 would be a consensus Strong Sell.  In the middle, 3 would be a Hold.  So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment.  The average rating of 1.38 for SNPS leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the SNPS price target paints a different picture.  Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Synopsys Inc.  Of course, the average price target is just that — a mathematical average, and is only one metric.  There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $160.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $119.00.  The standard deviation is $15.526.


But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes — much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close.  And so with SNPS trading so far above that average target price of $142.25/share, the -2.24% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings.  Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming?  Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation?  One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good ""signal"" to investors in SNPS to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Synopsys Inc.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Synopsys  for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, Anna. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release.In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release and financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that Synopsys continues to execute very well and delivered excellent Q3 results. Revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow were all ahead of plan. As a result of Q3 overachievement and broad-based strength, we're raising guidance for the fiscal year. These achievements reflect our increased momentum, evident in visibly strong results and outlook, product differentiation and technical strength, and demand for advanced solutions throughout our business. We're progressing rapidly on our journey toward 4 billion [Phonetic] and beyond, while increasing value with operating margin expansion already visible in our bottom line results.Before I discuss the broader landscape, let me say a few words about the US-China situation. The government's entities ban has affected our revenue somewhat. However, even assuming the ban remains in place for the rest of the fiscal year, we're raising our targets. Given the sensitivity for our customers, we will refrain from making any further comments. We're confident in our outlook, despite the geopolitical and economic backdrop as global design activity and customer engagements are thriving. AI, automotive, 5G, IoT, cloud and the proliferation of Smart Everything are not only growing segments, but also very competitive thus requiring the advanced solutions that Synopsys has to offer.After five years of substantial investments, our product platforms are the strongest they've ever been, putting us in an ideal position to benefit from the dynamic market trends. Notably, our new EDA products are winning share with competitive displacements at leading systems and semiconductor companies. We also had a record quarter with our broad portfolio of IP building blocks. Our IP offering is highly differentiated in driving time-to-market advantages for customers ranging from the largest market making companies to fast growing AI start-ups.While investing heavily in both EDA and IP, we've also diversified our business and customer base into the high-growth Software Security TAM. Our products and services are increasingly mission critical for the massive amounts of software that permeates our everyday lives. Our software integrity business is now at 10% of overall Synopsys revenue, is profitable and continues to scale well. We've accomplished all of this, while meeting our financial objectives and raising our near-term and long-term financial ambitions.Building on our track record and the stability of our recurring revenue model, we're delivering significant margin expansion and solid double-digit earnings growth. From the perspective of our product platforms, let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. As a result of our intense multi-year innovation push in digital design, including new game-changing products and major updates, our technology is winning benchmarks and driving increased competitive displacements, especially at advanced nodes. This is evident in our results, as revenue growth for digital has accelerated.In particular, Fusion Compiler continues the strong momentum that began with its launch in November. It has won all head-to-head benchmarks completed to date with consistently better quality of results and run-time across multiple applications. We have mobile, 5G, high performance computing, data servers, automotive, AI, networking or graphics. We have several breakthrough competitive wins at noteworthy large semiconductor companies, including a significant competitive adoption at a leading US-based mobile 5G company.We also won a decisive benchmark at the very large -- at a very large Taiwanese semiconductor company and achieve the win for 5-nanometer ARM-based hyper-computing designs, at a new well-funded European customer. Also in Q3, the internal IP core group of an international mobile company, standardized on Fusion Compiler for all CPU and GPU designs at current and upcoming advanced nodes. A US large cap systems company has selected Fusion Compiler, as its primary platform for digital implementation. Finally, a premier US semiconductor company is aggressively expanding deployment of Fusion Compiler for its mission-critical programs, representing more than 95% of its business.Turning to custom design. Synopsys is gaining share, bolstered by 30%-plus revenue growth for Custom Compiler over the last four quarters. Our expansion is fueled by key wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets, including a Tier 1 North American server company. We have also begun multiple full flow competitive displacements, including our traditional analog customers. And during the quarter, we won yet another major contract at the large US high-speed communication chip maker. These wins are a result of powerful innovations that are driving 3 times to 5 times productivity benefits, especially for advanced node design and a unique technical advantage by partnering with our world-class mixed-signal IP team.Moving now to our Verification Continuum platform, where our early vision and technology strength have led to our Number 1 market segment position. Verification software growth is strong, reflecting the impact of tight integration of the fastest simulation with static and debug engines on the market. Contributing substantially to this growth, our large influential cloud hyperscalers in North America, notable evidence of the power of our solution. Hardware verification is strong as well. For the third year in a row, we stand as the Number 1 provider in hardware verification overall, as well as in the emulation and FPGA-based prototyping subcategories.By delivering the fastest, highest capacity and lowest cost of ownership solutions, we are the preferred choice for complex hardware, software designs. Hardware-based systems have broad-based appeal. From large processor companies to market leading system houses to emerging companies optimizing their software on hardware that is still in development. In addition to high secular market demand, we are winning important design slots and customer adoptions continue to grow substantially.In the first three quarters of this year alone, we added 32 new customers and had 74 repeat orders. The significant broad-based growth has offset a year-over-year decline in hardware revenue from our largest emulation customer, driven by the timing of product shipments. We expect the total hardware revenue this fiscal year will match or even exceed the banner results from last year.Now to IP, where strong market demand and our unmatched portfolio are driving double-digit growth. Q3 was a record quarter, including the largest single IP order in our history with a prominent US semiconductor company. We expect to deliver a record year as well. We see especially strong momentum in interface IP, where we are 45 times larger than our nearest competitor, along with memory and logic IP, where we also lead the market. We're proud of our loan positive track record of providing early availability of high quality IP at the key manufacturing processes. This commitment to vital technologies has driven our ongoing success from one IP generation to the next. As an example, our USB titles alone passed$1 billion in cumulative bookings this quarter.Cloud computing, particularly AI accelerators and hyperscale data centers, is driving substantial growth. Market makers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific are adopting IP across our portfolio at a rapid pace. Also, strong our processors, particularly machine learning and AI engines for embedded vision, driven by top semi and systems companies. After significant investments to enhance our portfolio for automotive reliability and safety standards, we achieved another important milestone with ISO 9001 certification of our IP quality management system setting the foundation for further growth.Finally, we saw continued strong momentum in mobile with multi-million dollar agreements at multiple global leaders, which brings me to Software Integrity where the combination of rapidly growing market needs and our wide-ranging and evolving portfolio are driving approximately 20% growth this year. We not only offer the broadest portfolio of tools and services, we're moving to the next level of impact and ease of adoption with our new Polaris Software Integrity Platform. Announced in Q2, it's a cloud-based platform with a compelling integration roadmap for continual roll-outs over the next 18 months. Polaris is drawing positive and growing interest from a wide range of customers.Building on the first adoption by a Fortune 500 insurance company in May, we received several new orders in Q3 from customers ranging from financial services to networking to a highly recognized beverage company. The acquisitions and integration of Black Duck and Cigital have been essential in building the leadership position we have today as recognized by Gartner and Forrester. Addressing fundamental code quality and security, analyzing and flagging suspect open source code, and engaging with enterprise customers both technology up and management down are enabling high level strategic relationships. Renewal rates are up and we continue to see longer duration multi-million dollar agreements. Building off the current base of more than $300 million in revenue and increasing profitability, we're enthusiastic about the long-term potential of this business.In summary, strong execution delivered excellent Q3 results, and we're raising our annual revenue, non-GAAP earnings, and cash flow guidance. Design activity continues unabated. Our product platforms are the strongest they've ever been. And they are driving technology wins and competitive displacements. Finally, a sincere thank you to our employees for their continued commitment to our customers and to the long-term success of our Company.With that, I'll turn it over to Trac. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we executed another strong quarter, delivering record results for revenue, non-GAAP earnings, and operating cash flow. We also implemented a $100 million buyback bringing our total repurchases for the year to $229 million. Further, we continue to expand operating margins and expect to deliver nearly 300 basis points of expansion for the year, reaching approximately 25% non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of guidance. We are on track for another outstanding year, reflecting the strength of the first three quarters and a robust outlook that I will provide shortly.First, I'll review our Q3 results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated consolidated total revenue of $853 million or 9% growth with a broad-based strength across both our segments. Semiconductor & System Design revenue was $769 million, while Software Integrity revenue was $84 million. This quarter, our Semiconductor & System Design segment was bolstered by strong customer demand and the timing of customer pull downs of our IP products. EDA software continues to perform very well within the Semiconductor & System Design segment, although EDA hardware revenue declined year-over-year against a strong Q3 in 2018. Despite quarterly hardware variability, we do expect our total hardware business for the year to meet or exceed last year's record results.Consolidated total GAAP costs and expenses were $725 million, which includes approximately $19 million in restructuring costs as we work to optimize our resource allocation for sustainable long-term growth. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $636 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25.4%. At the segment level, adjusted operating margins were 27.1% for Semiconductor & System Design and 10.5% for Software Integrity. Note that certain operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and other expenses that are managed at the consolidated level, have not been allocated to our segments.GAAP earnings per share were $0.65 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.18. Turning to cash. Operating cash flow was $370 million, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $687 million and total debt of $142 million.Now to our targets, which excludes any revenue in Q4 from Company's currently on the government's Entity List. For fiscal 2019, revenue of $3.34 billion to $3.37 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.82 billion and $2.852 billion, total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $2.512 billion and $2.532 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of approximately 25%.Other income and expenses between minus $4 million and minus $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; operating margins -- outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings $3.11 per share to $3.24 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $4.52 per share to $4.57 per share; cash flow from operations of approximately $750 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $230 million as $40 million of spending was shifted to fiscal 2020 due to project timing.Now to the targets for the fourth quarter. Revenue between $830 million and $860 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $701 million and $733 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $630 million and $650 million; other income and expenses between minus $2 million and zero; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.69 per share to $0.82 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.10 per share to $1.15 per share.To conclude, our execution through three quarters demonstrates our ability to pursue growth in a variety of macroeconomic conditions, while maintaining focus on our longer-term operating objectives. We continue to execute very well both financially and operationally. We are significantly exceeding our beginning of the year objectives with high-single digit revenue growth, substantial operating margin expansion, and solid double-digit EPS growth. And we continue to return a large portion of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of buybacks. With the power of our portfolio and business model, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value.And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Maybe just to start off, your tone on the digital side was perhaps surprisingly positive. You mentioned that you've basically, one, I guess all of your head-to-head benchmarks, which is pretty significant. So, just wanted to sort of get a -- your sort of state of the market there in digital and your thoughts on how that's going to play out over the next year or two? I think you sort of admittedly came from a position of perhaps being behind and obviously invested a lot here. So just wanted to sort of get your updated thoughts on the digital marketplace. -- Well, you know, we've had the lead position actually for multiple decades. And at any point in time, one has to look at when to make big investments. And over the last few years, we made some very big investments, because we have come to the clear -- come to the clear conclusion that individual products would gradually start to -- not get as good results, instead of bringing them together. And so, Fusion Compiler is the prime example for that where the intersection of synthesis with place and route and a few other capabilities, is now generating really good results.And of course, you have high hopes for such a thing, but it's until you have actually real results that customers pay attention. And even then, they go through benchmark and then to trying a few blocks and then to gradually institutionalize plan of record utilization over much broader set of chips. And so, we introduced Fusion Compiler, I believe last November or so. And so far, the results are truly stellar and we're making very rapid advances. So that doesn't mean there is not a lot of work to be done, but it also means that I think we have still better results to deliver, because this is the new platform for us. -- Got it. And then just on Software Integrity, it sounds like you're seeing what you'd hope to see with Polaris, which is more sort of larger and longer duration deals, but it does look like the growth may have slipped a little bit in the third quarter. I'm assuming that's just sort of lumpiness in that you still see this as a 20% growth business sort of medium-term here? -- Yeah, that's the way we're looking at it. Of course from quarter-to-quarter, it can vary. It is useful that you highlighted Polaris though, because I'm a strong believer that, right now there are so many companies all dealing with sort of snippets of security all over the place. And for all the large companies at some point in time, they want to have some more stability in how the Head of IT or the CSO or anybody else who's in charge of all the software in a Company to have an ability to not only bottom up, bring productivity because you can destroy productivity of here you're not going after security particularly well. But just as much bring some degree of controllership, top down as to what portions of the code have actually been verified. And so, it's in that context that while the development of Polaris is a multi-year effort and we will gradually bring in more-and-more of our products, the division is clearly viewed positively and the first implementation with the Coverity tools is actually doing well. -- Got it. Thank you very much, Aart. -- Thank you, Rich.Our next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, good afternoon. I was hoping to get a little bit of clarity on how you see customers during times that the business slows down a little bit. What is the normal course of action when it comes to them, trimming the number of current projects they work on? How long does that take to impact you and is that been completely offset by just the complexity of designs today? -- Okay. This is a multifaceted question, but generically speaking, in the semiconductor industry, the variability as a function of up and down revenue is highest for people that supply everything that has to do with volume, so equipment, for example and is actually lowest for people that have to deal with R&D, because all the R&D plans are multi-year plans and just because a year is particularly strong or weak, doesn't really changed all that much. The first one to say. Rich customers are better than poor customers, but nonetheless the fact remains that we are in a segment and Synopsys particularly has benefited from that, of bringing stability in times of questions and the ability to really scale rapidly, when things go well.Now simultaneously, I think you asked also a question on the growth of complexity. And there -- in many ways, the good old Moore's Law, more transistors, we sort of know how to do that. And not that it's ever gets easier, but it's never gotten easier and we've always managed just fine. I think the interesting new problems that is at the intersection of semiconductors and systems, specifically when you also connected to software. And we are investing substantially in that. To be honest, I forget if I mentioned the automotive effort, where we're doing very well. And that's a perfect example of people wanting to test the automotive software before the electronics are done. So systemic complexity is as much of an opportunity for us as anything. -- Okay. So you don't see kind of major material impact to R&D budgets, when customers go through a tough period like what they see right now in the semiconductor world? -- Well, everybody when they go through a tough time, they do look at their budgets and they reorient toward what will have the most impact. But it's actually fairly rare that people would cut R&D people. And so, it's more that they reprioritize those things that have the biggest potential as a downturn fades away to come back up. The other maybe comment to make is that, this is also a good time where people relook at the IP. Because a lot of companies do their own IP still and they discover that we can provide a large number of extremely sophisticated blocks and that accelerates their ability to go to market, while not having to use their most valuable engineers on these difficult blocks. So downturns actually have interesting enough opportunity for us, because fundamentally we are a productivity enabling company and that's what they need. -- Okay. Well, thanks a lot. That clearly helps. -- You're welcome. Thank you, Tom.Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I got two. The first one, I'm going to start out kind of the tougher one given the accounting changes, but when you look at the core EDA business, that's actually down year-over-year for a couple of quarters now. Could you maybe help us, one, understand the accounting behind it? And then secondly, how we get comfortable around high-single digit growth considering it's been down for a couple of quarters now? -- Yeah. Let me start with answer your question directly, the -- when you look at the profile for EDA, what you're seeing this year is just a variability in emulation hardware. Keep in mind that the hardware piece shows up in two places emulation is in EDA and then HAPs the FPGA prototyping should show up in IP and systems integration. And so, you're seeing variability in that number. If you were to adjust for the hardware piece that's showing up in EDA and keep in mind that last year was a record year for emulation, you should see a very good mid-to-high single-digit growth in that area. And that's very much in line with the -- the EDA software is growing in that range, very much in line with what we've previously communicated. -- Okay, perfect. And then, the second one I had is just more of a technical one, so it is more for Aart, a matter of hard chips, we came out with some other interesting designs, including these large plotters of 1.2 trillion transistors and they kind of made their own tools or EDA tools. So I guess, maybe you can comment on that, if that's a viable model in the future. And then, maybe how Synopsys would fit into potentially designing, something like that in the future? -- Well, we happen to know them very well. And so, I'll be careful what we comment. You may know that, I think it's already in the '80s that there was sort of an effort to see could one make essentially chips that would cover a whole wafer and connect them creatively. And at that time, the yields were just too questionable to be able to do that effectively. Depending on what node you pick now, the yields can be actually very, very good. And so, the fact that they are attempting to put such an astronomical number of transistors on a wafer is to say the least, one for the Guinness books of records. But it will be interesting to see how well this fines utilization by the customer. And I have not yet seen any of the results that you can get in terms of using this on AI machine learning problems, but that's clearly what they are going after.And generically speaking, I think there is no doubt whatsoever that in the next multiple decades, the hunger for more machine learning computation will be unstoppable. The challenge is going to be, so how do you actually do it in practice, how do you do it at manageable levels of power, how do you connect all of those things. And there is a plethora of efforts with different packaging forms and the whole wafer approach, I think at least the pictures, I would say were pretty cool. I must say that. -- Perfect. Thank you.Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. I'm wondering if you could just go and give us a little bit more color on -- you mentioned the strength in IP was from the timing of IP draw-down. Any additional color as to the areas and if we should think that strengthen in draw-down will continue into the fourth quarter? -- Well, I think in general, what we've seen over multiple years is that the reason IP is growing is not only because reuse of IP is completely acceptable. So there is no longer any sort of form of macho [Phonetic] has got to do my own IP. There is a use your best people to solve problems that you can solve by acquisition as long as the price is right, of course. And so, that has continued from a different -- two different dimensions. One is that many of these IP blocks themselves have grown in complexity dramatically. And so, the USB family that I mentioned went through different versions. And the first one is look pretty simple, but the last ones are most definitely not simple.And then on top of that, these different generations of computation in these blocks are implemented in the most advanced silicon technology, and so you get sort of a multiplicative effect of difficulty. And this is precisely why I think this is a very strong business for Synopsys because we've gone through pretty much every challenge and difficulty in getting these things to work, and far for me to say that it's perfect, but we have a trust relationship with the customer. We're at the end of the day we make things work and I think we are a great provider to continue to see that.Maybe one more comment. Large companies have used IP often on and are now starting to grow their IP utilization. And actually it ties directly to the previous question of how could you increase productivity in market times that may be more challenging. But the other observation is that new start-up companies, they never think twice about it. It's immediately, what can I put on the shopping list and now I have to do all the rest, and certainly all the AI start-ups fall in that category. So I do think that we have a very good run path or road map for this, not that these IP blocks will ever be simple, but I think the very fact that they are complex is good for us. -- Sounds good. And then one just follow up Trac for you. Looking at the build out to cash flow in the quarter, it looks like deferred revenue was actually cash outflow for the second straight quarter. Anything that we should think about either in terms of timing of renewals or anything else that would have contributed to that? -- I wouldn't look at the deferred as an issue. When I look at the business for Q3 and the quality of our bookings run rate was up healthily, and we'll -- we're going to show this in our Q next week when we reported that backlog was actually steady from quarter to quarter. So from that perspective, the business is growing very nicely. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi, everyone. I want to start with a question about the repeatability of the IP strength. And you mentioned a large -- largest order in the Company's history. I presume this was some sort of multi -- tens of million dollar platform license agreement with the key US customer. I think you specifically cited. So I'm just curious if there's going to be more of these types of license agreements, and then related to the increase in IP revenue, specifically, the mix was up rather substantially in spite of that. You showed a sequential improvement in the operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design business. So, I'm wondering what's the -- what was the catalyst there. -- Well, in general, we do think that the IP business will continue to grow. You don't get every day very, very large deals, but our transactions -- but in general, yes it is multi-year and it's also broadening in terms of the offering that we will make available to customers. And you'll think about it a little bit as they go to a restaurant and they can sort of pick from the menu, but it's prepaid. And that makes everything simpler over multiple years. Now having said that, the investments will continue quite heavily in this area, because the evolution is so rapid and that also means that we have to be well aligned with the semiconductor foundries that provides the silicon technology so that things are ready on time. I thought there was second half of the question, I forgot what that was. -- There was a question on margin. -- Yeah, margin. -- Let me address the margin fees. Overall, when you look at the margin profile for the business, we've been running pretty steadily at 25% for the year. And when you look at the midpoint for the year, we're on track to hit that number for FY '19. So there is a pretty strong increase in margins from last year to this year. So, what you're seeing is less a mix as opposed to a deliberate and concerted effort to increase the operations. -- Okay. Part of the operating margin question, one thing that is glaring is no mention of the goal to achieve high 20% operating margin for fiscal year '20. So I'm wondering if that was a conscious omission or are you guys still committed to that? -- Yes. when we talk -- when we last talked to investors in April, we talked about driving margins to the high-20s by FY '21 and the 30% over the longer term. We remain committed to that. There is no mention specifically about FY '20 because we will come back to you in December and give that more specific guidance, but there is no change to our margin outlook. -- Okay. Last question if I can. Your cash flow from operations and maybe not so much the free cash flow this year, but you're definitely generating more cash flow than you're buying back in stock, almost glaring amount in, and so your debt presumably be paid off in four or five months time and with maybe a slower pace of acquisitions. Should we think about your capital allocation is increasingly being skewed to stock buyback? -- I think we've done a pretty good job balancing the use of cash over the last few years between M&A, organic investments, and buybacks. Our history is showing that we're pretty diligent about returning a substantial amount of free cash flow to -- via buybacks. We haven't changed our approach to that. From quarter to quarter, it may vary depending on the situation, but our overarching approach to capital allocation and capital returns remains the same. -- Okay. Congrats on the results. Thanks guys. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good evening. Trac, first for you. Just to clarify the answer you gave to Sterling earlier, you're saying that your backlog as of the end of Q3 was again $4.3 billion. -- That's correct. -- Okay. Aart and Trac, you mentioned, I believe that you're anticipating that the hardware business for the year will match what you did in fiscal '18. Given the magnitude of the declines in hardware year-to-date by the emulation and prototyping, would it be fair to say that you are in effect anticipating in fourth quarter a record for hardware revenues that would impact substantially beyond the prior record set back in Q2 of fiscal '18? -- Actually Jay, that's not the case. The hardware's actually been fairly steady throughout the year. The mix routine emulation and the FPGA prototyping is different than it was last year, but it -- we're not anticipating a steep ramp-up in Q4. -- Okay. A related question on hardware. One of the things that we've observed for all of the Big 3, for you, Mentor and Cadence is longevity of demand for aging systems, hardware version that have been in market for some time. Cadence has seen this. Mentor has had some quite strong quarters over the last couple of years, even though [Indecipherable] has been now or the current version of [Indecipherable] has been out for some time.So my question is, what is it that induces customers to order or reorder somewhat older hardware technology? And when you look at the possible refresh of your hardware earlier today, Xilinx announced a very large FPGA, which would seem to be the kind of chip that you would want to incorporate in the next generation chassis for both ZeBu and HAPS, but it's not coming out to fall of next year. So, assuming you want to incorporate that particular chip into your next-generation of hardware, how do you sustain the demand for hardware over the next year or so? -- Well, starting at the beginning of your question. One of the reasons, at least for us, and I think we are a little different than our competitors, because we are focusing really very hard at the intersection between hardware and software. We think that's where the biggest opportunity space is not that our machines cannot also be used who just simulation acceleration. And so, that space on its own in my opinion is going to continue to grow because more and more people want to run software on systems, where the time to build the systems is long and the risks if they don't check it out early is that they will miss the windows on the markets. So therefore the software and the hardware have to be developed in parallel. And so, we support that I think extremely well and literally from day-to-day better. And again, maybe the most visible simple example is automotive. We're putting a car together, it takes five to seven years. And so, if you start your software in the last hour, this thing will never go to market.The second comment is now specifically on our technology, we are FPGA based, and so we have the benefit of being able to move forward with the different generations of FPGAs. We have excellent relationships with the people that provide those. And so, we are at any point in time, well clued in as to what will matter and what will not and our development just continues.Lastly, you said that old systems, they can hang around for a long time. Yes, they do. And I think nothing wrong with that. It's great to return on investment for our customers. But I'd say that new systems are substantially faster and have more capacity and that is precisely what Synopsys has driven up for a number of years in unexpectedly successful ways. -- Lastly, with respect to services. You may recall, I think with one or two calls ago, we talked about the role of services, particularly in the context of SIG and the introduction of Polaris. My question is, can you comment on how your services engagement pipeline looks, not only for SIG, but perhaps for IP as well, particularly given the magnitude of demand you're seeing now for IP? How are you looking at your services engagement pipeline, not only for that, but again for SIG? -- Well, for SIG, there is no question in our mind that the acquisition of Cigital, but most importantly, the integration of Cigital with the product lines of Coverity and Black Duck and a few others. We have been absolutely essential, because the SIG team is extremely capable of engaging with high-level people and companies that are looking at how do they start getting a handle on security as software is being developed and that is precisely where we're focusing. And so, I think that integration has gone in many ways better than we would have hoped, and is now in full utilization to continue to sell other products.It's interesting that you use the term services and IP and I think it's probably right on. Because IP is something between products and services, a number of the IP cores get optimized for specific customers or specific technologies. And increasingly, we are assembling subsystems under directive or together with the customer to drive their capabilities forward. And so, while we don't really call out a particular service business, these multi-year IP transactions invariably have all kinds of development plans associated with them. -- Thank you very much. -- You're welcome, Jay.Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Good afternoon guys. Thanks. If I may [Phonetic] ask the question. I'm just kind of curious just given how critical your IP and products are in the semiconductor supply chain and just given how visible Huawei has become and so what could happen, what's the risk that other Chinese chip makers are kind of buying ahead or accelerating their plans just out of fear. Do you see any evidence of that? If that were happening, what evidence would you see? And then, I have a follow-up. -- Well, I think it's a little hard to predict what's going to happen in that situation. As we said earlier in the preamble, we're sort of cautious to not make too many comments about China as a number of our customers really need to certain degree of -- let's say, privacy on their situation. In general, not just China, any place in the world will be happy to sell their things that people want for a longer duration. And as such, most of the larger IP transactions are multi-years, because the delivery of these large blocks themselves take some time. And secondly, the integration of those blocks into very sophisticated chips need support. And so, multiyear transactions are absolutely the norm. -- And then Aart, there was no other conversation about sort of base level of chips. I'm kind of curious when you think about the disaggregation of data [Phonetic] that are going on with the chip strategy, with some of the packaging technologies. And we even talked this week about building of stacks on the chips where you have both memory and logic, how does that benefit your business over time? -- Yeah, we are sort of in the category more [Indecipherable], right, meaning that we are believers that the demand for electronic capabilities is unsatiable. But the technology limits are very real. And so, while conceptually it sounds relatively straightforward, why don't you just stack them up on top of each other like a high-rise, we often forget that there is a big difference between the memory and let's say processor, because the memory is already a stack device today, whereas the processor is also a massive heat source. And so, when you stack things and there is also a lot of heat and you need certainly becomes complicated.Now out of that nonetheless, there are a lot of efforts to look at different forms of packaging and we've seen this before by the way and we've seen that in the early 2000s when the world was, hey, we're never going to go to smaller transistors. And then, out of nowhere came 15 years of FinFET and that's only the interest for stocking with a little lessons. But I think it's going to come back and we are very involved in that. But it is truly set of decision making that has both technology and economic constraints. And I do have high hopes that because of the demand that will over time actually pay for some of these more expensive approaches. That's why we're all in on this. -- And then my last question, guys, just kind of the Software Integrity business and the op margins. Still a small part of the business, but it's still about 200-plus basis point drag on the overall op margins. That makes sense given you guys are driving scale and revenue growth. I'm kind of curious what is the scale volume level on the Software Integrity business when you start to get [Indecipherable], so the overall company part of that or is that separate? -- John, the way I think about it is it over the next couple of years as we drive margins to the high-20s by FY '21, I would expect that Software Integrity would be approaching closer to the corporate average. That structurally there is nothing in that business that would prevent it from reaching that kind of margins with scale. But the key for us as we evaluate that business, it's still a very nascent opportunity -- dynamic opportunity with a lot of competitive environment. So we want to make sure that we're making the right trade-offs between growth and profitability. -- Perfect. Thanks guys. -- You're welcome.Our next question is from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Please go ahead. -- Hi guys. This is Joshua talking on for Gal. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on digital. You mentioned competitive displacements. Is Fusion the key driver of that? And then, are you starting to see signs of Fusion Tech making customers stickier due to its forward and backward looking capabilities? -- Well, I'm using Fusion as the best example, because it's the most powerful conjunction of multiple technologies working extremely well together. Synthesis creates the structure of a circuit, determines the actual location of everything. And those are the fundamental problems, but there are more technologies in that and surrounded by it. And so for example, you also want to optimize for timing for the lower power maybe for some degree of yield and so on. And so, you can already see from that discussion that you have multiple forces interacting. And I think the strength of the approach that we have taken is that we have created an environment that allows us to bring all of these forces to bear at the same time. And what is exciting is that we are now winning hard benchmarks on the basis of putting this to use. What is also exciting is that I think it's still has a long way to go in terms of further advances, but our customers are pretty pragmatic. They've worked very hard to optimize circuits even a little bit. And so, if you can get truly better results and you can get there much sooner, they will move pretty quickly. -- Thank you. That was helpful. And then just a follow-up real quick on China. Is it a fair assumption that the 60-40 split between semi and systems companies hold in that region as well? It just seems like a lot of the focus is on Huawei and we don't hear much about Baidu and Tencent chip initiatives. -- The split of 60-40, yeah, it's nothing new. We have had that in the late '90s and it's all a question of what do you call a systems company and what do you call a semi company. Typically, semi is when you stop at the chip, you finished the chip, and then you sell it to somebody else. A system company tends to move from there and add to the chip, the software, the package whatever all other electromechanical things, and now -- so a phone company -- a phone -- a mobile phone provider, would be a system company. And so the -- it's sort of a continuum between those. And what is interesting from our perspective is that while many years ago, we clearly started in a very chip-centric fashion. The importance of software was recognized by Synopsys already about 10 years ago, and we started at that time to invest in the verification and prototyping to verify things together, but we, by the way, also about 5.5 years ago, invested in software, because we realize that software could become the killer in terms of getting to market with something that actually works. -- Hi, John, this is Trac again. I just want to clarify my remarks earlier. I may have left to you with the impression that Software Integrity was going to hit the corporate average by FY '21, it certainly can -- it certainly will progress to that, but not necessarily be at the same corporate average in the high-20s.And our last question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- Hey guys, thanks for fitting me in. One question around your QTronic acquisition. I just want to clarify that, that's not in guidance, and can you maybe provide some color on how that fits in with the rest of your portfolio? And then I have one follow-up. -- Sure. Yeah. That's an acquisition that's not closed yet, and therefore we would not put it in guidance, but it's also not material in terms of size. But it is an exciting acquisition, because it fits right into the center of the picture that I just painted of automotive companies looking at the software and the hardware simultaneously. And this company, in particular, has a very good technology and experts in looking at how you test situations like that for the aficionados in the room, it's called software in the loop, but that's probably going too deep on this topic. -- And, I mean, can you -- how many employees would that be adding? -- About 60 or so. -- Okay, great. And one quick follow-up for Trac. The SIG margins were 10.5%, up 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter, which is pretty good. But from a seasonality perspective, is there anything about Q4 from an investment or spend perspective that would be different than any of the previous quarters than we've seen? -- No, I don't see -- I don't see seasonality affecting that number at all. I think, while we've reached critical mass with that business being about 10% of overall revenues is still fairly small. So from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the profile of revenues or expenses, you're going to see that bounce around. But the good news is that over the course of multiple years, it's heading in the right direction. -- Great, thanks. That's all for me. -- Welcome. -- Okay. I guess that brings us to the end of this earnings release. Thank you so much for spending time with us. Hopefully, you took away that we sense a quite a good degree of momentum and push forward and that notwithstanding some of the turbulences around us, Synopsys is actually doing both very well, I think, very stable in this context. So, thank you for your support and questions.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

The average rating presented in the last row of the table above is from 1 to 5, where 1 would be a consensus Strong Buy and 5 would be a consensus Strong Sell.  In the middle, 3 would be a Hold.  So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment.  The average rating of 1.38 for SNPS leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the SNPS price target paints a different picture.  Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at Synopsys Inc.  Of course, the average price target is just that — a mathematical average, and is only one metric.  There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $152.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $117.00.  The standard deviation is $14.166.


But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes — much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close.  And so with SNPS trading so far above that average target price of $129.88/share, the -3.79% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings.  Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming?  Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation?  One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good ""signal"" to investors in SNPS to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for Synopsys Inc.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

 , which makes specialty software used in the semiconductor industry, reported its fiscal year 2019 second-quarter results on Wednesday.Sales continued to grow at a moderate pace and management was also able to boost margins modestly and buy back some stock. The combination helped drive a double-digit jump on the bottom line. The upbeat results also enabled the company to favorably tweak its guidance for the full year. That's pretty impressive given that the Trump administration recently decided to place Chinese tech giant Huawei -- one of Synopsys' customers -- on a list of companies that  without the government's approval.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Synopsys  for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, Anna. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, 8-K and financial supplement that we released earlier today.Also included in the financial supplement is detailed information around our long-term financial objectives, the transition to ASC 606 this year and operating segment results. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.With that, I will turn this over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I'm happy to report excellent second quarter results. Revenue was a record $836 million with strength across both operating segments. In Semiconductor & System Design, software revenue growth was particularly strong, moderated somewhat by a tough hardware comparison versus a record second quarter 2018. Software Integrity revenue tracked right to plan, with greater than 20% growth and is expected to be profitable for the year.Non-GAAP EPS was $1.16 and we repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing the total to far this year to $129 million. While the US export restrictions that were announced last week do have an impact, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings guidance and the top end of our revenue range to reflect the strength of our business. Trac will provide some additional color on this topic and discuss the financials in more detail.While geopolitical tension has escalated, the overall customer environment for us is quite solid. The hunger for advanced technology, designed tools, IP and security solutions is strong, creating a robust market opportunity. The growing impact of AI, 5G, Internet of Things and Big Data is profound and is driving substantial investment in new compute and machine learning architecture. Virtually all vertical markets are engaging with AI and the potential economic impact is forecast to be in the trillions of dollars. In addition to long time in semiconductor vendors, very large system companies and cloud providers are investing competitively, opening further opportunities for us.The push for AI solutions, along with the growing security issues associated with the highly interconnected world benefits our entire Silicon to Software product portfolio. Synopsys is ideally positioned to solve these very complex challenges. Our EDA design and verification solutions are front and center in creating brand new AI optimized engines. Our IP is broadly used in the most advanced silicon technologies ever built. Our prototyping tools run and test software on new subsystems long before silicon is available and our software security and quality solutions are essential to minimize vulnerability to threats.In that context, let me provide some highlights from the quarter beginning with EDA. The underlying driver of EDA growth in design complexity along three vectors, one, advanced processes moving to smaller density technology nodes, such as 7, 5 and more recently 3 nanometer. Two, optimizing designs in more established nodes for cost reduction but also speed and low power. And three, massive software content that is becoming integrated as part of chip design. And overall, the system challenges to make sure the chip and the software work well together.In design, customers rely on Synopsys for virtually all of their 12-nanometer and below designs. The key reasons, our state-of-the-art tools and also our unmatched collaboration and support. This quarter we continued our long-standing foundry-enablement with TSMC who certified both our digital and custom design platforms for its 5-nanometer FinFET process. TSMC also certified our Fusion Design Platform for their innovative System-on-Integrated-Chip or SoIC chip stacking technology, delivering design solutions for through 3D design device integrations.Samsung used our complete design solution to develop the very first test chip for its brand new gate-all-around process. In digital design, a rapidly growing highlight is the success of our new Fusion Compiler product, which we launched in November. It's revolutionary combination of the main pillars of design, all of which are cornerstones for Synopsys; it synthesis, place-and-route and signoff into a single solution on a single data model. Fusion Compiler is doing really well from both technical and business perspectives. A rapidly growing set of customers is reporting excellent results, including significantly shorter design times, a higher level of predictability and better timing area and power results.Adopted by 19 different logos across eight different processes node and used for about 250 active and by now completed design, the trajectory is impressive. One such customer is Renesas how deployed Fusion Compiler across its high-value automotive portfolio. Renesas cited consistently superior power, performance and full-flow productivity on its production design. The versatility and potential of the Fusion Design Platform is living up to its promise, which includes continuously adding of new Fusion technology capabilities to broaden its impact.This quarter, for example, we launched a fully integrated test flow containing next-generation capabilities for automotive tests and functional safety. Stay tuned as we deliver further enhancements over the next 12 months.Now turning to verification where we continue to see outstanding results and a strong outlook for the year. Thanks to many years of great technology advances and excellent customer support. We are the market leader. Verification is a huge bottleneck for chip and system design. Customers tell us that they can't get enough verification as design complexity is getting more difficult and more time consuming by the day. Synopsys is fortunate to have the fastest software and hardware solutions and demand is high for our Verification Continuum platform.Q2 strength in verification software was driven in part by accelerating demand from influential systems companies who are reinventing how to design and verify their next-generation products. Our decade long leadership is an important indicator of our impact. 12 of the top 15 semiconductor companies in the world use our franchise VCS simulator as their primary verification solution. Demand for our hardware-based verification is also high and increasingly broad base. The ability to validate chips together with the software and the need for early software developments are paramount.Our new ZeBu 4 emulator launched late last year is doing very well with early demand exceeding expectations and outpacing that of previous solutions. Adoption of our HAPS) FPGA-based prototyping solutions, which targets early software development was again robust in the quarter. As a result of our differentiation, we are the market leader in both emulation and prototyping.Now to IP, which had another very strong quarter and is poised for an excellent year of double-digit growth. As the Number 2 vendor in the world and the market leader in interface, analog, embedded memory and foundry-specific IP, we provide the industry's broadest set of building blocks to address today's most complex design requirements for AI, automotive, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and more.The quarter featured a number of important milestones at advanced nodes. We announced that we have achieved more than 250 IP wins on TSMC's 7-nanometer FinFET process across a broad range of applications. In addition, we signed a multi-year agreement with a marquee global customer for 5-nanometer IP. Meanwhile, our portfolio continues to expand. Further building on our strength in automotive, we announced a collaboration with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to develop the industry's first automotive grade IP for their 22 nanometer FDX process. We announced a complete solution for one of the hottest markets around narrowband IoT, enabling the next wave of connected devices and we taped (ph) out two key IT titles for cloud computing and AI applications, including a 112 gig SerDes, an ultra high-speed connection for hyperscale data centers.With the rising complexity and time to market challenges inherent in delivering today's electronic systems, Synopsys sells a critical and growing need for sophisticated low risk IP, which brings me to our Software Integrity group, which has now reached a 10% of Synopsys revenue milestone and is scaling nicely. As software security issues continue to increase in both number and severity, testing during the development process becomes a necessity. This is true not only for electronics, but for anyone who develops software in financial services, medical, automotive, industrial and beyond. The progress our team has made in building this business over the past five years is striking.While we acquired compelling technologies and added substantial organic investment, we also focused our deep knowledge toward building a compelling software security and quality platform. In March we announced our new Polaris software integrity platform. It brings products and services together into an integrated user friendly, cloud based solutions that make deployment and scalability easier. While we will continue to deliver enhancements to the platform over the next 12 to 18 months, the initial release is already showing great promise.We are engaged with customers across all regions and early reaction has been very positive. This included a Fortune 500 insurance company who placed a multi-year, multi-million dollar order for Coverity delivered on Polaris. The power of our portfolio, the broadest in the industry, is evident in the growing number of high-value contracts and companies adopting multiple products. Industry recognition of our solution also continues to grow. Last month, for the first year in a row, Synopsys was named a Leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. In fact we were placed at the highest level. We are also again recognized as a Leader in The Forrester Wave for Software Composition Analysis for open source software. Importance rankings such as these substantiate our leadership for customers who are investing significantly and choosing their preferred partners.To summarize, we delivered another very strong quarter and are raising the top end of revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. We're making step by step progress in expanding our ops margin. Our new EDA product in the early stages of a multi-year adoption cycle are experiencing rapid and substantial adoption. Demand for our IP portfolio is high and we expect to deliver another year of low double-digit growth. And our software security and quality business is scaling well, reaching about 10% of total revenues and expected to reach profitability for the full year. Finally, I want to say thank you to the global Synopsys team for its continued hard work and commitment to helping our customers meet their importance and always urgent objectives.Let me now turn the call over to Trac. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. We continued to execute well, delivering good top and bottom line growth and non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. Operationally, we are on track for another outstanding year with an outlook that reflects high single-digit revenue growth on an apples to apples ASC 605 basis, substantial operating margin improvement and double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth.Last week's government action to restrict trade with one of our customers and its affiliates does have an impact on the business as we are currently unable to ship products, deliver software updates or provide support. As a result, we are now -- we are not able to book new business and recognition of currently contracted revenue is on hold. However, due to the strength of our first half, we're still able to raise our non-GAAP EPS guidance and the top end of our revenue range. I'll provide more details in a moment.Now to our Q2 numbers. All comparisons are year-over-year, unless otherwise stated, and all results are reported under ASC topic 606. For a summary of these results as well as equivalent financial metrics under ASC 605, please refer to our financial supplement.We generated consolidated total revenue of $836 million or 8% growth and saw broad-based strength across both segments. Semiconductor & System Design revenue was $753 million, up 6% or high-single digits, excluding hardware, which had a record second quarter last year. For Software Integrity, revenue was $83 million, an increase of 23% as that business continues to capitalize on market dynamics and gain share in this high growth market.Continuing down the income statement, consolidated total GAAP costs and expenses were $721 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $626 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25%. At the segment level, Semiconductor & System Design delivered an adjusted operating margin of 26.8%, the Software Integrity at 10.1%, reflecting both underlying strength and quarterly variability of revenue and expenses. Note that certain operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and other expenses that are managed at the consolidated level have not been allocated to our segments.We continue to expect Software Integrity to be profitable for the full year with a goal of reaching at least our consolidated quarterly margin over the long term. These operating results in turn drove GAAP earnings per share of $0.77 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.16. Turning to cash; operating cash flow was $353 million, driven by strong collections in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $631 million and total debt of $292 million.Before moving to guidance, let me provide some additional color around the impact of last week's government action. As I mentioned, we are not able to book new business with this customer and its affiliates. And revenue recognition for current contracts is on hold until either the contract expires or the restriction is lifted. Because the duration of the ban is unclear, we've expanded our ranges to account for an array of potential impacts. We believe that we will eventually be able to recognize the revenue depending on the timing of the ultimate resolution of the government action.Our targets based on ASC 606 for the fiscal year 2019 are: revenue of $3.29 billion to $3.35 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.798 billion and $2.853 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.505 billion and $2.525 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of just over 24%; other income and expenses between minus $12 million and minus $8 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $2.85 or $3.27 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $4.24 to $4.40 per share, an increase at the midpoint of $0.08 over our prior guidance; cash flow from operations of $670 million to $700 million, which reflects additional uncertainty due to the trade restrictions and some restructuring costs as we reallocate resources for future growth; and capital expenditures of approximately $270 million. We continue to expect CapEx to drop by roughly half in 2020.Now to the targets for the third quarter: revenue between $810 million and $850 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $700 million and $746 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $620 and $640 million; other income and expenses between minus $4 million and minus $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.60 to $0.83 per share, and non-GAAP earnings $1.07 to $1.12 per share.I'll conclude by reiterating our long-term financial objectives. Annual double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth, driven by revenue growth in high single-digits, reflecting mid to high single-digits for EDA, low double-digits for IP, and Software Integrity growth in the 20% range, and operating margin expansion to the high 20s by 2021 and in the 30% range longer term. Our execution in the first half reflects our commitment to driving near-term results that would put us on a path to achieving our longer-term operating objectives. Our capital allocation strategy enables us to meet these dual objectives while returning substantial value to shareholders. We maintain a balance of internal and external investments for growth and a robust share repurchase program.And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good afternoon. Aart, aside from the ban, which has some specific implications, would you say there's any other change in the outlook or the demand from your customers relative to a quarter ago? -- Actually I would say no, I don't think that there is material other change. There was some worry about three months ago that seems to have settled. I think the market is just readjusting itself among the companies who is doing better than others, but the end demand I think remains just as strong as it was before. -- Got it. And then Trac, just a clarification on the guidance for the rev rec with Huawei. So can we assume that the low end of your revenue range that there is no rev rec assumed for Huawei for the balance of the year, is that correct? -- That's correct, Rich. We tried to widen the range to capture the possibilities of the restrictions remaining in effect and then the higher end of the range, which reflects the execution in the first half, which has been very strong and the possibly that gets lifted in some reasonable amount of time. -- Right. So is it fair to say that the low end would have been going up had not you had this change with respect to Huawei? -- That's correct. -- Got it. And then with respect to the hardware business which obviously had a tough comp in Q2, but generally I think has kind of a tough comp for all of next year, I think when you came into this year, you were thinking that that would be flattish. I don't know if you gave that specific guidance but I sense with you sort of thinking about that being flattish, any change in thoughts on the hardware business now that we're a couple of quarters into the year? -- No, I think fundamentally, I think we have predicted it reasonably well. And while we didn't use those words, your words not all that far away from where we are. And so we do see good demand and broader demand, so that that is excellent. So in the long term I think that will just set the back. Last year was just particularly strong and actually overall so far this year is good in general. I think you characterized it correctly. -- Got it. Thanks very much, gentlemen. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from Tom Diffely with DA Davidson. Please go ahead. -- Yes, good afternoon. Following up on Rich's question on Huawei, were there application engineers on location that had been removed at this point? -- Well, I don't think we want to go into the intricacies or all the individual actions, but with all of our customers we have essentially constantly applications, engineers helping them. And right now we just follow exactly the rule set by the government and they include not giving specific support. -- Okay. And just one question on that, was it a combination of both traditional EDA tools as well as IP? Was one more significant than the other? -- Yeah, while we wouldn't break it into individual pieces, large companies typically are participants in all of our portfolio, so that would include tools and IP. -- Okay. Yes, let me say that some point there was some of the strong growth in IP comes from one of the Chinese customers as they are fairly new to this space. Okay. So I guess moving on, do you see other impacts from the the trade war, the tariffs, on your business and if you do, is there difference between delivering EDA traditionally versus over the cloud? -- No, we don't see any changes and I think it's too early to see any changes in the market period. Obviously there will be some readjustment of how different suppliers act. I'm talking about semiconductor companies. But I think it's really much too early to speculate, even in the last few days there have been changes. -- Okay. And then Trac, when I look at your full year view, obviously you've got the dampening effect of Huawei, but was there any other puts and takes that included (ph) in the spread or was it really just one particular event? -- It was really that isolated issue because when you look at -- they hurt first half results, you're seeing very good growth in the top line, margin improving very well against last year and you can see in our guidance for Q2 was very constructive. And so the widening of the guidance range really reflects the trade restrictions that went into effect last week. -- Great. Okay, thank you. -- You're welcome.Next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi, can you hear me? -- Yes, we can. -- Okay. I apologize, I'm on the road. So I have two questions. The first one pretty high level. So obviously, the US and China are kind of having higher tensions here, I mean of this too much, but is there a chance that essentially the Chinese vendors you guys are selling to outside of Huawei would want to push (inaudible) higher end node now? Now there is potential for it to get banned, wouldn't it make sense they would try to I guess try to invest in the higher tax. Do you have any thoughts on that? -- Well, I think that all companies that are in the semi arena are continually racing forward to try to provide products with the high-end nodes and the most sophisticated technology. I don't think that goes away under any economic scenario. And so this is one of the reasons why we think that overall our business outlook is very solid or strong because the demand given the applications that are being developed requires strong investments on the part of our customers in advanced technologies. And so, different companies will get there in different ways, but the race is definitely on. -- Got it. And second one I guess I'll let Trac hit the limelight for this one. So, when I look at the Software Integrity, it's not 10% margins already, that seems pretty substantial on a Q-over-Q basis. Can you help us understand how that ramps because I think that going 50% sequential growth in terms of margin perspective pretty high. So how do we model that going forward over next couple of years? -- Yes, let me start with this -- let's focus on this year. We're showing really good trend on Software Integrity and that's heading in the right direction after roughly five years in investment in that area. The profitability or the OM for that business is simply noisy from quarter to quarter. Keep in mind, it's a nascent market that's growing and the profile of that business will vary from quarter to quarter in terms of revenue growth, but still very strong and we will continue to invest in this area. So you'll see us talking to revenue growth and investments.For this year though we are certainly on track for profitability for the business. But I would just would be cautious about extrapolating too quickly on the Q1 results heading into Q2, but we definitely will be profitable. Longer term, given the dynamics and the nature of that business, we do expect it to be at least at the corporate average in terms of OM. -- Perfect. Thank you. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. I apologize, I don't know if it's the static or I didn't quite catch the following two questions around the China situation. The first one is, is it all revenue related to all products currently with that customer that's put on hold, is there anything else that potentially could come out of the revenue line over the coming quarters? And I got one follow-up. -- So the revenue guidance includes all revenues for all products related to that one customer. -- Okay. (Multiple Speakers) So there's no revenue at all coming for that customer in the income statement? -- That's correct. -- Got it. Perfect. And then the other one is, I didn't catch -- what about cash flow -- if there's a cash flow collections and payments? -- Yes. So our cash flow guidance of $670 million to $700 million does reflect a couple of new items, one is an impact of cash collections for that customer and probably it's a reflection of the fact that we aren't able to provide additional support for them. So the prudent outlook is to assume that the collections will be delayed. The other part is the restructuring that we took in Q2, a minor restructuring activity in Q2. -- I think that's very fair. That last element, FX impact on top and bottom line in the quarter and the outlook? -- Generally, immaterial to overall results. Keep in mind the one currency that's not denominated in USD is the yen, and that is hedged at the beginning of the year, so the top and bottom line is pretty much dampened by FX. -- Sounds good. Thank you so much. -- You're welcome.And our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. The follow-up question on the operating margin for the Software Integrity business, you mentioned long-term target of being at corporate average, presumably high 20%. What revenue level has to be achieved to get to that target? -- The model that we described for Software Integrity is roughly that 20% plus growth. And if we continue that path, the growth will be there and then over the last few years that only have we invested in the product portfolio and our go-to-market infrastructure, but we have also spent time building out the organizational infrastructure, the back office, whether it's systems or the processes to scale it up. So you'll continue to see improvements in operating margin through a combination of revenue growth in that 20% range and operating leverage as that business scales. -- Okay. Trac, you mentioned a minor restructuring in the second quarter, but I think the charge was the highest charge you've had in at least a few years. So could you shed some more light on what the restructuring was and perhaps what the headcount and part of groups might be impacted? -- Yeah, it's really, Gary, It's very much fine-tuning. We've committed to driving operating margin expansion with a focus on hitting the high 20s by 2021. We'll continue to invest in the business, that's important part across all areas. And as we tweak and tune it, we will try to -- our focus is making sure that we're emphasizing the business areas that is going to deliver the best combination of top line and -- top line growth and margin expansion. I think Q2 was just a function of that. -- Okay. And last question, I'll ask you quickly, hopefully it's a quick answer, but do you have handy the mix between merchant chip vendors and system OEMs and captively developed integrated circuits? -- Sorry, I don't follow that question. -- Well, what's your sales mix between merchant integrated circuit companies and system OEMs? -- Well, that ratio has never changed all that much, it was always sort of in the 40ish percentage for the system houses, but in all fairness, those definitions are becoming much fuzzier because a number of system companies that in the past that didn't do any chip design have now started to invest in chip teams and I think we mentioned some of those as being some of the -- the X cloud providers for example are some of the very large companies in the world and at the same time the other people that are dedicated to chip design are spending more money because it's more challenging. So fundamentally for us, the picture is changing, but it is not evolving away from those numbers. -- Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. -- You're welcome.(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good evening. Trac, just a quick clarification, you did not mention in your prepared remarks an updated backlog number as you did in Q1, if you could provide that. Second, for Aart, with respect to the restructuring that ties into a couple of questions that we had meant to ask you anyway, and that is back in September at an Investor Meeting in New York and again at the Analyst Meeting couple of months ago you referred to improving your internal processes related to the Company's profitability and Trac referred to efficiencies, but you didn't really go into much detail as to what you're doing, you are changing your cost structure here, but in what other operational and ongoing ways are you in fact going to improve those processes and efficiencies that you alluded to. And also it looks now, just a quick spot-check this afternoon once the restructuring news came out that your current job openings are the lowest in a year-and-a-half and it really looks like most of the pullback in openings is in the US and you still have a fair number of openings in China. So maybe just talk about all those issues together in terms of processes, cost structure, hiring? Thanks. -- So, let me start with your first question Jay, the backlog was around $4.3 billion, pretty consistent with where it was at the end of Q1. Overall the business, as you can see in the outlook, the business has been pretty healthy and run rate growth was actually up in Q2 again. I'll make a few comments on the fine-tuning of our business and Aart can provide more color, but it's really ranges across the board. For example, it goes from systems implementation. Over a couple of years ago we upgraded our ERP systems to get prepared for our 606 transition as well as the evolution of the business into different portfolios.Having that platform then allowed us to go in and spend time last year and continuing into this year looking at our infrastructure and the processes around the Software Integrity business and allowing us to scale. Some of that benefit you're seeing certainly in the profitability improvements in the first half, but really if you're looking at our business processes and then the systems that are supporting that business, the CRM system that supports that business which is very different than what we're traditionally used to, it's much higher volume, lower dollar in absolute terms relative to the EDA and IP business. Those are two examples of the sort of things that we're looking at, but you can see in some ways they're big heavy lifts in terms of creating the infrastructure, but they are the appropriate things that you would want to do in terms of scaling the business from where we are today at $3 billion to the next level of ambition. -- Yeah. So maybe I can comment a little bit going back to, I forgot exactly if it's two or three quarters ago when we communicated to you that we had essentially executed on a multi-year investment push with a number of acquisitions specifically creating the Software Integrity group, but also a number of pushes on the tools side and broadening our IP portfolio. And so we are continuing on all these investments because I think we invested in the right direction and things are looking quite good there.At the same time as we communicated to you that we were putting additional emphasis on improving the ops margin after this round of investment, we are not only looking at all the infrastructure tasks and all the processes as Trac mentioned, but literally going through every business and looking at, so which products have higher potential, which areas in the world are area with customers need additional emphasis or can be slightly reduced, and even what verticals are of interest and we have done very well, for example, in the automotive side, but there may be others that we could consider.And so it is actually a whom list of a lot of fine-tuning, but the fine-tuning does have an impact. As to the openings, I do think that we have a very large number of openings at this point in time. They do change from time to time also because business units we visit where the needs are, how these have evolved, which positions have been filled, what are we looking for, and they also move a little bit from geography to geography as a function of the situation. So I wouldn't say there's anything abnormal in that, but I think we are very serious and well organized to keep pushing on the ops margin and if you have watched the results in the last few quarters, you should at least get an inkling that we're heading in the right direction. -- Thank you. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. -- Hi, can you guys hear me? -- Yes. -- Staying on the margin topic, even your Semi and System operating margins increased by 30 bps quarter-to-quarter. How should we think about linearity of those margins? I appreciate your comments on the variability of the other segment, but how should we look at the core margin? -- Yeah, if you look on a multi-year basis, you should see a steady progression from where we are, where we were last year to where we want to be in 2021, which is the high 20s, you'll see a steady progression toward that. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, it can be very -- highly variable, very lumpy given the mix of the business that we ship that particular quarter or the contracts are in play that quarter, but overall you should see that trend on an upward trajectory. -- Okay. And then relative to the new ZeBu 4 product, you said you're getting some good feedback from customers, can you maybe provide some more color on that? -- Sure. One of the key capabilities of the ZeBu 4 is a) that it is faster, and b) that it can do much larger capacity and the fact that you can really scale your capacity as required by the needs of the customer. Lastly, the cost per computation is the lowest on the market. And so that makes for an attractive solution. It's actually a solution that has also found some really harry problems to solve, such as can you start running software on hardware that you don't have yet, or in other words can can you virtualize your designs, can you implement them in an emulator before you actually have the silicon, and that is turning out to be both a very challenging problem, but one that we are well equipped for. So we're very encouraged where this is going and if nothing else, we've also seen in the last few quarters that we are broadening the number of customers that are intrigued or that actually have started to use this. -- Great, thanks.And our next question comes from Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Hi, this is actually (inaudible) on for Gal. I just wanted to revisit the China contract that you said was on hold. We're just wondering, how long do you think that would be on hold. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned how system companies are driving software verification, are these customers purchasing hardware as well or is that not necessarily for the complexity of their designs? -- Our guidance is focused on FY19. So the range, particularly on the lower end reflects the the possibility that the restrictions are in effect for the rest of the year. In the event that it does change, then we would expect it to be on the higher end of our revenue and earnings guidance. -- Regarding your question on prototyping, most customers, if not all, really use both, meaning that if you -- let me say it differently, the people that use hardware invariably also use the software because that's typically how they got to know us in the first place, for smaller problems you try to get as far along as you can on the software. And once the speed is woefully inadequate and the complexity has grown, that's where people start using the hardware to get much faster results and we have multiple variations on that theme, by the way. So the other comment I would make is that it's one thing to do very, very fast simulations, it's another thing to actually diagnose what happens when something goes wrong. And so that's where the debugging is extremely important and we have a very, very powerful set of software debugging capabilities that work with both our software simulator and with the emulators.Okay, great. And what's the length of those kinds of contracts? -- Our duration in general is typically three years. It runs around three years.Okay. And then I just had one more on your Polaris platform, is that platform completely built in and if not what's left to be integrated and what is the roadmap for completion and how should we think about that for the benefits to your margins. -- Okay. Let me take one step back and say what is the platform all about. Well, the platform is all about to let software developers use really a multiplicity of tools that can detect a variety of quality and security issues as you develop the code. And so you have to realize that it's a little bit more than a year ago that we actually acquired one of the bigger pieces of our products. And so the objective for early -- for this year and it turned out to us early in the spring this year was to have the first version of the Polaris platform that aims at bringing all of our products together, including by the way some services through that platform also.What we have today that some customers have already purchased is the platform with the first set of tools and Coverity was the first set of tools that is on there. As we now progress through the next 12 to 18 months, more and more of our tools will become available. The last comment about this is that why is this particularly relevant for the larger companies, because if you are that, you know, the CSO (ph) or the Head of IT in a large company, you have a lot of challenges around security and of course for each challenge there are 10 different companies that have some miracle cure and while we do not participate in many of these remedial situations, what we intend to provide is the best development environment that can constantly diagnose and early indicate issues so that the development is better in the first place.And for that, the ITs or Heads of ITs or CSOs would rather have one trusted broader partner as long as both the stuff works together and that's very easily said and so difficult to do. And this is why we're so excited about Polaris platform because we are making things work together really well, and of course we have 25 years of lessons learned from EDA on how to do that and now we are applying all of these lessons to Software Integrity space.Okay, great, thank you very much.And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I will turn it back over to the host for any closing remarks. -- Sure. Let me ask start by apologizing on the static. While we don't hear any of that, so you've been loud and clear to us. I hope that the messaging at least came across and if nothing else, we understand that there is quite a bit of noise in the market and most of those things, there is no control we can have over that situation. But in general, our business has been strong in the first two quarters of the year, is looking good for Q3. And so we are continuing on per terms on our trajectory. And we appreciate all the interest that you had in this earnings release. Have a good afternoon.And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

"nvestors eyeing a purchase of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $127.19/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $110 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.30.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.1% return against the $110 commitment, or a 4.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).



Selling a put does not give an investor access to SNPS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $110 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Synopsys Inc sees its shares decline 13.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $107.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.30 from $110), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.2% annualized rate of return.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $110 strike is located relative to that history:
  

   
The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $110 strike for the 4.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Synopsys Inc (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $127.19) to be 26%.

In mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.11M contracts, with call volume at 1.11M, for a put:call ratio of 0.70 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65.  In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today.

Moreover, these notes will carry an interest rate of 3.125%, 3.125%, 3.625%, 4.250% and 4.750%, respectively.The offering of the notes will be concluded on Apr 5, 2019, upon fulfillment of customary closing conditions. The offering reflects the company's intention to repay outstanding amount under its revolving credit facility.The notes will be privately offered to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A, which is exempted from registration requirements under the United States Securities Act of 1933. We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and fuel long-term growth.The company reported first-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $5.55 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.19. The figure also improved 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations were $5.789 billion, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter and 6.3% sequentially. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.816.Shares of Broadcom have returned approximately 32.1% year over year, outperforming the  's rally of 22.9%.We believe that the senior notes offering will lower Broadcom's cost of capital, consequently strengthening balance sheet and supporting growth initiatives.Broadcomexited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalent balance of $5.1 billion, up from $4.3 billion reported in the previous quarter Broadcom generated cash flow from operations of roughly $2.1 billion compared with $2.6 billion in the previous quarter. Free cash flow during the quarter under review was $2 billion.Broadcomhas an excellen  surprise history as the stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive surprise of 4.3%. We expect the company to record earnings growth of 11.1% and 14.1% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.The company's strong relationships with leading OEMs across multiple target markets have helped it in gaining key insights into the requirements of customers. These insights have enhanced the company's efficiency and productivity in serving the target markets and customers better.Further, Broadcom's expanding product portfolio makes it well poised to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G.Moreover, we believe that the company is well positioned to benefit from synergies from the CA buyout. In fact, CA's strength in enterprise software offerings and substantial customer base is anticipated to enable Broadcom in exploring the infrastructure software market and expand its TAM.Currently, Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Chicago, IL -March 19, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft  , Facebook  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corp.  . and Facebook recently initiated Co-Packaged Optics (""CPO"") Collaboration as part of joint Development Foundation. The CPO Collaboration is aimed at providing end-to-end design guidelines and open specifications to suppliers.The companies expect the guidelines to enable industry suppliers to accelerate manufacturing processes of co-packaged or embedded or on-board optics. Consequently, the final designed package can be embedded into the network switch's PCB or printed circuit board.Per the press release, ""The collaboration has targeted the 51T switch generation as the tipping point for industry adoption of co-packaged optics.""Eventually, the companies are aspiring to create a diverse and open design ecosystem with the CPO Collaboration.To quote, Jeff Cox, executive director of the CPO Collaboration and partner director, Network Architecture, at Microsoft, ""As co-founders of the Co-Packaged Optics Collaboration, Microsoft and Facebook invite customers and suppliers to join and collaborate with us.""Further, the CPO Collaboration will review and assess proposals (aimed at bolstering the adoption of open, technical solutions) put forward by optical and switch suppliers.Growing hyperscale computing industry calls for the evolution of datacenter infrastructure. As a result, switch hardware designs are increasingly focusing on integrating optical connectivity directly into network-switching ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit).With an aim to address greater networking demands of cloud service providers (or CSPs), network switch makers are exploring ways to utilize CPO technology.Notably, Co-packaging or embedding optics directly with ASICs cuts down the length of switch-optic interconnects. This approach provides the industry players with robust cost-efficient interconnect solutions with improved use of silicon and reduced power consumption.Per HTF data as revealed by MarketWatch, the optical interconnect market is expected to be $16.62 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 20.9%.Shares of Microsoft have returned 26.9% in the past year, outperforming the  's rally of 21.9%. This outperformance can be primarily attributed to company's rapidly expanding efforts in AI and IoT based developments. Undisturbed focus on enhancing Azure capabilities remains a key catalyst.The race to provide networking equipment solutions which are compatible with the emerging technologies and growing data-centric requirements is intensifying. The growing clout of optics to address emerging network infrastructure demands of power and density, primarily among CSPs deserves a special mention.Microsoft is leaving no stone unturned to devise robust platforms aimed at realizing the potential of CPO technology.In fact, the company recently open-sourced its Project Zipline. This will enable hardware developers to access algorithms and software tools enabling them to design cost-effective power-efficient high compression chips.The company is also one of the founding members of The Consortium for On-Board Optics (COBO). COBO aims to ""develop specifications for board-mounted optical modules.""With these innovative initiatives, Microsoft is anticipated to strengthen the hardware infrastructure capabilities of Azure's data centers.

 is benefitting from a strong uptick across all product groups plus large and expanded renewals with some key semiconductor companies. The company's penetration into new and growing artificial intelligence (AI) chip companies is a major growth driver.Further, with the growing need for enhanced security measures given the worsening security threats in interconnected systems laden with software, demand for the company's solutions is shooting up.Notably, the company's investments in this high-growth market are helping it diversify its customer base in financial services and medical segments apart from extending its reach in the automotive and ramping up business with well-established electronics clients.Growth across AI and automotive sectors is driving demand for the company's IP products.Recently, Synopsys partnered with GLOBALFOUNDRIES to develop a portfolio of IPs that will support high temperature operation on the latter's 22-nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator (22FDX) technology.The IP will help designers ease their design efforts and expedite the AEC-Q100 qualification of SoCs for automotive applications like eMobility, 5G connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and infotainment.Moreover, Fusion Design Platform, launched last November, is witnessing steep demand, which is aiding it to generate solid results. A strong progress in the company's fusion technology and platform roll-out is driving EDA (Electronic design automation) revenues, which in turn, is boosting its top line.The company recently announced that its Fusion Compiler RTL-to-GDSII implementation solution has been unveiled by Renesas Electronics Corporation to accelerate the development of the latter's next-generation automotive designs. The Fusion Compiler will power Renesas' high-performance automotive system-on-chips (SoCs) and mission-critical microcontrollers.In the current economic scenario, as customers are strengthening their supplier relations and focusing on cost efficiencies, many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner. Connections with companies, such as Advanced Micro Devices  , Juniper Networks  , Realtek, Teradici, NetLogic Microsystems, Toshiba and Wolfson stand as a clear evidence.Notably, the newly-introduced updated version of Synopsys' IC Validator NXT has already been successfully deployed in the cloud by multiple customers to address their dynamic tapeout schedules.However, the company faces a tough competition from EDA vendors, namely Cadence Design Systems  and Mentor Graphics Corporation, which is n overhang on the company.In addition to the stocks discussed above, wouldn't you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?From more than 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank, these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market.

" recently introduced its updated version of IC Validator - IC Validator NXT - to meet the physical verification engineers' advanced and important productivity needs.The most important capability of this physical verification solution is that design teams will be able to doubly reduce their physical signoff cycle for the advanced technology nodes.The Synopsys IC Validator, which has been successfully delivering performance scalability and providing support to all mainstream and advanced process nodes for a decade, significantly lowers the time-to-results through near-linear scalability across numerous CPU cores. This solution has been adopted by industry leaders such as NVIDIA  and IC provider Aquantia.The IC Validator NXT runs on the Design Rule Checking technology just like the previous generation validator and enables five times faster run-time with equally fewer CPUs during SoC (system on chip) integration among other key offerings.Dan Page, vice president, Design Group, Synopsys, said: ""As designers adopt 7-nanometer and newer technology nodes, physical verification closure within schedule is becoming a major challenge, and tapeout delays can have a significant impact on our customers' product lifetime revenue and profitability.""Notably, IC Validator NXT has already been successfully deployed in the cloud by multiple customers to address their dynamic tapeout schedules.The IC Validator is an important component of Synopsys' Fusion Design Platform, which is witnessing a strong adoption among clients and is driving the company's top line. The platform contributed majorly to the 5% year-over-year increase in the company's Semiconductor & System Design revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.The IC Validator is a key product in Synopsys' core electronic design automation (EDA) family. A solid progress in fusion technology and platform roll-out is driving EDA revenues.However, the company faces tough competition from EDA vendors, such as Cadence Design Systems  and Mentor Graphics Corporation, now belonging to Siemens AG  . These companies offer products, focusing more on distinct phases of the IC design process and providing a range of services to companies throughout the world to help optimize respective product development processes among other things. The players' facilities could intensify rivalry, inducing soft prices and depleted profits for Synopsys.Nonetheless, we believe that the technological expertise and a strong hold in the market will help sustain the company's leadership and enable it to withstand stiff contest.Moreover, per a recent Technavio report, the global EDA market size is expected to grow by more than $3.67 billion during the 2019-2023 time period.

In the same period, the stock has outperformed S&P 500 index's growth of 12.6%.We note that Oracle has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.97% in the trailing four quarters. Moreover, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 9.8%.Let's delve deeper and analyze the factors driving Oracle's robust quarterly performances.Oracle is benefiting from increasing adoption of its product portfolio and synergies from strategic buyouts. Moreover, ongoing cloud-based momentum bodes well for the company's top line.Recently, Things Remembered opted for Oracle Customer Experience (""CX"") Cloud suite's Commerce Cloud solution to enhance business, resulting in a new customer win for Oracle. The company's focus on strengthening the comprehensive cloud-based SaaS application suites for its CX cloud offering is anticipated to drive adoption, in turn favoring the top line.Oracle also introduced Oracle Retail Xstore Office Cloud Service and announced several enhancements to Retail Omnichannel suite at National Retail Federation (""NRF"") 2019. Oracle's move to ramp up Retail Omnichannel product suite, is in sync with the company's strategy to capitalize on the digital commerce market and strengthen competitive position against peers like Salesforce.com, SAP, Adobe (especially after Magento acquisition), among others.Oracle Retail also announced collaboration with One Door in a bid to strengthen retail clientele's in-store merchandising methods with advanced assortment and layout techniques. This incremental adoption of Oracle's services is anticipated to aid financial performance of the company in the foreseeable future.Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now available. The new database is projected to generate incremental revenues for the company, going ahead. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle's competitive position in the cloud against Amazon's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (""AWS"").Additionally, traction witnessed by Oracle NetSuite bodes well. NetSuite was recently selected by UAE-based Denaster General Trading LLC. With NetSuite deployment, the retail distributor attempts to expand business beyond Middle East, particularly in the U.K. and India.Oracle delivered third-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of 87 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. Revenues of $9.618 billion marginally outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.608 billion.Earnings increased approximately 8% from the year-ago quarter (up 12% in cc). Notably, revenues decreased 1% year over year but increased 3% in cc. This was toward the higher range of management's guidance of 2-4% in cc.Oracle's top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud services and license support revenues (70% of total revenues) for the las  ed quarter advanced 1% (4% in constant currency) to $6.66 billion.Oracle repurchased around 206 million shares worth $10 billion during the reported quarter. Over the last 12 months, the company repurchased 728 million shares. It also increased the quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share (up 26% from the previous quarter), payable on Apr 25, 2019. The dividend payout appears sustainable backed by strong and relatively stable cash flow, which in turn makes the stock quite attractive.Oracle has solid growth prospects, as is apparent from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2020 earnings of $3.69 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 8.4%. Meanwhile, the company's revenues are anticipated to increase by 2.5% in fiscal 2020.However, stiff competition in the cloud is expected to hurt margins and will make revenue growth difficult, going forward. Further, large acquisitions can negatively impact the company's balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets. Further, lawsuits and currency volatility, owing to its transition from licensing to cloud, are likely to affect Oracle.We expect the aforementioned factors to aid the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors retain the stock for the time being.Currently, Oraclecarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" and Facebook  recently initiated Co-Packaged Optics (""CPO"") Collaboration as part of joint Development Foundation. The CPO Collaboration is aimed at providing end-to-end design guidelines and open specifications to suppliers.The companies expect the guidelines to enable industry suppliers to accelerate manufacturing processes of co-packaged or embedded or on-board optics. Consequently, the final designed package can be embedded into the network switch's PCB or printed circuit board.Per the press release, ""The collaboration has targeted the 51T switch generation as the tipping point for industry adoption of co-packaged optics.""Eventually, the companies are aspiring to create a diverse and open design ecosystem with the CPO Collaboration.To quote, Jeff Cox, executive director of the CPO Collaboration and partner director, Network Architecture, at Microsoft, ""As co-founders of the Co-Packaged Optics Collaboration, Microsoft and Facebook invite customers and suppliers to join and collaborate with us.""Further, the CPO Collaboration will review and assess proposals (aimed at bolstering the adoption of open, technical solutions) put forward by optical and switch suppliers.Growing hyperscale computing industry calls for the evolution of datacenter infrastructure. As a result, switch hardware designs are increasingly focusing on integrating optical connectivity directly into network-switching ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit).With an aim to address greater networking demands of cloud service providers (or CSPs), network switch makers are exploring ways to utilize CPO technology.Notably, Co-packaging or embedding optics directly with ASICs cuts down the length of switch-optic interconnects. This approach provides the industry players with robust cost-efficient interconnect solutions with improved use of silicon and reduced power consumption.Per HTF data as revealed by MarketWatch, the optical interconnect market is expected to be $16.62 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 20.9%.Shares of Microsoft have returned 26.9% in the past year, outperforming the  's rally of 21.9%. This outperformance can be primarily attributed to company's rapidly expanding efforts in AI and IoT based developments. Undisturbed focus on enhancing Azure capabilities remains a key catalyst.The race to provide networking equipment solutions which are compatible with the emerging technologies and growing data-centric requirements is intensifying. The growing clout of optics to address emerging network infrastructure demands of power and density, primarily among CSPs deserves a special mention.Microsoft is leaving no stone unturned to devise robust platforms aimed at realizing the potential of CPO technology.In fact, the company recently open-sourced its Project Zipline. This will enable hardware developers to access algorithms and software tools enabling them to design cost-effective power-efficient high compression chips.The company is also one of the founding members of The Consortium for On-Board Optics (COBO). COBO aims to ""develop specifications for board-mounted optical modules.""With these innovative initiatives, Microsoft is anticipated to strengthen the hardware infrastructure capabilities of Azure's data centers.

" recently introduced Game Stack with an aim to provide developers with a comprehensive platform, enabling them to design, test, publish and monetize on engaging games.As part of Game Stack, the developers can access Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure, and game development tools including PlayFab, Visual Studio, DirectX, Xbox Live, Havok and App Center. Notably, the company expects developers to choose Azure as the preferred cloud partner, although it is not a compulsion.With an intention to democratize innovation, the company extended the availability of Xbox Live to Android and iOS devices via a new SDK (software development kit) as part of Game Stack.Also, management is looking forward to demonstrate its new services at Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2019, to be held on Mar 18-22 at San Francisco, CA.We believe, these initiatives will enable the company to enhance its competitive position against Amazon's  Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud platform. Notably, Amazon GameLift cloud-based service enables developers to deploy, scale, operate and manage multiplayer game servers. Google is reportedly working on subscription-based streaming service, dubbed Project Yeti.Apart from Game Stack, Microsoft rolled out five PlayFab services, namely PlayFab Matchmaking, PlayFab Party, PlayFab Insights, PlayFab PubSub and PlayFab User Generated Content.PlayFab Matchmaking, inspired by Xbox Live matchmaking, is available for use. Meanwhile, the remaining four are under preview.Notably, the company acquired PlayFab last January with an objective to up its game in cloud gaming market. PlayFab provides a backend services platform to help developers design and introduce enthralling cloud-connected games.We believe, the integration of PlayFab platform with Azure and Game Stack bodes well. The managed game-development tools and LiveOps capabilities of PlayFab are expected to complement Azure's strength in game telemetry analytics, player data security and immersive gamer experience through robust machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) skills.Microsoft announced that PlayFab will continue to support the major game engine platforms, cloud platforms and devices (running on Android or iOS), going forward.This shows Microsoft's efficient evolution on multiple platforms and open source infrastructure, thereby enabling third-party developers to build innovative tools on any device or network.Microsoft is leaving no stone unturned to integrate cloud capabilities of Azure into its gaming segment. This is allowing the company to innovate its gaming domain beyond exclusive gaming content on X-box consoles.Microsoft anticipates Azure's availability scale across 54 regions globally to strengthen its upcoming ""Project xCloud streaming technology"", targeting to provide an immersive gaming experience. Notably, with Project xCloud, users can stream games across major device options with suitable latency levels.Notably, Azure already aids prominent companies like Wizards of the Coast, Rare and Ubisoft to host multiplayer game servers and monetize exciting gameplay in a secure infrastructure.Per latest IHS Markit data, ""consumer spending on cloud gaming content subscriptions reached $234 million in 2018 and is forecast to grow to $1.5 billion by 2023.""We believe Microsoft's domain expertise in gaming and strength in Azure sets it apart from peers in both cloud and gaming sectors. The same also positions the company well to capitalize on the cloud gaming market.In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Microsoft's gaming revenues increased 8% (9% at constant currency) to $2.25 billion, driven by a robust performance from Xbox software and services (up 32% at cc) owing to third-party title strength. | For fiscal third quarter, Microsoft anticipates Gaming revenues to grow at a moderate rate. The company is likely to benefit from an improving user engagement.Microsoft seems to gain traction from the cloud gaming industry with the latest breakthroughs. The company's increasing investments will possibly expand its market reach and drive innovation in the streaming games.Microsoft is not only focusing on an exclusive original content but also making gaming easily accessible to all consumers including mobile users, which is a positive.

"omentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Synopsys currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of In order to see if SNPS is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of software used to test and develop chips holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For SNPS, shares are up 0.01% over the past week while the Zacks Computer - Software industry is down 1.76% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.92% compares favorably with the industry's 2.09% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Synopsys have risen 27.95%, and are up 22.56% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.73% and 3.68%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to SNPS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SNPS is currently averaging 1,130,117 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes.

" .  in collaboration with Xilinx  , Arm and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited  recently introduced Arm Neoverse N1 System Development Platform (""SDP"").Neoverse N1 SDP is touted to be the industry's first infrastructure development platform based on TSMC's 7 nanometer (nm) process which is verified by Cadence's robust tool flow. The latest SDP utilizes Cadence IP for PCI Express (PCIe) Gen 4, DDR4 PHY IP and CCIX.The SDP features Arm's Neoverse N1-based system-on-chip (""SoC"") which runs on operating frequency of 2.6-3GHz. Moreover, the SDP based on Cadence's latest 7 nm optimized system IP is loaded with high bandwidth memory and full-sized cache.Notably, in September 2017, Cadence partnered with Xilinx and TSMC for the development of CCIX based on 7 nanometer (nm) FinFET (Fin Field Effect Transistor) technology scheduled for delivery in 2018.Coming to price performance, shares of Cadence have returned 56.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming the  's rally of 19%.The Neoverse N1 SDP is primarily aimed at providing software and hardware developers a robust platform to customize the design of Arm's Neoverse N1 SoCs on TSMC's 7nm silicon technology.By utilizing the platform which provides a sturdy cloud-to-edge architecture, developers can build advance edge computing applications.Per the press release, ""The robustness of the SDP is ideal for development, debug, performance optimization and workload analysis on a wide range of applications including those for machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics.""In a bid to further enhance data center performance and reduce total cost of ownership (""TCO""), developers can use Xilinx's Alveo U280 Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (""CCIX"") accelerator card. Notably, the CCIX card connects the SDP with Xilinx's Virtex UltraScale+ FPGAs, which aids developers in designing applications with improved efficiency.Notably, Arm's Neoverse N1 SoC offers around 30% greater compute efficiency gain compared with prior Neoverse infrastructure CPUs. Moreover, the N1 platform can be scaled from sub-35W systems to big hyperscale cloud data servers.The efficiency and scalability features of the CPU are amplified when combined with Cadence's robust workflow based on TSMC's 7nm and Xilinx's accelerator card.Furthermore, the developers can access software stack of Neoverse N1 SDP via GitHub and Linaro open-source repositories.The Neoverse N1 SDP is slated to be available in second quarter of 2019 in restricted quantities with availability ofhigher volumesscheduled in subsequent quarters. Notably, the Neoverse N1 Rapid Adoption Kit (RAK) is available.Cadence is leaving no stone unturned to assist its customers in reducing time-to-market by accelerating their SoC design processes.The company is benefiting from robust adoption of the company's PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express) and DDR products in the IP segment.Further, Cadence is focusing on providing end-to-end solutions, which rapidly reduces the time required to introduce a semiconductor product in the market. In this regard, the company's frequent product launches and enhancements bode well.In fact, the company recently rolled out LPDDR5 IP solution utilizing TSMC's 7 nm FinFET process technology. Notably, Cadence Denali Gen2 IP, the ""industry's first"" silicon-based as well as LPDDR5 (Low-Power Double Data Rate) standard IP solution, is available.Notably, Cadence's buyout of nusemi inc, a company that develops high-speed Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) communications IP, to complement its existing SerDes solutions, deserves a special mention.With the integration of nusemi's technologies, Cadence is well poised to deliver efficient, cost saving and high bandwidth functionality for telecom segments, edge computing and networking services.Moreover, increasing investments on Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity.Furthermore, growing clout of Cadence's IP solutions particularly in the edge-computing and high performance computing (HPC) end-market holds promise. In fact, per Grand View Research estimates, HPC market is projected to witness a CAGR of 7.2% to reach $59.65 billion by 2025.We believe that incremental adoption of the offerings will favor financial performance of IP segment going ahead.Currently, Cadence sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Synopsys, Inc.  is another top-ranked stock in the same industry flaunting a Zacks Rank #1.

"Chicago, IL - March 8, 2019 - Stocks in this week's article are  ,  ,  ,  and  .A healthy business with steady sales growth is key to survival in today's fast changing and highly competitive business environment. As such, higher revenues are necessary to drive growth, and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise.Though a company might not be profitable over a particular period, it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations. In cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis, they are valued based on sales. This is because sales growth (or decline) is usually an early indicator of the company's future earnings performance.The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio takes into account a company's revenues when valuing it. It is key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate sales numbers as they can with earnings.While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision-making, this in isolation doesn't indicate much about a company's future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.So, consideration of a company's cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments. Also, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine. But powerful screening tools is just the start. That is why Zacks created the Screen of the Week to highlight profitable stock picking strategies that investors can actively use.Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" were generated by the stock-picking system that has more than doubled the market from 1988 through 2016.

" recently announced that it has been awarded a $57 million worth Seaport-e task order with a one year base period and four more optional years, by the U.S. Navy.Per the contract, Science Applications will provide engineering services to the Polymers and Undersea Sensors Branch at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (""NSWC""), Crane Division.Moreover, the company will offer R&D services, rapid prototype development and test and evaluation, among other services.The services are based on the Product Support Center services model that Science Applications co-developed with NSWC Crane, with which it has a 30-year partnership. The model includes life cycle support to systems and platforms with solution analysis, system engineering and integration, and sustainment.This task order announcement follows another Seaport-e task order worth $37 million, which was awarded to Science Applications a few days ago to provide its mission support services to the NSWC, Panama City.Science Applications is perennially benefiting from back-to-back contract wins. The government's inclination to adopt technologies is a positive for the company. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019 it recorded $10.4 billion total backlog.Furthermore, having the government as a big client lends stability to the business and moderates fluctuation in revenues. Although the government generally has a lengthy approval process, the project earns money for a number of years after it is approved.Moreover, government contracts improve the visibility of future revenue streams. Science Applications has been doing very well with a record level of awards, which reflects its disciplined business development actions, consistent operational excellence and high customer satisfaction.The company continues to execute its strategy of winning high-value contracts, delivering excellence to customers and deploying capital for growth. Its robust business model is expected to help it grow further.Competition from CACI International  in the federal marketplace remains steady. During its las  ed quarter, awards bagged by CACI included a five-year, $73 million contract with the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Its acquisition of the Systems Engineering and Acquisition Support Services Business Unit led the company to secure this award.Nonetheless, Science Application's recent buyout of government IT service provider Engility is expected to boost its growth in key markets and enhance its competitive position. This is because Engility provides skilled personnel to the U.S. departments of defense, homeland security and justice. Notably, Engility was the buyout target of five big companies in the past, including CACI, which was apparently the runner up to Science Applications. This makes us optimistic about the company's growth prospects. | Science Applications currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A couple of other top-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Fortinet, Inc.  and Synopsys, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

" recently announced at SXSW conference, that SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain offering is being utilized by Bumble Bee Foods.With the adoption of SAP's blockchain solution, Bumble Bee attempts to address the evolving customer demand to know the credibility of seafood's sourcing and safeness of consumption.The distributed ledger technology of SAP's blockchain service enables end-users to track the route of seafood (from ocean to dinner table) in its entirety.The users can scan the QR code imprinted on ""Bumble Bee Foods' Natural Blue by Anova yellowfin tuna"" package to obtain comprehensive data of the comprehensive fish-to-market journey on their smartphones.Per the press release, ""Bumble Bee is the first food company to incorporate SAP blockchain technology into its production.""We believe incremental adoption of SAP's blockchain service on the back of robust visibility and traceability features is expected to favor the top line. | SAP cloud platform supports Hyperledger fabric, multiple-chain nodes and Quorum nodes to enable customers in innovating and developing robust blockchain tools.The company is developing a blockchain-based solution along with Boehringer Ingelheim to track pharmaceuticals throughout the supply chain. This will be a notable step against the abuse of drugs.Notably, SAP Leonardo offering integrates Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Machine Learning, Analytics and Blockchain capabilities on the SAP Cloud platform. The solution has been witnessing traction of late. In fact, Barclaycard selected SAP's Leonardo solution in the last-reported quarter.The company's initiatives to aid its clientele in delivering products with reduced time-to-market by utilizing blockchain technology bodes well. In fact, blockchain technology market is projected to reach $23.3 billion by 2023 from estimated $1.2 billion in 2018 at a CAGR of 80.2%, per data from MarketsandMarkets.The secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the blockchain technology. Originally utilized for cryptocurrency transactions, the system is transparent and incorruptible and is meant to provide unaltered information.Since blockchain uses a distributed consensus, tampering with its records without being noticed by an entire network is difficult. This makes the system extremely safe. With minimum chances of double counting and hacking, the possibility of monetary losses is low. Consequently, we believe SAP's blockchain initiatives in the evolving logistics industry hold promise.Driven by multi-industrial adoption, blockchain technology has rapidly gained traction over the last few years. In fact, per Orbisresearch.com data as revealed by Reuters, blockchain technology is anticipated to be used by 65% of enterprises by 2020. Given its market presence and growing collaborations, SAP is well positioned to reap the benefits.The solutions offered by other key players in this domain like International Business Machines  , Microsoft, Accenture, have been adopted by the insurance, banking, food supply and automobile industries among others.SAP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 recently unveiled the HP OfficeJet Pro series of smart printers aimed to benefit small enterprises at the HP Reinvent event.The new printers feature self-healing Wi-Fi and strong security. The printers are up to 39% smaller than previous generations to suit small businesses, which cannot run without printers but suffer from space crunch.The OfficeJet Pro series (9015, 9025 and Premier) will be available from this month at key office and electronic retailers, as well as on HP's website. Meanwhile, the HP OfficeJet Pro Series (8025, 8035) variants will be available from June onward.HP has been focusing on its profit-generating Printing business for some time now. The acquisition of Samsung Electronics' S-Print was strategic move to further boost the business.HP is also increasing investments on its A3 multifunction printers (MFPs). These printers are designed to disrupt the traditional A3 copier category. We believe that the successful deployment of the new A3 MFPs printers will improve the company's revenues.Additionally, HP expects its acquisition of Europe's largest independent provider of print and document services, Apogee Corporation, to drive growth in contractual office print market.Notably, per MarketsandMarkets, the global digital printing market is expected to reach $28.9 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 4.48% between 2017 and 2023. Growing demand for sustainable printing, development of packaging and textile industries, and reduction in per unit cost of printing with digital printers are likely to drive the market. This projection bodes well for HP.Despite the company's continued efforts to boost its high-margin Printing business, rising macro uncertainties and price sensitivity among customers are undermining it. Change in customer purchasing behavior with more commercial customers buying items online negatively impacted HP's Supplies share in the las  ed quarter.Management further highlighted that all commercial customers are purchasing supplies online, and the company has a lower market share in that space compared to its share of traditional commercial resellers and in-store retailers.Further, given the high inventory and pricing issues, the company expects sales for the Printing segment to decline over the rest of the year.Moreover, HP faces stiff competition in this business from the likes of Xerox Corporation and Seiko Epson Corporation.It remains to be seen whether the new suit of inkjet printers can benefit this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock. | A few top-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Fortinet, Inc.  , Synopsys, Inc.  and eGain Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" recently filed a lawsuit against Foxconn's parent company Hon Hai.Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd.,is an electronics contract manufacturing company.The tech giant in a court filing with United States District Court for the Northern District of California stated that the Taiwan-based Foxconn didn't abide by the patent-licensing  inked in 2013.Per the filing, Foxconn is accused of defaulting on ""twice-yearly royalty"" payments. Per CNBC, ""Microsoft is suing for royalty repayment with interest, a review of Hon Hai's books and attorney fees.""Additionally, Foxconn is alleged to have not furnished the required documents as requested by third party audit firm, Deloitte. Reportedly, in 2017, Foxconn had approved a deal to comply with the audit terms of Deloitte.Per the terms of the pact inked in 2013, Hon Hai is supposed to pay royalty payments to Microsoft on gaining Chrome and Android patent licenses.Although the content covered in Microsoft's patent portfolio has been kept confidential from public domain, the copy of the agreement has been reportedly attached with the lawsuit.It is to be noted in this regard that several Android device makers including LG, Samsung  , HTC, to mention a few, are part of Microsoft's patent licensing program.Microsoft's research and development (R&D) initiatives set it apart from its peers.

 healthy business with steady sales growth is key to survival in today's fast changing and highly competitive business environment. As such, higher revenues are necessary to drive growth, and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise.Though a company might not be profitable over a particular period, it usually generates revenues unless there are unforeseen situations. In cases when companies tend to incur a loss on a temporary basis, they are valued based on sales. This is because sales growth (or decline) is usually an early indicator of the company's future earnings performance.The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio takes into account a company's revenues when valuing it. It is key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to manipulate sales numbers as they can with earnings.While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision-making, this in isolation doesn't indicate much about a company's future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits.So, consideration of a company's cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments. Also, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control, and sales are increasing faster than costs - an optimal situation for it. This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see  .Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Los Angeles, CA,  operates as a global investment management firm that focuses on alternative markets.

" continues to ramp up its security measures to enhance user safety and accessibility on its platform. Recently, the social media giant updated its reporting feature, which enables users to provide a detailed review of the tweet they choose to report.The company has faced backlash for its inability to protect user privacy on its platform. Notably, prior to this development, reporting a tweet or an account only worked for those accounts that violated Twitter's policies.On reporting a post, users will get to specify whether a particular tweet is offensive or is spreading personal information. If a user selects the second option, they can mention if the tweet reveals their contact information, place of residence, financial information or ID numbers among others.The new update will help Twitter to prioritize the reported tweets and accelerate the process of removing the ones containing personal information.

Notably, storing deleted messages undermines the brand's integrity and reputation and is a breach of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policies.Twitter is also facing civil proceedings in Russia for failing to comply with local data laws. Per reports, Moscow plans to impose huge fines on tech firms that disobey Russian laws.Twitter's current endeavors to regain user confidence cannot be overlooked. This along with enhanced features of its applications improves its near-term growth prospects.Apart from strengthening its reporting feature, Twitter announced that it will allow users to hide replies to their tweets. Notably, this ""moderation"" feature marks the company's effort to improve overall conversational health on its platform by helping users get rid of online trolls and abuse.Additionally, a plethora of new features are also expected to help Twitter in luring users. This will eventually attract advertisers, thereby driving top-line growth.The company is experimenting with a new design aimed at making the application more interactive for its users, which includes color-coded replies and Facebook-like status update. Further, another new feature enables users to see the most recent tweets first instead of the popular ones.Currently, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Symantec Corporation  and Synopsys, Inc.  .

" continues to aggressively invest in renewable energy for its operations. The company recently inked two power purchase agreements (PPA) with EDP Renewables North America LLC to work on a wind energy project based out of Paulding County, OH.The two new deals, each spread over 15-years, bring in a total 125-megawatt (MW) of wind energy to Microsoft's renewable portfolio, which is now estimated to have reached 1.4 gigawatts.The Timber Road IV Wind Farm project is anticipated to commence operations in 2019. The facility is estimated to create around 200 jobs in the course of construction. The wind farm is also expected to generate local state economic income of $1.1 million annually.EDP Renewables North America LLC, a subsidiary of EDP Renewables SA (EDPR) is primarily engaged in developing sustainable energy solutions which involves operating wind farms and solar parks across North America. Notably, the latest Timber Road IV Wind Farm marks EDPR's fourth wind farm project based in Ohio.Strength in EDPR's sustainable energy solutions favors the prospects of the deal. The latest contracts are in sync with Microsoft's strategy to promote the usage of renewable energy in a bid to keep operating expenses under control and reduce carbon emission.In fact, Microsoft intends to achieve early 60% dependency on renewable energy for its power requirements by the end of 2020. Notably, the company has set an ambitious target to fuel 100% of its global energy needs through renewable resources like solar, geothermal & wind power, biogas and hydro power.Coming to price performance, shares of Microsoft have returned 16.3% in the past year outperforming the  's rally of 14.2%.Cloud computing is gradually gaining traction among the masses, given the convenience and security features it provides to the end user. Per an IDC report, global public cloud services' spending is estimated to reach $370 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 22.5%. Per the report, public cloud services' spending is expected to reach $210 billion in 2019, up 23.8% over 2018.In order to operate a cloud infrastructure, data centers are required, which in turn need steady and unwavering power supply to function properly.Given the growing demand for cloud, demand for datacenters and power is likely to increase in the future. To meet the power requirements, many major cloud players are turning to renewable sources of energy and Microsoft is no exception to the trend.Microsoft is one of the many notable companies that are undertaking significant investments in renewable energy. In fact, reports suggest that Microsoft's cloud platform Azure ""has been carbon-neutral since 2012.""Moreover, the company has completed quite a few large-scale corporate PPAs to buy renewable energy. Notably, the Timber Road IV Wind Farm marks the company's fifth green energy focused venture in the larger PJM region in the United States.Further, the company recently entered into a 15-year PPA with Invenergy, by which it will be the single off-taker of the solar energy produced by Wilkinson Solar Energy Center.We note that dependence on renewable resources to cut down on operating costs is just another way to be more competitive and profitable, and Microsoft's decision to do so augurs well for the company in the long run.Other companies like Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Walmart, among others, are also seeking greater use of renewable energy in their operations. Notably, Apple and Alphabet owned Google have achieved 100% renewables target and are powered by green energy. Amazon Web Services (""AWS"") attained 50% dependency on renewable energy in January 2018, and has plans to hit the target of 100% in the longer haul.Going green initiatives by the big companies are expected to benefit overall environment with reduced global warming and fossil fuel consumption. Furthermore, the renewable project aids economic development of the states involved, which is like a cherry on the cake.Currently, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" recently announced collaboration with WekaIO in an effort to develop joint solution to offer high-performance cost-effective NVMe-based flash storage platform.WekaIO's flagship Matrix software will be integrated with Western Digital's ActiveScale object storage offering and NVMe platform portfolio. This combination is expected to deliver robust storage solutions to accelerate enterprise applications on cloud platforms.Reportedly, Matrix software offers ""the world's fastest parallel file system"", which strengthens the prospects of the alliance. Together with Western Digital's low-latency and high-performance NVMe platforms, the collaboration is well poised to deliver scalable and durable cloud storage solutions.Further, the companies aspire to provide cloud object storage solution with petabyte capacity to accelerate high performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) processes.Notably, Western Digital Capital, the company's investment arm, has made an investment in WekaIO for the project. The amount has been kept under wraps.We believe new initiatives to enhance its data center storage portfolio are likely to aid the company in reviving its fortunes and improve its competitive position against other storage players in the market. Notably, shares of Western Digital have returned 17.1% in the past three months, outperforming the  's rally of 11.8%.IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 175 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), from 33 zettabytes in 2018. This exponential growth of data bodes well for Western Digital's enterprise storage solutions due to growing demand for faster processing of data.Per ResearchAndMarkets data, the global data center storage market is projected to increase at a CAGR of 11.8% from 2018 through 2022. Per MarketsandMarkets report, the non-volatile memory market is projected to witness a CAGR of 9.5% to reach approximately $82 billion by 2022.The aforementioned reports reflect robust demand for NVMe cloud storage systems in data centers, which in turn strengthen the prospects of the to-be-developed collaborative solution.Western Digital has not been doing well financially, of late. Uncertain macroeconomic environment, declining trend in PC shipments and softness in NAND flash pricing trends are adversely impacting financial results. Ballooning debt levels add to the woes.In second-quarter fiscal 2019, Data center devices and solutions segment revenues plummeted 25.1% year over year to $1.074 billion, owing to weakness in end-market. Moreover, the figure was down 25.7% sequentially. | The new collaboration on data center storage is anticipated to perk up adoption rate of company's NVMe solutions, consequently aiding top-line performance in the longer haul.Western Digital currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" has announced that it is divesting its mobile communications business (FCI product line) to Dialog Semiconductor Plc. for $45 million. Depending on regulatory approvals and closing conditions, the transaction is anticipated to close by 2019.This product line comprises low power, multi-mode diversity LTE, mobile TV SoCs and battery-operated Wi-Fi products utilized in the Internet of Things (IoT). According to Wallace Kou, president and CEO of Silicon Motion, ""This sale paves the way for us to focus even more in our core SSD controllers and related solutions for client devices, as well as data center and enterprise applications.""Notably in the las  ed quarter (fourth-quarter 2018), Mobile communications product (which include mobile TV SoCs) sales were $7.2 million, representing 6% of total revenues, declining 23.4% year over year. Sales from mobile storage products (which include Embedded Storage as well as Expandable Storage products) declined 10% from the year-ago figure to $113.4 million. Revenues from mobile storage products contributed 92% to overall product revenues.Consequently, shifting focus on its Client SSD controllers segment and selling FCI product line will help the company in managing its business better.During the fourth quarter, the company shipped SSD controllers which are 96-layer TLC-based client SSDs to US NAND partner, which is a positive.Shares of Silicon Motion have lost 15.2% in the past one year, against the  's 3.9% rally.Silicon Motion delivered fourth-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 83 cents per American Depositary Share (""ADS""), surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.

The figure came almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $123 million.Silicon Motion outshines peers in providing resources for research and development. It develops affordable versions of TLC NAND flash as well as high-density 3D NAND. Moreover, Silicon Motion's robust liquidity position has enabled the company to undertake diligent capital deployment initiatives that supplement long-term growth.We also believe that an expanding product portfolio is a key catalyst.However, intensifying competition in the USB flash drive controller market remains a major headwind.Silicon Motioncarries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Cadence Design Systems, Inc  , Synopsys, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" delivered second-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of 34 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Notably, earnings also went up by 1 cent from the year-ago quarter. The figure also came ahead of management's guided range of 17-21 cents per share.The company reported revenues of $169.3 million, surging 3% from the year-ago quarter. The figure comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $162 million and also came above the higher end of management's guided range of $157-$161 million. The increase can primarily be attributed to growth in Services revenues and License revenues. Further, strong adoption of several cloud-based products remained a key catalyst.The company had adopted a new revenue recognition standard - ASC 606 - which came into effect from first-quarter fiscal 2019. | Per the new accounting standard, the company will now have three main segments namely License and subscription, Maintenance, and Services.License and subscription revenues increased 3% from the year-ago quarter to $87.1 million.

" recently provided an update on fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 outlook.The company now anticipates fourth-quarter revenues to be in the band of $1.279 billion to $1.375 billion, compared with prior range of $1.251-$1.403 billion. Notably, the change in the guided range reflects unchanged mid-point of $1.327 billion.Per the press release, management notes that it is revising the range of revenues, as it is skeptical of whether there will be an addition or reduction in inventory levels at its distributors.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.33 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 32.6%.Non-GAAP earnings per share have now been forecast in the range of $1.30-$1.49 per share, compared with the previous guided range of $1.26-$1.53. In this case as well, the change in the guided range reflects unchanged midpoint of $1.395 per share.Notably, in the past couple of months, analysts have become increasingly cautious on Microchip's financial performance with estimates moving south and no movement in the opposite direction.In fact, in the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earningsmoved down 10.9% to $1.31 per share. The consensus estimates indicate decline of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Microchip's CEO, Steve Sanghi believes that excluding further negative developments pertaining to trade war between the United States and China, ""the March 2019 quarter will mark the bottom of the current cycle for Microchip.""Coming to share price performance, Microchip stock has plunged 7.1% in the past year, compared with  's decline of 4.4%.The company provided no other updates on the remaining financial metrics. Per the previous guidance, management anticipated non-GAAP gross margin in the 61.2-61.8% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected at 25.8-26.5%, and operating margin is expected at 34.7-36%.Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter are expected between 123 and 133 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50 million.Microchip delivered third-quarter fiscal 2019 non-GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.57 per share. The figure was also above the higher end of management's guided range of $1.49-$1.64 per share and surged from $1.36 per shares reported in the year-ago quarter.The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, increasing 42.4% from the year-ago quarter to $1.416 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The figure also marginally outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.402 billion and was toward the higher end of management's guided range of $1.362-$1.438 billion. The company benefited from robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.Microchip's strength in microcontroller business holds promise in the longer haul. We believe the company is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi's growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyout is likely to expand Microchip's total addressable markets.However, management remains cautious over few emerging concerns. Increasing lead time, slim demand trends in ZTE and Bitcoin business domains are headwinds. Further, significant exposure to Asian markets amid imposition of tariff owing to trade war between the United States and China remains an overhang.Furthermore, unfavorable movement in exchange rates continue to adversely impact the top line of the company and undermine its growth potential to some extent.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: SNPS)Q1 2019 Feb. 20, 2019 , Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the Synopsys  for the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and then later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release.In addition we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in today's earnings press release financial supplement and 8-K.Also included in the financial supplement is detailed information around our long-term financial objective, our transition to ASC 606, and newly disclosed results by segment.All of these items plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition the prepared remarks will be posted at the site at the conclusion of the call.With that, I'll turn it over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. Q1 was an excellent start to the year. Revenue was a record $820 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.08 both above our target ranges. Strength was across all product groups including some large expanded renewals with cornerstone semiconductor companies. We are confident in our outlook for the year and are reaffirming our guidance.Please note that this is the first quarter we are reporting two segments: Semiconductor & System Design; and Software Integrity. In Semiconductor & System Design results exceeded plan with strength across the Board, augmented by timing of customer shipments.In Software Integrity revenue was right on plan and operating margin continued to move toward sustainable profitability as we build for the long-term in this high-growth space. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.Looking at the overall landscape solid demand for our solutions has continued into 2019, notwithstanding the somewhat increased uncertainty in the market. While the global narrative focuses on geopolitical realities, electronics companies continue to design evermore complex chips and devices at an unabated speed.One notable driver, of course, is artificial intelligence. The development and proliferation of AI-dedicated chips brings great potential for us as the number of customers and designs is growing quickly.Competition among AI-specific companies is fierce and indeed for anyone incorporating AI into their chips with an intense race to market and a broad set of competing architectures.In addition, we're seeing an escalation of the security challenges in highly interconnected systems, loaded with software. This is in part driven by the proliferation of data-intensive IoT devices and the emerging 5G connectivity standard among other applications.The power of AI and the risks of security breaches require attention for all the products we use everyday from cars to mobile phones to smartphones to medical devices. Synopsys provides key technology in the midst of this evolving picture. Our results and outlook are not in spite of these challenges, but rather because of them.Our innovation in technology has become even more valuable to our customers when the stakes are so high. This is evident throughout our business. Our penetration in new and growing AI chip companies has been excellent and this growth has been visible across our product groups.In EDA, our Fusion Technology and platform rollout is progressing well and reports show increasingly strong results. IP also continued on a positive path helped by a particularly strong competitive win rate as we deliver sophisticated building blocks in more and more difficult advanced nodes and challenging verticals.On top of this, our Software Integrity business continues to broaden its customer base and software security is increasingly recognized as a must-have in this era of product development. With that let me share some product highlights starting with EDA. At the leading edge of technology, we continue to see a steady push toward smaller geometries as Synopsys continues to be the pioneer and the relied-upon supplier for well over 90% of 12-nanometer and below designs all the way down to 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer research and development.A particularly noteworthy accomplishment was the tape-out of the industry's first chip using next-generation gate-all-around transistors. This highly advanced tapeout is the result of an extensive collaboration with Samsung, using a full Fusion design platform flow from synthesis to place and route to signoff.Even at the earliest stages of process development, our unique position at the roots of silicon helps advance the most difficult research. The latest example of this is the recently announced collaborations with LTAB and IMTAB, important industry innovators to drive modeling standards to 2-nanometer and beyond.Meanwhile our breakthrough Fusion design platform continue to make great strides and generated strong results in Q1. You may recall that in November we introduced not only our next-generation synthesizer Design Compiler, NXT but also a game-changing new product called Fusion Compiler.Fusion Compiler which is architected on a unified data model is the only system on the market that integrates synthesis and place and route and all the key elements of our Gold standard signoff technology. We accomplished this through a novel way of sharing code among the different functions, thus eliminating the need to move between tools. The value to the customer is better chip results such as size, speed and power in shorter and more predictable design times.After just one quarter on the market, we're seeing high initial demand and have rapidly grown the number of active customers including many of the top 10 SoC design houses. Fusion Compiler was also recognized with a World Electronics Achievement Award for Product of the Year. When we pioneered the Fusion concept our aspiration was to build a platform upon which we could roll out new differentiating capabilities for years to come. Stay tuned, as we deliver even more exciting advances over the next 12 months.Now to verification, where our platform vision and technology execution have yielded excellent business and market share growth. Increasing chip and system complexity, means, huge verification challenges in terms of both speed and time-to-market.In addition, the growing desire to run software on top of systems that are still in construction is taxing the state-of-the-art of simulation, emulation and prototyping. Synopsys is at the forefront of enabling this to happen across software simulation, emulation FPGA-based and virtual prototyping.Our Verification Continuum platform continues to drive excellent demand and competitive wins. This quarter we saw particularly strong growth in software-based verification at both traditional semiconductor companies and emerging system companies focused on their own in-house design.In emulation, revenue growth has been significant over the past two years, driven by a steadily expanding number of customers and average run rate. While hardware revenue is quite variable from period-to-period, driven by the timing and magnitude of specific orders, it's clear that strong industry demand continues.Our newly launched ZeBu Server 4 product, the fastest largest capacity emulator in the market is generating broad-based adoption by customers, designing storage, networking and AI chips as well as a large global systems powerhouse. Orders for our HAPS FPGA-based prototyping solution were strong, particularly in 5G and automotive verticals. We're also seeing very promising progress with virtual prototyping in the automotive vertical benefiting semiconductor Tier 1 and OEM customers.Verification is an example of a capability that works well on the cloud. While we've hosted tools on our own cloud for years, including our ZeBu emulation system, we're continuing to make good progress tuning our solutions for cloud optimization.Interest is high. We have many customers, who use their own or public clouds, some who are already working directly with us and many others in proof-of-concept stages to see what structures may best work for them.Now moving to our IP products. We continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth with strength across the board particularly in AI and automotive. Our AI related differentiation was readily apparent in Q1 with wins from several very notable AI start-ups. As an example, Israel's Habana Labs achieved first-pass silicon success on its high-performance AI processor SoC using our PCI Express 4.0 IP.In automotive, we had a number of major global wins, including AI automotive start-up FABU, which selected a broad portfolio of Synopsys automotive certified IP. Over the past 12 months, we licensed IP to more than 25 leading automotive semiconductor suppliers covering a range of applications such as autonomous driving, infotainment and connectivity gateways.Now to our Software Integrity Group, which provides products and services to address code quality and security vulnerabilities early in the software development of life cycle. Over the last five years, we've systematically scaled this business and expected to reach 10% of total Synopsys revenue for fiscal 2019.Our investments in this high-growth market also substantially diversify our customer base into verticals such as financial services and medical, expand our reach in automotive and increase our business with our well-established electronics customers.While the need for enhanced security measures has clearly increased, companies still struggle to develop effective strategies on how to get there given the immense scope of the challenge. One example is automotive, arguably one of the most vulnerable industries due to the heavy toll that breaches can cause.A recent survey of global automotive manufacturers and suppliers found that 84% of automotive professionals have concerns that their organization's cyber security practices are not keeping pace with evolving technologies and that most of them test less than half of the technology they develop for security vulnerabilities.Boosted by the acquisition of Black Duck, which was fully integrated in Q2 -- in Q1, we offer by far the most comprehensive portfolio of products and services in the market today to help companies solve these challenges and we're not standing still.We're on track this year to deliver our integrated Software Integrity Platform, which will enable both software developers and management to build essential security and quality checks into their software development life cycle. Stay tuned for an announcement soon.In closing, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent financial results and are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2019. Even with some caution around  s, electronics companies continue to invest in critical chip and system designs, as well as immense amounts of sophisticated software.We are confident in both our near-term execution and our long-term prospects given our position in the markets. We are committed and well on-track toward our mid- and long-term growth and margin expansion targets.With that, let me thank our customers for their business and our employees for their dedication and hard work in delivering yet another strong quarter. Trac, will now highlight the financial perspective. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a great start to the year. Our financial results net or exceeded our targets in all key metrics as we continue to execute well across the board.Beginning with this quarter, we are also initiating segmen  ing for Synopsys. The investments we made five years ago in Software Integrity has reached critical mass and grown to approximately 10% of sales. Reporting this segment separately, allows us to better highlight the strengths of the two businesses we're building within and beyond our traditional semiconductor vertical.Our increasingly diverse customer base and our strong product portfolio combined with our nearly 90% recurring revenue model, positions us well for success in periods of high demand as well as those of greater uncertainty. Reflecting this dynamic, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year.Before I begin with the first quarter results, I want to remind everyone that Synopsys adopted ASC topic 606, the new accounting standard for revenue recognition beginning in fiscal 2019. All results, I'll provide today will be under ASC 606. For a summary of these results as well as equivalent financial metrics under ASC 605, please refer to our financial supplement.Now to the numbers. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise specified. We generated total revenue of $820 million, a 7% increase over Q1 of last year, which included an extra week. Our growth reflects both strong demand and timing of customer shipments. Recall that ASC 606 treats additional quarterly revenue variability.Trailing 12-month revenue growth was strong across all product groups and geographies. These results reflect both the depth and breadth of our product portfolio, increasing diversity of our customer base and the impact of the investments we made to drive long-term growth. Our contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations or backlog at the end of the quarter totaled $4.3 billion.Turning to our segments. Semiconductor & System Design revenue was $738 million, up 5% year-over-year or just over 11% excluding the extra week in 2018. Software Integrity revenue grew 29% to $82 million reaching approximately 10% of total revenue in the first quarter. Software Integrity revenue for the trailing 12 months was $299 million reflecting a strong leadership position in the application security market.Moving to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $673 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $619 million. And consolidated non-GAAP operating margin was 24.5%. For the quarter, Semiconductor & System Design delivered an adjusted operating margin of 26.5% while Software Integrity delivered an adjusted operating margin of 6.8%.Certain operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and other expenses that are managed at the consolidated level have not been allocated to our segments. These items are further -- are described at further detail in our financial supplement. Operating margin will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to normal variability of revenue expenses.ASC 606 can further amplify this quarterly variance within a given year. For this reason I want to reiterate that we've managed the business with a strong emphasis on full year and multi-year performance. We are on track to achieve our margin objective for the year while driving toward our long-term goal of 26% in 2021 and higher 20s longer-term. To wrap up the income statement, GAAP earnings per share were $1.01, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.08.Turning to cash. Operating cash outflow was $144 million reflecting our typical payout of variable compensation in Q1. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $592 million and total debt of $542 million. Building on last year's significant share repurchases of $400 million, we repurchased $29 million of our stock in Q1. Since 2016, we've returned more than $1.2 billion to shareholders and expect buybacks to remain an important piece of our capital allocation strategy.Moving on to guidance. We remain confident in our outlook for the year and are reaffirming our annual targets. Our targets are based on ASC 606 revenue recognition rules. For the second quarter, we expect revenue between $810 million and $850 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $682 million and $708 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $620 million and $640 million; other income and expenses between 0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.71 to $0.79 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.07 to $1.12 per share. For 2019 the full year targets are: revenue of $3.29 billion to $3.34 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.76 billion and $2.79 billion; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $2.52 billion and $2.54 billion resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of just over 23.5%.Other income and expenses between minus $13 million and minus $9 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million; GAAP earnings of $3.19 to $3.32 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $4.20 to $4.27 per share; cash flow from operations of approximately $700 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $270 million which includes the buildout of our China facility, as well as the relocation of some Silicon Valley offices. We continue to expect CapEx to drop roughly in half in 2020.To wrap up, we executed very well in Q1 and we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year. Companywide, we are delivering a robust revenue growth and driving profitability toward our long-term margin objectives. Both of our operating segments performed well and our new segment reporting will provide investors with greater transparency into these results.Finally, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy investing in the business while continuing to return capital to our shareholders as we focus on driving sustainable long-term value. And with that I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Aart you mentioned a couple of times in your prepared remarks about the uncertain macro environment and a couple of questions on that. First is has anything changed from last quarter you reported? And secondly have you seen this uncertain macro impact your business in any way at this point, I guess particularly on the hardware side which might be more susceptible to that kind of pressure? -- Thanks Rich, good question. It's always difficult to say, if there's a big difference from one quarter to another because you have these quarters flow from one to the other in somewhat not distinct fashion. The way I would answer it, it has had no impact on our business.I do think -- I do see that some of the reports looking at the forward-look and the predictions for 2019 were a little softer than before but they are also now a little bit better informed. And so this pertains to really the chip volume business more than anything else so it doesn't really touch us as the design starts and the design difficulty have continued to grow.So as we have been in the past, while we are not immune completely to the ups and downs of the semiconductor industry, we are relatively touched lightly and we're actually typically a safe haven during those times. -- All right. I appreciate that. And then Trac lots of nice new disclosure. A couple of things; one the backlog which you gave the $4.3 billion is that something you're going to disclose more regularly? I've never heard you give a backlog number not at the end of the year. So just wondering, why give that now?And then should we expect to be getting the operating margins of the two business segments on a go-forward basis? Well, I'll bet you are now breaking out that Software Integrity for both revenue and presumably operating margins? -- Hi, Rich. On the first question on backlog, we thought it was important to highlight backlog starting this year because as part of the 606 transition, we will be including that and disclosing that in our 10-Q. So yes, you'll see that on a quarterly basis.With regards to the segment reporting, going forward as part of segment reporting, we will provide both revenue and operating margin for both those segments. -- Great. Definitely appreciate that disclosure. Keep up the good work. Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.And our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question, and thanks for all the new disclosures here. So just first kind of on the revenue line, I know you guys already gave out a guidance, but this is kind of the third-year straight, where you're talking about a 2H the celebration and that hasn't happened in the last couple of years. So I guess instead of me asking about the conservatism, what's kind of embedded in 2H in terms of the guidance? -- Well, Mitch, I think I wouldn't characterize it that way. We actually had a great start to the year with Q1 and given our outlook for Q2 it to us the -- balanced forecast than we entered the year. And frankly from that perspective, I'm feeling optimistic and more confident in the outlook that we have. That's why we reaffirmed the guidance for the full year. -- Got it. And then the second one is on the cash flows. If I heard that correctly, you said, that the CapEx should come down in half. Does that kind of give you an implied, like, I guess, $900 million plus in cash flow for 2020? -- Well, it's too early to guide on 2020 at this point. We just wanted to give you an indication that the CapEx spend for this year is unusually high because of the few items that we highlighted. -- Okay. Got it. And then just last one just on the Software Integrity margins. So I think there's kind of a bull case here where that's going to be higher than your corporate average long-term. Is there any reason why that wouldn't be the case if I look out five years or 10 years? -- Well, we don't want to draw out that far. I guess, let me abstract that first at the highest level. We are committed to 26% operating margins in 2021. We will be driving improvements across all areas both on -- in both segments and across all areas of the business, so you should see improvements there.At this point, we're pleased to start off the quarter with profitability in Software Integrity, but it's a new market for us, that's growing and we'll continue to invest in building out the Software Integrity platform as well as scaling up that business. So it will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. But I think long-term the trend that we've seen over the last five years should be -- should continue. -- Okay. Perfect. Great quarter, guys. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.And we go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thanks. Hi, guys. This is actually Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Thanks for taking my question. First one, there's been something on investors' minds today, I guess, since last night. Cadence announced a significant new win with a marquee North American semiconductor company. And so based on their description it has led to some investors concluding that that company that they mentioned last night may be Intel. Since Intel is your largest customer, do you have any comment on what's happening there? Any share shifts that you may be seeing? -- Well, we never comment about individual customers and Intel has definitely been a very good partner and customer to us. And in general, it sounds like both companies have done extremely well recently. And I hope that bodes well for the overall market. So, yes, we do compete in many places but at the same time our objectives are to do well and I think we just did that this quarter. -- Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then a quick follow-up. Was there any maybe buying behavior particularly in the emulation space that maybe drove some budget flush spending around the calendar year-end in December where you maybe saw some pull-forward of emulation purchases? -- No. We didn't see any of that. And a number of people have asked us that question also in the context of China and we didn't really see that. And so I think we're seeing Q1 as just a continuation of now quite a number of good quarters and -- of a business that is both diversified, well-balanced and growing well. -- Okay, all right. Thank you. -- You're welcome.We have a question from Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. First, I mean you have a very strong beat in Q1 revenue by $20 million almost EPS $0.10. I guess why the upside not flowing to yearly guidance both for revenue and EPS? -- Hello, Monika this is Trac. It's -- as I said earlier it's a good start for the year. The results were a combination of us executing very well and growing the business. Some of it is timing in terms of customer deliveries. So -- and frankly there's a lot of business left to book for the full year. We feel good about the outlook and it's nice to have the first half look pretty secure. -- Got it. And then I think last quarter or before that you did -- you said that you have a leadership position in emulation. Could you maybe say if that still holds true? -- Well, our emulation has done extremely well. And this is a domain that -- and this is I think good news for many that continues to grow well because the demand around very difficult problems for emulation as an acceleration to simulation is high.In addition Synopsys has focused on a special case that is extremely important, which is can you run software on hardware that doesn't quite exist yet, i.e. hardware that you mock up in an emulator and the answer is yes.And more and more customers report that that is absolutely crucial because more often than not when the product is ready, the software is not and you cannot go to market. And that is why our area has done particularly well. And while these numbers are not individually disclosed, we are certainly convinced that we are the market leader in this area. -- All right. Then Aart you'd provided some commentary regarding the verification usage in cloud but maybe could you talk about how ready you think Synopsys solutions are for usage in the cloud? Are you seeing interest from not -- not only from verification for other products as well? -- So, let me go backwards on the question. The answer is yes. There are a number of other tools that are also used in the cloud typically things that require or can benefit from big bursts of computation where a user may not want to buy their own computers just for the burst period.And so this type of tools tend to be optimized a little bit differently so that they can run more easily in a public cloud or various forms of private clouds.And so there's quite a bit of interest in that. I don't think that things are completely black and white though, meaning that there are a lot of practical issues that have to be overcome to make things run very well. And there are steady advances on making the various forms of software do that effectively so that customers can essentially have a more flexible spending on hardware when they want it. -- Thank you so much. -- You're welcome.Our next question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. -- Yes, good afternoon. I guess first Trac I was wondering if any of the strength you saw in the quarter was driven by concerns that maybe there would be a worsening of the trade war and some of the customers wanting to buy ahead of that? -- We haven't seen a change in behavior at having that affect our revenues. It's -- as I said, it's pretty balanced in terms of growth as well as to some -- to a lesser degree timing of customer contracts. -- Okay. And then maybe just a big picture question for Aart. How do you look at the EDA growth when you have a slowing of Moore's Law, but then you have an increasing of the use of new materials and technologies along the way? I mean unbalanced does that scenario provide growth for EDA or stability? How do you look at that? -- It almost feels like a question that you could have asked in 1997 and 2007 then again and I don't want to sidestep at all the fact that the complexity of Moore's Law is increasing. And the complexity itself is good for us, but with the complexity, of course, comes an economic equation that will over time bring some changes for customers.And so at this point in time though the demand for really advanced chips is quite strong. And that -- I have illuminated many times by saying that we have entered a whole new phase of what electronics can do in most products and actually in most verticals. And that is the age of condition or artificial intelligence where the early results, and they have to be called early because they're literally just three, four years old now, are very promising but the demand for dramatically more computation is unabated.And so I think the push will continue and the challenges that continue with it and I think for a company such as ourselves that's a good thing because that is our specialty. And by the way this reaches all the way down to the deep physics of Moore's Law where we do excellent business in providing simulation tools that allow to check out how a brand-new transistor such as let's say the gate-all-around type models will function before we even manufacture them. So, the food chain of Moore's Law is actually pretty long. -- But maybe just to bring the food chain down a little further -- or maybe up a little further. If you look at advanced packaging taking over some of the increases more than Moore's Law if you will, how does that benefit you from an EDA company? And is it meaningful? -- Excellent question because this is a question that has actually also has sort of ups and downs multiple times in the last couple of decades. Every time that there was sort of a hint that Moore's Law was coming to an abrupt end, the solution was well instead of putting things in one chip, let's put it into multiple chips, maybe stack those chips on top of each other. And the technologies have actually advanced substantially to make that possible, but they are not simple in their own right. Meaning that if you can still put it in one chip that is often easier both economically and technically.Having said that, yes, there is progress in various forms of packaging and stacking of chips. And we think that that will continue to grow over the years to come. And there too sophisticated EDA tools such as ours will be absolutely necessary to do that. So it sounds like these are very different things but from my perspective, it's just a continuation of whatever is the best method to deliver a lot of functionality electronically, we will be full-focused on. -- Okay, great. Thanks for your time. -- You're welcome.(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. -- Yeah. Thank you. Aart, let me start with you, regarding SIG and then a backlog question for Trac. So anticipation of the SIG platform that you've been alluding to, could you talk about what the customer behavior looks like thus far with regard to both the mix of SIG tools that they're buying and services engagements that you're providing or undertaking for SIG?So in the case of the product, for example, are customers buying multiple solutions? Are they buying not just Coverity, not just the Duck, but multiple products? And then, with regard to the services, would you regard those as leading coincident or lagging indicators for the SIG business? And might the platform perhaps mitigate how services-intensive that business might be and therefore help margins over time? -- Well, that's an -- it's an excellent question, because we of course entered this market as it was just coming about. It's a highly in-development market in many different point solutions. And we were fortunate enough to acquire, I believe, some of the very best ones.Why do I describe it in that fashion? Because if you're sitting on the user side, you may have specific problems for which you buy a very specific point tool and maybe happy with that. If you're sitting a little bit closer to the IT management of a company that has many users, this is a horror scenario, because now you have all these point tools from all these individual, often small companies, often companies that do not have a longevity in being able to support you, may disappear may get acquired.And so, we noticed already now, I would say, a couple of years ago that a number of companies were positively surprised when they found out that, of some of the point tools we had acquired, behind that was a company like Synopsys that was actually substantial, had a long history and therefore was probably stable.If you now amend that by the fact that a platform really is a mechanism to bring multiple point tools together to make them look and feel the same, be able to share data between the tools, have reports that can both work for the individual user, but also for the management to get good overview, you can see how at a minimum this brings a simplification for the people that have to manage the utilization of all of this in large companies, often companies where their core competence is not the software, but they're highly dependent on some piece or some sets of software that needs to be secured in high-quality.In that context, the service question is extremely appropriate. And we have said, when we acquired it that initially it would give us access to precisely the higher-level management that needed help in plotting their strategies on how to go about security strategy around the software. And in that sense, that would be in your leading category.Meanwhile, there's a number of services that we provide where on a regular basis, we do certain checks for customers that would be in the coincidental category. And then if there are issues that pop up at a customer that only they don't know what to do there that would be lagging, but we certainly can provide help in a situation where suddenly an urgency comes up.So maybe summarizing this somewhat long monologue here is that we have a number of puzzle pieces that are now being put together and out of that I think comes both a stronger position for us a more effective utilization on the part of the customer and the opportunity to continually add incremental value to the platform. -- For Trac you grew your backlog -- and thank you for that Aart. That was good explanation. For Trac you grew your backlog a quarter by the amount that you grew your backlog for all of fiscal 2018 about $300 million. So assuming the usual three-year runoff or conversion that isn't translating into any incremental revenues relative to guidance for this year? -- Look Jay we don't want to comment on how to extrapolate the backlog. We're going to disclose that so you will see that trend over time. But given that we will have different contracts renew at different points in time I think it's too -- it would be too difficult to really translate to -- that to the health of the business. Overall, I think we'll continue to refer you back to run rate growth in the business and look at the -- that trend. And that tends to be -- that has been up. -- Thank you. -- Thank you, Jay.We have a question from Joshua Tilton with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Have you seen increased stickiness with customers as the Fusion offering integrates many steps of the design flow that may have been accomplished with numerous products in the past? -- It is too early to be able to check on stickiness because that is by definition something over a long period of time. But the expectation would be absolutely yes, meaning that, one of the key reasons customers will use this is because on a number of cases they will get better results, they will get the better results in a more predictable fashion and in a shorter amount of time. And so in that sense, it's really a continuation of our objectives for the last 30 years, which is provide better and better tools for more and more difficult chips. And so the early adoption has been very positive. We are maturing things rapidly. We're adding already new capabilities some of those will be announced in the not-too-distant future. And so it is definitely at the core of our platform for the next decade. -- Thanks. And then second question what is Software Integrity's current exposure to auto? And then how big is the potential auto's had for Software Integrity? -- I don't know the exact number, but I can tell you that we've had a number of very exciting automotive not only interactions but actually substantial business closures. And just to give a little color to that, in some cases, they have been connected somewhat to the rest of our business as we have moved into automotive. But in a number of cases, it's also that the automotive field has discovered, so to speak, that software is a major issue. And when I say the automotive industry I mean the OEMs, so the actual car manufacturers.And this is interesting from a different perspective. They have in the last 100 years or so relied on an enormously complex supplier chain. And now suddenly the concerns are directly at their door, because if they move into adding way more software and already the advanced cars have about 100 million lines of code, way more software in order to do autonomous driving or any other form of assisted driving, the risk of vulnerability is actually very, very costly.And so we have a number of customers that have now done large deals with us. We expect those to continue to grow over time. And interestingly enough, as we're coming via the Software Integrity Group sort of down from the software, we're moving up from the hardware with the various forms of virtual prototyping, and this is exactly part of the strategic picture that we have seen now for a number of years, which is this pincer movement around everything is sitting on the intersection of hardware and software. And that's where the value will be created. -- Thank you very much. -- Thank you.And I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing comments. -- Well, with that, thank you very much for attending this call. We completed a strong first quarter in the year and thus have renewed confidence in the rest of the year. And we're, as usual, thankful for both your questions and your attention to our company. Have a good rest of the afternoon.Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today.

teady sales growth is vital to the survival of any business. Sales growth not only offers an insight into product demand and pricing power, it also is important for growth projections and strategic decision making.Nonetheless, investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric. This might be because of investors' preconceived notion that a company's stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum.But investors must look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise. This is because in cases where companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company's future performance.Further, investors should make sure that sales are not only increasing but the growth rate is rising as well. Sales growth rate for the current year should exceed the prior year's growth.Therefore, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation. This metric's importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues, unlike earnings.However, a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits. Hence, considering a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs - an optimal situation for it. This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see  .Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening: provides electronic design automation software products used to design and test integrated circuits.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (Symbol: SPYG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $39.49 per unit.With SPYG trading at a recent price near $34.96 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.97% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPYG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), Total System Services, Inc. (Symbol: TSS), and United Parcel Service Inc (Symbol: UPS). Although SNPS has traded at a recent price of $98.45/share, the average analyst target is 13.47% higher at $111.71/share. Similarly, TSS has 13.32% upside from the recent share price of $90.84 if the average analyst target price of $102.94/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting UPS to reach a target price of $122.12/share, which is 13.14% above the recent price of $107.94. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SNPS, TSS, and UPS:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Forecast 13% Upside For The Holdings of SPYG@2019-02-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-forecast-13-upside-holdings-spyg-2019-02-08
 is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 20.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four reported quarters and matched it twice, the average beat being 3.32%.In the las  ed quarter, the company's bottom and top-line figures met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results marked a year-over-year improvement.For the fiscal first quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the $775-$810 million range. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected within 95 cents to a penny.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings per share is pegged at $796.7 million and 97 cents, respectively.Let's see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Synopsys is gaining traction from a solid uptick across all product groups and geographies. Its sustained focus on introducing products, acquisitions and deal wins is likely to continue boosting results.Robust trends in the core electronic design automation (EDA) market, driven by a consistent chip and system complexity, is a positive. The company's digital design tools, aided by a strong performance across its Fusion design platform, are helping it generate solid revenue growth.Demand for Synopsys' hardware-based Zebu emulation system is also encouraging. Also, sturdy growth in both the IP and Software Integrity segments is setting the stage for further expansion. The company is looking into both organic investments and key buyouts to diversify its customer base, thus expanding its total addressable market.Management noted that the company's purchases of Cigital and Black Duck are establishing tactical quality relations with clients, leading to higher demand creation, cross-selling and a substantial rise in brand recognition.However, U.S.-China trade tensions and slowing smartphone demand are a major threat to semiconductor market, which makes us grow anxious about Synopsys's near-term results.Further, increasing costs and expenses are an overhang on the company's margins. Additionally, a rising competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.  is another concern. | Our proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  . Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Synopsys currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some stocks, which you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the upcoming releases:GTT Communications, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +173.53% and a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see  .Ciena Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #3.Here's another stock idea to consider.

Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

all Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Synopsys (SNPS) reports results for the quarter ended January 2019. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of software used to test and develop chips is expected to pos  of $0.97 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.8%.Revenues are expected to be $796.68 million, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Synopsys, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synopsys will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Synopsys would pos  of $0.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Synopsys doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The introduction of EUV and non-EUV projects at the 7-nanometer node in the mask shops is also driving the momentum.Further, the company is witnessing significant adoption of its recently introduced products, including the Voyager laser scanning pattern inspection and the SP7 bare wafer inspection platforms.However, 10-15% lower shipment in China was an overhang. This is expected to persist throughout the year.KLA's non-GAAP gross margin came in 40 basis points lower than the midpoint of guidance at 63.6%, as improvement in product mix was offset by higher manufacturing and service costs.Total operating expenses were $275 million and in line with the midpoint of its guidance.During the quarter, $115 million was paid in the form of regular and quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stocks, and $250 million of common stock was repurchased.KLA ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and a marketable securities balance of $2.69 billion compared with $2.78 billion in the las  ed quarter.Cash from operations was $282.2 million, lower than $381.4 million in the last reported quarter.For third-quarter fiscal 2019, KLA expects shipments within $860-$940 million. Revenues are expected between $880 million and $960 million, down from the company's projection in the first fiscal quarter. The memory shipment pull-ins from the third fiscal quarter, together with delays in certain shipments, led to the view cut.Memory is expected to be approximately 40% of shipments in the fiscal third quarter. Foundry should be about 50% and Logic is expected to be around 10% of the total shipments in the quarter.The company expects non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 61-62%.

" recently announced that it is stepping up its expansive efforts in Ireland with a new building - the Salesforce Tower in Dublin - a 430,000 square foot campus of four interconnected buildings. The company also stated its intentions to open 1,500 employment opportunities locally over the course of the next five years.Further, highlighting Salesforce's efforts in Ireland was the $1 million grant to Educate Together, announced by Salesforce.org - the company's philanthropic subsidiary. This grant will be used to build and run 84 primary and 13 second-level schools in Ireland, providing education to more than 28,000 students. Notably, this is said to be Salesforce's largest European grant to date.The announcements were made with the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, in the presence of about 1,000 employees.Salesforce currently has more than 1,400 employees in Dublin. The addition of 1,500 employees will be across all functions including engineering, customer support, sales and business services.Miguel Milano, President, International, Salesforce, said, ""Europe is Salesforce's fastest growing region, and Ireland has been a significant part of our success. We are excited to be announcing our continued commitment with this investment in Dublin as we grow our team in the coming years.""Salesforce's expansive efforts in Europe are long documented. Over the past few years, it has invested in several start-ups, through both acquisitions and partnerships. In Europe, the company opened its first data center in the U.K. in August 2014.In 2015, Salesforce opened two more datacenters, one each in France and Germany, which helped it reach local small and medium businesses as well as government agencies. In the same year, the company's investment arm, Salesforce Ventures, invested $100 million specifically in European start-ups.Last April, Salesforce announced an investment of $2.2 billion in its French business over the next five years. Further, in June last year, it announced its plan to spend $2.5 billion to boost sales in the U.K. - its largest European market - over the next five years.The main intent behind the company's endeavours in Ireland (Europe in general) might be the fact that its home market in the United States has hit a saturation point leading to slower growth of its cloud software. On the other hand, the company continues to win customers in the international market, which in turn, is helping it deliver strong growth internationally.We believe expansion in Europe would enable the company to diversify its international revenues, going forward.Notably, in the las  ed quarter, revenue from Americas grew 25% while Europe grew 31% and Asia Pacific grew 26%. However, Americas still accounts for 72% of total revenue while Europe and Asia Pacific account for 18% and 10%, respectively. Therefore, there is still a lot of room for Salesforce's growth in the international quarters. | Salesforce currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Twitter, Inc.  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 is riding on organic revenue growth and expanding margins. Continuous deal wins and rise in contract funding from federal customers are key growth drivers.Shares of the company have returned an average of 10.6% against the  's decline of 11.3%.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four reported quarters, the average positive surprise being 30.01%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and market cap of $3.85 billion, investors need to consider retaining it in their portfolio for long-term gains.Let's delve deeper and analyze the stock's prospects.CACI International is focused on the federal government marketplace and seeks to capture more market share. The company intends to drive operational excellence through its organic and inorganic growth strategy and strengthening existing customer relationships while building newer ones.The company has been doing well and won a number of awards, which reflects its disciplined business development actions, consistent operational excellence and high customer satisfaction.The company has a large pipeline of new projects and continues to win more deals at regular intervals, which is driving its top line. Its strategy of winning high-value contracts, delivering excellence to customers and deploying capital for growth is expected to help it achieve newer heights.CACI International's buyout of the Systems Engineering and Acquisition Support Services Business Unit of CSRA LLC in the las  ed quarter strengthened its relationship with the U.S. Navy. The acquisition encouraged a raise in fiscal 2019 revenue and earnings guidance.In addition, the company's cost-reduction program is helping it boost its operating income. This makes us positive about the company's near-term prospects.However, macroeconomic challenges, foreign currency volatility and regulatory pressure remain potential headwinds for the company.Moreover, CACI International generates revenues from contracts and task orders awarded through a competitive bidding process. These contracts contain provisions permitting a government client to terminate them for convenience. A decision to terminate active contracts is likely to result in significant revenue shortfall for the company.CACI International currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some top-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Twitter, Inc.  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The bottom line also improved from the year-ago quarter figure of 65 cents.Net sales of $864 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $863 million and rose 6.4% year over year.

 prudent investment decision involves buying of stocks with solid prospects and selling those that carry a lot of risks. At times, it is rational to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on  , a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.95%. The metric is expected to register growth of 7.8% and 7.9% in 2019 and 2020, respectively.The company's price performance over the past year looks impressive. Shares of Infosys have rallied 16.7% versus the  's decline of 12.1%.Let's delve deeper and analyze the stock's prospects.Infosys is benefiting from growth across geographies and business segments. In the las  ed quarter, adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues of $2.99 billion increased 8.4% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.95 billion on the back of strong demand in digital services.Higher spending on digital, analytics, cloud, cybersecurity and other new technology domains is a key driver for the company. It benefited from a strong performance within the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) verticals.Large deal wins are a positive for the company. In the last reported quarter, it signed 14 big contracts with a total contract value (TCV) of more than $1.57 billion, mainly from financial services and manufacturing verticals. Higher investment in sales and focus on building a client-supportive portfolio are an upside.The company added 101 clients, partly backed by the Fluido acquisition. Good news is that its number of $100 million-plus clients is now reportedly increased to 23 compared with 20 a year ago.The aforementioned factors left a positive influence on Infosys' performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company's key metrics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four reported quarters, matching it on one occasion. The average positive surprise is delivered at 4.92%.Given robust demand for its core services and latest digital offerings, the company raised its revenue guidance for the current fiscal year. Revenues are expected to rise in the 8.5-9% range compared with the earlier projection of 6-8% at CC.We believe, the upbeat results will continue in the forthcoming quarters, providing investors with enough reasons to keep the stock in their portfolio. | Currently, Infosys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Cloudera  and Verint Systems Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Chicago, IL - January 22, 2019- Stocks in this week's article include Carlisle Companies Inc.  , Berry Global Group, Inc.  , Synopsys, Inc.  , VMware, Inc.  and Alaska Air Group, Inc.  . Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their 'first' profit and explains why they are ones to watch.Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales generally get converted into growth.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles for the company and offers lower scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without impressive revenue growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires robust sales growth.But sales growth alone can't indicate much about a company's future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits.So, taking into consideration a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

trong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales generally get converted into growth.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business.

Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs - an optimal situation for it. This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options become available this week, for the September 20th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new September 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $83.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $90.64/share today.Because the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"icron  recently announced that it has exercised its call option to acquire Intel's  49% stake in IM Flash Technologies, a joint venture of both companies. The buyout has been settled at $1.5 billion and is expected to close within the next six to twelve months.Per mutual agreements, Intel will buy 3D XPoint memory wafers from Micron for up to a year after the deal closes, post which, IM Flash will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Micron.Micron tied up with Intel to develop new memory technologies back in 2006, thus forming IM Flash Technologies. In 2015, this collaboration yielded the 3D XPoint technology, which is widely used in high-end computers and data centers. Based on this technology, Intel launched Optane, its NVM (non-volatile memory) product.Micron's intention to take over the joint venture was announced last October. The deal will enable Micron to ramp up 3-D Xpoint production and give the company full flexibility to innovate on the technology and develop next-generation tech tools.Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO, Micron Technology, was quoted saying, ""The IM Flash acquisition will enable Micron to accelerate our R&D and optimize our manufacturing plan for 3D XPoint…""The company stated that the transaction will not have any significant impact on its non-GAAP results or capital expenditure expectations. This is because the purchase has already been included in the company's most recent financial statements.Morever, the deal will eliminate IM Flash's member debt ($1 billion as of Nov 29, 2018) from Micron's balance sheet. As of Nov 29, 2018, Micron's long-term debt was $3.73 billion, down from $3.78 billion sequentially.Moreover, the company informed that the 1,700 strong workforce of IM Flash is not likely to be affected by this strategic move.Micron has a strong cash flow generating ability, which helps it make strategic acquisitions and invest in new products. The company generated approximately $17.4 billion of cash flow from operational activities in fiscal 2018. Micron had exited the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with almost $8 billion in revenues and $5.563 billion cash and short-term investments.However, in the las  ed quarter, revenues from the Storage Business Unit (SBU) comprising SSD NAND components and 3D XPoint summed $1.14 billion, down 17% on a year-over-year basis and 8% sequentially, owing to low pricing and the ongoing transition from SATA to NVMe SSDs. It remains to be seen whether the purchase of IM Flash can revive the fortunes of this particular business segment. | Micron currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) while Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Two better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 is in talks to acquire U.S.-Israeli software developer ClickSoftware Technologies for around $1.5 billion, reports Israeli newspaper  .ClickSoftware is a provider of automated mobile workforce management and service optimization solutions.Founded in 1979, ClickSoftware was last acquired in 2015 by San Francisco-based equity firm Francisco Partners for $438 million. Delisted from Nasdaq, the company went private post completion of the deal.Notably, acquisition activity has always been one of Salesforce's key growth strategies. The company is eyeing acquisitions to boost its capabilities and capture newer and larger market sharesSalesforce was on acquisition spree in 2016 when it bought 12 companies. After an extended hiatus on the buyout front in 2017 (just one - Sequence), the company spent a significant amount on the same last year.Last July, Salesforce purchased Israel-based artificial intelligence marketing platform, Datorama, for $850 million.Additionally, the transaction of MuleSoft for a consideration of $6.5 billion last March - the company's biggest ever takeover - is considered a major upside.Notably, in the las  ed quarter, MuleSoft's revenues surged 35% to $105 million. Salesforce's Platform and other revenues soared 51% to $742 million. Excluding Mulesoft, the same grew 30%. For fiscal 2019, the company expects approximately $375 million of contribution from MuleSoft.The company is also witnessing strong returns from its consolidations of CloudCraze (March 2018), which is helping it utilize the growing opportunities in the B2B commerce industry.Last January, Salesforce acquired Attic Labs to enhance its Quip division back-end capabilities. Notably, the integration of document-collaboration platform Quip in 2016, which has clients like Apple, Amazon and Citibank, is a big boon to the company.Moreover, last October, the company entered into an agreement to buy interactive email service provider, Rebel, for expanding its Marketing and Commerce Cloud abilities.Salesforce's sustained focus on broadening its business base through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run, in our view. | Currently, Salesforce has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"icron Technology  recently announced that it is partnering with Qualcomm Incorporated  subsidiary - Qualcomm Technologies - to jointly develop advanced solutions for in-vehicle cockpit controls in autonomous vehicles.Micron's automotive-grade LPDDR4X memory devices will be used to build the next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platforms. Micron's memory solutions will also be tested to be integrated into the cockpit platforms to enhance customer experience.The Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platforms will be demonstrated during the ongoing Consumer Electronic Show 2019, which will end on Jan 11.Shyam Krishnamurthy, senior director of product management, Qualcomm Technologies was quoted saying ""Today's advanced automotive cockpit compute solutions must have greater compute performance and faster data throughput than ever before.""The system capacity of Micron's LPDDR4X memory devices ranges between 2 gigabytes (Gb) and 16 Gb with throughput rates of up to 546 Gb per second to support high-resolution 3D graphic displays. The memory devices also provide the bandwidth necessary to operate the compute-intensive platforms ideal for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).Memory and storage are key components of next-generation systems in autonomous vehicles, including ADAS technology. Micron offers memory products including DRAM, NAND, LPDDR and SSD, all of which are important to build a memory-hungry autonomous vehicle.This is the second partnership this year where Micron's memory solutions are being tested for self-drive vehicle's technologies. Recently, the company announced its partnership with Mobileye, as part of which, its LPDRAM, Xccela NOR Flash and e.MMC memory solutions will be tested to expedite the development of ADAS capabilities in Level 1-5 self-driving vehicles.The company already provides automotive-grade low-power DDR memories to automotive companies, which, Micron believes, will enable overall system bandwidths of up to 100 Gb per second. However, the company estimates that bandwidths of 300 Gb/s will be required to power Level 5 autonomous vehicles, making it all the more important to make advancements in its already powerful memory solutions.In November last year, the company launched the Micron 2100 series of 1TB automotive and industrial grade PCIe NVMe solid state drive, based on the 3D NAND technology. This will enable faster, more cost-effective and powerful storage solutions for level 3 or higher autonomous cars and industrial Internet of Things.In the same month, Micron also announced that it has entered into partnership with BMW Group to enhance automotive memory solutions for self-driven cars.Micron's recent string of announcements prove that the company is upping its efforts in the emerging market for self-drive autonomous vehicles, as the automotive industry is moving toward level 5 autonomy.We note that Micron, which is currently hit by excess inventory with customers in the cloud, graphics and enterprise market, continues to witness solid growth in automotive market. Management believes that rising demand for in-vehicle infotainment and ADAS will steadily fuel growth for the company.We therefore expect that given the strong growth opportunity of the autonomous vehicle market, the company's demand environment will improve and, in turn, aid this stock. | While Micron currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Qualcomm carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  and Synopsys, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy).

"fter a disappointing 2018, Wall Street has been gaining momentum steadily in the New Year. U.S. stock markets have commenced 2019 on a brighter note. The technology sector, which bore the brunt of market volatility in 2018, is also gradually recovering in 2019.Positive development on the trade war front, financial stimulus by the Chinese authorities to stabilize its economy and massive product innovations will act as near-term catalysts for the technology sector's revival. Consequently, it will be prudent to invest in technology stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.The technology sector suffered severe setback in 2018. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), one of the 11 sectors of the S&P 500, declined 2.9% last year. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.9% in 2018. However, in 2019 so far, XLK and Nasdaq Composite are up 3.1% and 5.9%, respectively.Notably, on Jan 15, Netflix Inc.  raised its U.S. prices in the range of 13-18% effective immediately. This was the biggest price increase announced by the company in 12 years. Although high prices could alienate subscribers, the company is confident of retaining customers on the back of its high quality content. Netflix's positive business outlook has helped FAANG stocks rally significantly.The three-day meeting between mid-level delegations of the United States and Chins ended on a positive note on Jan 5, although broad-based solutions to tariff conflicts are yet to be reached. This meeting at least laid the foundation for further negotiations to forge a permanent deal in order to resolve the trade disputes between the two largest trading nations of the world. China has already provided assurance of importing ""a substantial amount"" of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services from the United States.In order to stabilize its economy, Chinese authorities are taking several initiatives. The People's Bank of China has decided to increase efforts to stimulate growth of the country's economy by improving credit availability for smaller companies. Moreover, the Chinese Ministry of Finance has pledged to cut taxes and augment infrastructure spending which will aid in bolstering market sentiments.A strong Chinese economy will be a boost for the U.S. technology companies as China is the largest market for high-tech products. Additionally, China also plays the role of low-cost supplier of inputs to the high-tech U.S. industries.The technology sector is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation environment. The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants, and Internet-of-Things (IoT), which have set the stage for robust growth. The United States is all set to witness massive deployment of 5G wireless networks in 2019.

n order to keep pace with the rising sophistication of cyber threats,  has added new features to the FireEye Email Security - Server Edition.The new capabilities include Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine, which can use image-set passwords in emails to analyze the related password-protected files - a feature which most sandbox detection are unable to analyze.FireEye's MalwareGuard, which has been launched recently, is also among the new additions to the FireEye Email Security - Server Edition.The key intent behind the new upgrades is the growing incidences of executive impersonation attacks, which do not contain any malware but significantly jeopardize business emails. This is becoming a concern because people tend to access and respond to such emails because these look official and legitimate.Currently, spear-phishing emails is the first step of most of the cyber-attacks. In the FireEye Email Threat Report, the company found that 19% of all malware-less attacks were from executive impersonation emails. These triggered FireEye to device new techniques to detect and prevent email threats while maintaining its speed of about 14,000 detected malicious emails per customer per month, which bypass other email security tools.FireEye is gaining customer accounts, which are driving revenue growth. Innovation in its Network and Email Security products is boosting adoption of cloud and virtual appliances, as reflected in the growing number of new and renewal customers.In the las  ed quarter, the company's product and related subscription, and support revenues rose 4.2% to $127 million, driven by growth in virtual deployments and Cloud MVX. Moreover, the company also added 243 new logo customers in the third quarter, particularly from certain areas like Email Security.FireEye has been making significant progress on the back of its powerful technology MVX engine, through which it delivers differentiated security offerings. These include a proprietary hypervisor that offers real-time analysis of sophisticated malware threats along with zero-day and advanced persistent threat attacks, to its customers.Notably, in October last year, FireEye announced that its cloud-based email security solutions have received International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 certification, SOC 2 Type 2 recertification, and Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) reauthorization. | Cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement, given the growing exposure of enterprises to sophisticated cyber threats. While growing cyber-attacks don't bode well with most organizations, firms operating in the cybersecurity industry are positioned to benefit immensely. Enterprises are realizing the need for stricter security measures, which will push companies to further increase spending on cybersecurity.Recently, the United States issued an allocation of $15 billion for cybersecurity-related activities for 2019. Moreover, per MarketsandMarkets, the global cybersecurity market is expected to reach $248.3 billion by 2023, reflecting a CAGR of 10.2% through 2018 to 2023. These forecasts encourage us about FireEye's growth prospects in the space.FireEye currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Infineon Technologies AG  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" third-quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Revenues of $2.99 billion increased 8.4% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.95 billion. In terms of constant currency (CC), revenues were up 10.1%.Infosys' focus on Agile Digital and AI-driven Core services is a tailwind. The company is benefiting from growth across geographies and business segments. Large deal wins are a positive for the company. Higher spending on digital, analytics, cloud, cybersecurity and other new technology domains is a key driver for the company.Given robust demand for its core services and latest digital offerings, the company raised its revenue guidance for the current fiscal year.Digital Revenues (31.5% of total) surged 33.1% year over year to $942 million whereas Core Revenues (68.5%) marginally inched 0.4% up to $2.05 billion. Strong demand in cloud, IoT, cyber and data and analytics is a key driver.Geographically, on a sequential basis, North America, Europe, Rest of the World and India revenues rose 2.6%, 3.8%, 0.8% and 5.2%, respectively, at CC. On a year-over-year basis, North America and Europe grew 8.7% and 9.8% each.Segment wise, Manufacturing and Energy, Utilities, Resources & Services recorded highest sequential growth of 7.6% and 7.4%, respectively. Financial Services and Hi Tech rose 3.6% and 0.6%, respectively. Double-digit growth in Finacle is a key driver. However, slowdown in Europe especially in BFSI due to end-of-quarter furloughs has been a concern.Meanwhile, Retail and Communication slipped 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively. Sector-specific headwinds are an overhang on Communication sector while seasonal weaknesses kept Retail segment stressed. Life Science segment remained flat due to seasonal factor.On a year-over-year basis, Financial Services, Energy, Utilities, Resources & Services and Manufacturing increased 9.4%, 17.3% and 16.2%, all at CC.In the reported quarter, the company signed 14 large deals with a total contract value (TCV) of more than $1.57 billion, driven by higher investment in sales and focus on building a client-supportive portfolio. The company added 101 new clients, partly backed by Fluido acquisition.The company reported that its number of $100 million-plus clients is now 23 compared with 20 a year ago. | Gross profit increased 4.98% year over year to $1.03 billion. Gross margin contracted nearly 110 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 34.5%.The company's operating income increased 0.9% year over year to $695 million. However, operating margin declined 110 bps to 23.7%.Increase in compensation, drop in utilization, higher onsite mix, acquisitions and better sales investment were a threat to the margins.As of Dec 31, 2018, Infosys had cash and cash equivalents of $2,357 million compared with $2,462 million recorded in the previous quarter.Infosys lifted its revenue guidance for fiscal 2019. Revenues are expected to grow in the 8.5-9% range compared with the earlier projection of 6-8% at CC.Operating margin range is still anticipated to be between 22 and 24%.The company expects its operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter to be impacted by ""rupee appreciation, targeted communication correction, continued investment in business and initial margin impact to transition and impact of recently won deals.""Infosys currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Infineon Technologies AG  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for Synopsys, Infineon and Marvell is projected to be 10%, 8.62% and 9.38%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

 recently announced at the CES 2019 that it has signed a new metadata deal with Minerva Networks, wherein it will provide the metadata for Minerva YourTV Now, globally. Additionally, a multi-year intellectual property (IP) license renewal agreement has been signed between the companies.The new global metadata deal will enable Minerva to eliminate dependence on multiple metadata vendors and consolidate its metadata across its Minerva 10 platform. Minerva will be able to quickly access trending content and market the right content and enhance search results, among others, by using TiVo's metadata platform.Further, TiVo also announced a multi-year license deal with Mexican cable operator izzi Telecom for metadata for izzi Telecom video service, which will include a wider deployment of TiVo's Passport Guide for set-top boxes. This will enhance viewing experience of subscribers, who will be able to find and watch TV content more easily.TiVo's revenues from the Licensing, services and software division dropped 14.5% year over year in the las  ed quarter. IP Licensing revenues declined approximately 25.7% due to soft revenues from out-of-license settlements. Under the IP Licensing segment, revenues of the U.S. Pay TV Providers declined 30%.These apart, low revenues from the Legacy TiVo Time Warp IP deals led to a decline in the company's third-quarter revenues.The company is therefore banking on new agreements to turn around its fortunes. Continued license agreements and renewals bode well for it.In September last year, TiVo announced a multi-year license with Optiva Media to provide entertainment metadata, including TV schedules to the latter.Further, in November, TiVo announced the renewal of Foxtel's license to its Search and Recommendation Services. This was followed by its multi-year patent license agreement in December with Samsung for the use of Rovi's video discovery patents and technologies across Samsung's smartphone and tablet devices.We believe that such licensing agreements would be incrementally beneficial for the company. Additionally, the deals would provide the necessary competitive edge over its peers in the emerging market of online video streaming. | TiVo currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Infineon Technologies AG  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" unveiled the world's first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system - Drive AutoPilot - at the ongoing Customer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas.Per the company, Drive AutoPilot by ""integrating multiple breakthrough AI technologies"" will help automakers bring more advanced driving features into their self-driving vehicles.The platform is powered by NVDIA's Xavier system-on-a-chip processors and the latest Drive software for processing data from sensors outside the vehicle and inside the cabin.NVIDIA asserts that Drive AutoPilot will be able to address the limitations of existing Level 2 advanced driver assist systems (ADAS), which include ""inconsistent vehicle detections and poor ability to stay within lanes on curvy or hilly roads"", according to a recent study.Notably, the technology will add greater capabilities such as highway merge, lane change or lane split and personal mapping to the existing ADAS. Further, driver monitoring, AI copilot skills and sophisticated in-cabin visualization of the vehicle's computer vision system will be included.The chipmaker mentioned that Drive AutoPilot, a key component of the NVIDIA Drive platform, already has two customers. Notably, it will be used by German automotive suppliers, namely Continental and ZF in Level 2+ driverless systems with production beginning in 2020.NVIDIA's steady focus on developing more updated AI technologies for self-directed cars is making it well poised to become a leading provider of technology for autonomous vehicles. The company is already helming the market in this space, outclassing other competitors, such as Intel Corp.  and Advanced Micro Devices  in terms of growth.Per MarketsandMarkets, the ADAS market is projected to reach $91.83 billion by 2025, reflecting a CAGR of 20.96% between 2018 and 2025.According to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million automated cars will hit the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous modes of conveyance will be valued at roughly $6 billion while that of the partially autonomous ones will rake in $36 billion by 2025.Going by Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. These projections encourage us about NVIDIA's growth prospects in the space.Furthermore, by expanding its business avenues, the company will be able to curb its reliance on the PC industry, which is currently lying dormant. | Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the broader Computer and Technology sector is Synopsys, Inc.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

HP is leading the category into the future with beautifully designed devices that reflect personal style, incredibly immersive displays that bring computing to life in vivid detail, and next-level performance, versatility and security that empowers people to connect with confidence from anywhere, anytime"".HP introduced the world's first laptop with an AMOLED display - HP Spectre x360 15 - which will be instrumental in ""delivering an exceptional display to a dramatically redesigned premium PC"". The HP Spectre Folio is also available in Bordeaux Burgundy and with an optional 4K display.The company also unveiled HP Pavilion 27 Quantum Dot, the world's first Quantum Dot on glass display with more than a billion viewable colors.Additionally, the HP Pavilion 27 FHD brings forward a built-in B&O audio and a pop-up privacy camera. Moreover, the HP Pavilion 32 QHD offers a ""dynamic display with immersive QHD resolution and stunning vantage points from almost any angle.""Furthermore, HP unveiled complementary accessories including an ultra-slim HP ENVY USB-C Hub and HP 15.6 Odyssey Backpack.To cater to the growing security needs, HP launched the third-generation HP Sure View integrated privacy screen.

" recently announced that it has acquired Israel-based security technology provider, ForceNock Security Ltd for an undisclosed amount.The company believes that the growing usage of Cloud, Network, Mobile, Endpoint and IoT requires comprehensive yet powerful security technologies. To address this requirement, Check Point aims to integrate ForceNock's technology into its Infinity architecture, which provides effective protection from Gen V and succeeding generations of cyber-attacks. Infinity consolidates security in a platform, which encompasses the network, mobile and cloud.ForceNock, about a couple years old, uses machine learning-based, easily deployable security engine for Web Application and API (Application Program Interface) Protection, to eliminate the need of security teams to manage various complicated configurations while maximizing security. This makes it suitable for enhancing Check Point's Infinity architecture.Dorit Dor, Vice President of Products, Check Point said ""Incorporating ForceNock's technology into our Infinity Architecture will enable us to continue to provide the highest level of security for our customers worldwide and strengthens our machine learning protection capabilities.""Acquisitions have helped Check Point in broadening portfolio, capabilities and enter into newer market, which has eventually driven its revenues.In the last two decades, the company acquired 11 businesses to expedite growth. The notables among them were Lacoon Mobile Security, Hyperwise, Liquid Machines, Dynasec Ltd., and the security appliance business of Nokia Corporation.In the las  ed quarter, Check Point acquired Dome9, with which it expects to boost Infinity architecture and CloudGuard security offering.With the ForceNock buyout, the company will not only enhance its portfolio, but will also boost its Infinity sales strategy, which is currently one of its prime focuses.Though the terms of the deal were not disclosed, we believe that Check Point is comfortably positioned to make acquisitions.

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 15th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new February 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of 90 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $74.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $81.85/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 87%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $81.85/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.29% if the stock gets called away at the February 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

 recently announced at CES 2019 that its memory solutions have been selected by Mobileye to develop a system-on-chip (SoC)-based platform required for fully autonomous driving.Mobileye's fifth-generation EyeQ5 SoC-based EPM5 platform will function as the central sensor and performance control of its fully autonomous driving vehicles, which the company aims to release in 2020.As part of the collaboration, Micron's LPDRAM, Xccela NOR Flash and e.MMC memory solutions will be tested to expedite the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) capabilities in Level 1-5 self-driving vehicles.Memory and storage are key components of next-generation systems in autonomous vehicles, including ADAS technology. Micron offers memory products including DRAM, NAND, LPDDR and SSD, all of which are important to build a memory-hungry autonomous vehicle.Per MarketsandMarkets, the ADAS market is projected to reach $91.83 billion by 2025, reflecting a CAGR of 20.96% between 2018 and 2025.It seems that Micron is strategically placing itself to cash in on this opportunity. Its advanced data storage technology will help accelerate the race toward driverless car technology.The company's vehicle-focused semiconductor technology currently helps mitigate human driving errors like gesture control interfaces that help detect distracted drivers. Its artificial intelligence also helps cars detect the presence of objects and humans on the road and alert the driver.Moreover, Micron's vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology allows connected cars to communicate any information among themselves, for instance a blockage on the road, and helps them assess the situation and proactively slow down to avoid accidents.The company already provides automotive-grade low-power DDR memories to automotive companies. Micron believes that this will enable overall system bandwidths of up to 100 gigabytes per second. However, the company estimates that bandwidths of 300 GB/s will be required to power Level 5 autonomous vehicles, making it all the more important to make advancements in its already powerful memory solutions.In November last year, the company launched the Micron 2100 series of 1TB automotive and industrial grade PCIe NVMe solid state drive, based on the 3D NAND technology. This will enable faster, more cost-effective and powerful storage solutions for level 3 or higher autonomous cars and industrial Internet of Things.In the same month, Micron also announced that it has entered into partnership with BMW Group to enhance automotive memory solutions for self-driven cars.Micron's recent string of announcements prove that the company is upping its efforts in the emerging market for self-drive autonomous vehicles, as the automotive industry is moving toward level 5 autonomy.We note that Micron, which is currently hit by excess inventory with customers in the cloud, graphics and enterprise market, continues to witness solid growth in automotive market. Management believes that rising demand for in-vehicle infotainment and ADAS will steadily fuel growth for the company.We therefore expect that, given the strong projections of the autonomous vehicle market, the company's demand environment will improve and help pull up this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock. | Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Garmin Ltd.  , Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , and Synopsys, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy).

" has once again come under the scanner as investors have reportedly filed a class-action lawsuit against the company over misleading them regarding the collapse of its cryptocurrency business.The case filed by Schall Law Firm and Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP alleges that the company's unpreparedness related to the changing market environment has been a major setback.Moreover, the accuser cited that the company was ""untruthful"" regarding the status of its cryptocurrency business. Further it stated that investors were misguided into believing that the company would absorb diminishing crypto-related demand.A final decision regarding the class-action issue is to be made by a judge on Feb 19.Notably, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock is currently one of the worst performers, lagging the S&P 500 index and the industry it belongs to over the past year.Shares of NVIDIA have plunged 35.9% in the past year, underperforming the  12.9% decline and the S&P 500 Composite's 7.2% fall.The stock's market cap as of Jan 3 is $83.1 billion, down from more than $175 billion recorded in September-end.The chipmaker endured a bumpy ride in 2018 due to the end of the cryptocurrency mining boom, which weakened demand for its GPUs.NVIDIA was overly optimistic that demandfor its GPUs will shift from miners to gamers, which will boost the gaming business revenues and offset the revenue loss from miners. As a result, the company continued with its production of GeForce graphics cards.However, drawing proof from its last result, this has not been the case. The lower-than-expected top and bottom-line third-quarter fiscal 2019 results left the company tremendously stressed.Additionally, the company's bleak near-term guidance dealt a severe blow to investor confidence.

To address this growing concern, Symantec is taking initiatives to enhance its products. Integrated Cyber Defense Platform, which drives significant cross-sell and up-sell opportunities is a key driver.

Improvement in ARPU (average revenue per user) on the back of successful cross-sell, and better retention rate for its direct customer base are key positives.Symantec has also been actively taking up strategic partnerships to enhance its cyber security solutions. Recently it joined forces with Aon plc  to develop a solution to protect the assets of high-net-worth individuals against cyber hacking. This will also boost Symantec's Consumer Security segment, which builds on its Norton and Lifelock product portfolio.Moreover, its recent expansion of partnership with Fortinet  has strengthened its portfolio. The agglomeration of both the companies' technologies is expected to result in a comprehensive suite of stronger cloud-delivered cybercrime prevention solutions.

Continuous enhancement in MVX engine's product capabilities will further drive the company's top-line performance.Moreover, the company's focus on selling more subscription-based services has helped it witness tremendous customer growth.

With an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9% and a market cap of $8.9 billion, the stock seems to be a bet to reckon with for investors, who need to retain it in their portfolio if looking to reap long-term gains.Twilio's growing initiatives to further strengthen its foothold as a strategic software platform for customer engagement, and also to emerge as developers' first choice for communications are noteworthy.Being a provider of cloud communications platforms to corporations, Twilio is the missing link between businesses and the cloud. Additionally, as more and more companies are shifting gears tothe cloud, Twilio looks poised to ride the growth trend over the long run.The company is benefiting from its continued focus on introducing products and its go-to-market sales strategy.

Robust expansion within the existing customer base and also first-time deals with new clients make us optimistic about the company's growth prospects. Notably, in the last reported quarter, a number of Twilio Flex contracts signed lent a further impetus to the company's Engagement Cloud strategy.Moreover, in a bid to fortify its platform, Twilio has made a couple of selective acquisitions. With the latest acquisition of SendGrid, Twilio aims to strengthen its onmichannel communications capabilities by enhancing its Programmable Communications Cloud software, which allows developers to embed voice, messaging, video and authentication skills.Last September, the company bought its long-term business partner Ytica as part of efforts to improve its customer service application platform, Twilio Flex.

imilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in SLP.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 52 cents per share a month ago to its current level of 46 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Simulations Plus Industries has seen one downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 11 cents a share from 12 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 7.2% in the past month. | So, it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long-time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer - Software industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Synopsys, Inc.  .

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

 and other tech companies are in focus this week with the Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2019 running through this Friday. CES is a Las Vegas-based annual technology tradeshow conducted by the Consumer Technology Association annually in January At the event, NVIDIA unveiled its latest gaming GPU, GeForce RTX 2060, based on its Turing architecture. Priced at $349, RTX 2060 boasts ray tracing and AI capabilities.Although it has features, previously available only in high-end gaming GPUs, it is lower-priced compared to the same. Notably, the other Turing-based gaming GPUs, such as RTX 2080 Ti, 2080 and 2070, starts at $999, $699 and $499, respectively.NVIDIA believes that RTX 2060 capability to support 5 gigarays per second of ray-tracing (existing RTX GPUs support between 6 and 10 gigarays per second) is enough to offer an encouraging experience for leading gamers.Moreover, NVIDIA claims that the RTX 2060 will outperform its predecessor, the GTX 1060, which is based on Pascal architecture. The company asserts that it is 60% faster than the GTX 1060, and is also likely to beat the GTX 1070 Ti. However, performance comes with a high price tag as the RTX 2060 is 40% more expensive than the GTX 1060.Nonetheless, to make it more appealing, the company announced that with the purchase of RTX 2060 or RTX 2070, buyers will receive a free game - either  or  . With the purchase of a GeForce RTX 2080, both games will be available.The company also unveiled an array of gaming laptops based on GeForce RTX technology with more than 40 models from various manufacturers to be available on Jan 29.The tradeshow is highly important for the chipmaker, given the current pessimism it is hounded with. We note that in the las  ed quarter, the top line took a beating due to weak crypto-related demand.NVIDIA was overly optimistic that demand for its GPUs will shift from miners to gamers, which will boost the gaming business revenues and offset the revenue loss from miners. As a result, the company continued with its production of GeForce graphics cards. However, drawing proof from its last result, this has not been the case. The lower-than-expected top and bottom-line third-quarter fiscal 2019 results left the company tremendously stressed.However, we have seen the company's strong line-up of advanced graphics cards making it a favorite graphics card provider among PC makers.We feel that robust demand for PC gaming will be a tailwind to the company's financial performance. It has always generated substantial revenues from its cards because of significantly higher functionality.The company believes that the latest gaming GPUs will help it drive additional revenues. The new product menu is therefore expected to help the company re-instill investor confidence. | Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , eGain  and Verint Systems Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for both Synopsys and Verint is projected to be 10% while the same for eGain stands at 30%.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

The company's cloud-based video conferencing services are also a key growth driver.This apart, its acquired company Jaybird is helping Logitech expand its current product portfolio to address customers who prefer headphones over speakers, by constantly coming up with new products. Moreover, its recent acquisition of Blue Headphones is also expected to be a key growth driver.Additionally, Logitech has been making efforts to increase returns to its investors through share repurchases and dividend hikes.

 is set to acquire preconstruction software tools provider BuildingConnected for $275 million. The all cash deal is expected to close by Jan 31, 2019.The latest deal is in line with Autodesk's strategy to offer end-to-end construction management solution. The addition of BuildingConnected's bid management platform improves the company's visibility into new construction projects and bidding phase. Autodesk's customers can use the tools to save time and money.Moreover, BuildingConnected's network of more than 700,000 construction professionals' helps general contractors to find and hire qualified contractors for their projects. Further, the company offers TradeTapp, a subcontractor risk analysis platform, and Bid Board Pro, a platform that helps subcontractors manage and win more bids.The addition of these solutions expands and strengthens Autodesk's construction portfolio. The company's focus on connecting construction processes across designs, buildings and operations is a major long-term growth driver.BuildingConnected will be integrated into Autodesk's construction solutions team that includes Autodesk BIM 360, Revit, AutoCAD, PlanGrid and Assemble Systems. The deal will help Autodesk further penetrate the construction market, which is currently worth $10 billion.BuildingConnected is expected to have no material impact on fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. For fiscal 2020, Autodesk expects immaterial contribution from BuildingConnected toward annualized recurring revenues (ARR). However, it is expected to be slightly dilutive to profitability and cash flow.Notably, in the last reported quarter (third-quarter fiscal 2019), total ARR jumped 33% from the year-ago quarter to $2.53 billion. Cloud business ARR increased 36%, driven by robust BIM 360 sales that added 53,000 subscribers. Moreover, subscription plan ARR surged 108% year over year to $1.93 billion, driven by growth in enterprise business agreement (EBA). | For fiscal 2019, Autodesk maintained its earlier guidance for subscription additions of 500-550K. Total ARR growth is still expected to be 30-31%.Acquisitions like BuildingConnected,  and Assemble Systems expand Autodesk's portfolio.

his year has been quite volatile for the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite. While the index scaled new highs in June, it lost most of that gain by early December.The index was majorly impacted by the data privacy issues faced by behemoths like Facebook  , Alphabet's  Google, creating an environment of institutional sell-offs. The concern over data privacy called for increased regulation and strict monitoring of social media companies globally. Moreover, implementation of GDPR hurt growth in Europe.Further, growing U.S. protectionism, tariff imposition on Chinese imports and the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance related to interest rate hikes hurt the index.On Aug 31, the United States and Canada delayed their negotiations on trade issues, leading to a drop in the stock market as a whole. Despite this, tech stocks like Apple and Amazon helped the Nasdaq composite gain 0.26%.However, the technology sector was jolted by the United State's imposition over imports from China worth $250 billion ($50 billion in August & $200 billion in September) prompting a retaliatory tariff by China. The technology sector was hit the hardest, especially the chip stocks, as most of the demand came from China.Moreover, rising interest rates led to losses for major technology companies, pulling the Nasdaq composite to correction levels. The persistent decline in DRAM and NAND pricing due to oversupply and weaker-than-expected growth in end-market demand, is creating a havoc in the semiconductor market. Lack of demand from cryptocurrency miners further hurt chip stocks like NVIDIA.After going through a number of crests and troughs, by early December, the index lost what it gained through the year. Nonetheless, the composite has gained 2.8% year to date.This gain can be partly attributed to a few tech stocks that have withstood the volatility witnessed by the Nasdaq in 2018.Notably, rapid adoption of cloud computing, Internet of Things, wearables and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its tools have been fuelling growth in the sector.

In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I am pleased to report another excellent quarter and with it an outstanding year for Synopsys. In fiscal 2018 we crossed the $3 billion mark with revenue of $3.12 billion and delivered non-GAAP earnings-per-share of $3.91 -- both record results with strong double-digit growth. Our 3-year backlog grew by approximately $300 million to $4 billion. Our business was comprehensively strong with very good growth across all product groups and all geographies.We repurchased $400 million of our stock and simultaneously made targeted investments to drive long-term growth, both organically and through the acquisition of Black Duck. Our diversification into software security and quality progressed very well as we passed the quarter-billion-dollar annual revenue mark. Notwithstanding some turbulence in the market, Synopsys is in a strong position and we're increasing our long-term financial objectives. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.The actual fiscal 2018 results highlight a 5-year unparalleled period of technology innovation, market share growth, TAM expansion, and strong financial execution for Synopsys. Early on we envisioned a world of smart everything, where complex connected chips and systems combined with enormous software content would launch the age of AI-powered electronics. Our strategy flowed from there as we shifted our center of gravity to the critical intersection of hardware and software.Our investments were targeted at not only advanced EDA tools and platform but at broadening our mission-critical IP portfolio and entering a new business aimed at solving high-impact software security challenges. Our vision turned out to be en pointe and our execution puts us in an excellent position.As we look to our next phase of growth to $4 billion and beyond, our strategy is threefold: 1) sustain and grow our EDA and IT technology and market leadership, 2) continue to scale Software Integrity, driving substantial growth from a diverse customer base while steadily moving to solid profitability, and 3) further drive operational excellence toward multi-year operating margin expansion through continued revenue growth and prudent expense management.In that context, let me expand on each of these, beginning with EDA. Notwithstanding inevitable swings in the semiconductor market, EDA growth is driven by continued chip and system complexity. In 2018 we delivered a stream of innovations aimed squarely at enabling the most complex designs ever and those products are in the very stages of a multi-year upgrade cycle. Specifically, our digital design tools generated their highest revenue growth in several years, with strong performance across all elements of our new fusion design platform. The word fusion captures the advantages of a single or fused data model for synthesis, place-and-route, and signoff, enabling us to now share optimization engines across product boundaries.This results in very measurable productivity improvements for our customers. While we introduced the fusion concept in March, we formally launched the fusion design platform and two significant new products last month. Most notably, Fusion Compiler, the only single product on the market that integrates synthesis, place-and-route, and the key elements of our gold standard signoff technology. Built on a unified data model with shared code among the different functions, it eliminates the need to move between tools. Through a simultaneous multi-year development effort, we massively upgraded our synthesis capabilities with a brand-new engine built from the ground up resulting in notably higher capacity and performance.The combination is quite powerful with 2x faster times to results and significantly fewer design iterations, along with a 20% improvement in quality of results. These are impressive numbers. Customers such as Toshiba, Samsung, Socionext, and others have already reported excellent results and we see great promise for demand going forward. For customers who use our franchised design compiler products separately, we also launched a significant upgrade, Design Compiler NXT, which delivers 2x faster runtime and cloud-ready distributed synthesis that boosts performance even further. Stay tuned for more fusion-related capabilities to be rolled out during 2019.Verification 2 had another outstanding year of growth and share gains. With the exploding requirements of today's leading technology trends, including automotive, IoT, AI, and others, Verification is the biggest bottleneck for customers. We developed our Verification Continuum platform, which integrates the fastest market-leading hardware and software tools available to not only drive state-of-the-art chip verification but to enable the simulation of these highly complex systems.Across the board, we've generated a large number of competitive wins and have built significant new customer relationships. Particularly impactful has been our hardware-based ZeBu emulation system, which saw another record year making us the market leader. In 2018 we launched ZeBu Server 4, the fastest, largest capacity emulator available today. It hits the sweet spot of not only accelerating chip verification but importantly, early software bring-up and system validation. Customer success has been quite broad-based, from very large big volume semi and systems companies all the way to small aggressive AI start-ups.Emulation's an area that lends itself to delivery on the cloud, which is helpful to some customers as they seek sufficient computer capacity during periods of peak utilization. While we have offered cloud hosting for EDA tools for many years, we officially launched a broader cloud solution in the summer, partnering with public cloud providers, including Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Google, and Alibaba Cloud. We expect a continued growth in complexity will sustain strong demand for our solutions.Turning to semiconductor IP, we had another excellent year of double-digit growth, reaching record levels of slightly more than 20% of total Synopsys revenue. Over the past 15-plus years, we've built the broadest and highest quality portfolio of logic libraries, embedded memories, interfaces, processors, and security IP. Our offering has evolved from being initially cost-effective building blocks to now state-of-the-art sophisticated subsystems serving high-impact markets and leading-edge customers. Nowhere is this more visible than in cutting-edge verticals like cloud, AI, 5G, and autonomous driving.Our art processes, for example, generated very good growth in 2018, notably with our innovative embedded vision processor targeted at AI applications including drones, surveillance, and digital imaging products. Today's automotive chips must meet stringent functional safety and reliability standards. Over the past several years, we've developed the broadest portfolio of ISO 26262 certified IP for ADAS, infotainment, imbedded micro-controls, and more. Our unmatched portfolio of IP interfaces ranges from USB to PCI express to DVR, HDMI, MIPI, highspeed sureties, and more. We are by far the broadest one-stop-shop for high-quality blocks in all key manufacturing processes down to 7 nanometer and below. As customers trust our IP for their most demanding new designs, we expect continued strength going forward.While Synopsys is fortunate to lead in a number of areas, we continually evolve our strategy to stay ahead of emerging opportunities. Our entry into Software Integrity almost 5 years ago is a prime example of this. In this new market we offer solutions to identify and address security vulnerabilities and quality defects early in the software development cycle, that is while code is being written. Through both organic investments and key acquisitions, we have built a new market position -- one that is nicely adjacent to EDA but also constitutes a major new turn. For Synopsys that means a high-growth industry and diversification of our customer base, reaching software developers in key verticals such as financial services, automotive, and medical devices.The most recent acquisitions, Cigital and Black Duck, have been very successful in enabling high-level strategic engagements with customers, demand creation, cross-selling, and significantly increased brand recognition. In 2019, we plan to deliver a comprehensive Software Integrity platform which is designed to provide a streamlined more robust solution in what has been highly fragmented market, delivering high value for our customers. Social Integrity is poised to reach roughly 10% or our total revenue in fiscal '19 while progressing toward profitability. We are evaluating the best way to manage the business and will report its results and we'll make a decision in Q1.Rounding things out, a few comments about the economic landscape. Following two years of very strong revenue growth in the semiconductor industry, analysts are forecasting continued growth, albeit, at a more modest pace. Design activity, however, continues unabated. Learning from experience, customers prioritize electronic design through all parts of the business cycle. In addition, exciting new verticals, many new AI entrants and continued complexity growth are bolstering the demand for our solutions.With a portfolio of products and services aimed directly at the most critical electronic challenges in the world, we're confident in our position and feel a great deal of vitality in our outlook. Furthermore, our solid financial foundation, recurring revenue business model, and diversified customer base augments that confidence and sense of momentum. As a result, we're raising our financial ambitions with the intent to drive double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth over the next several years.In closing, fiscal 2018 was an excellent year for Synopsys. We delivered double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth with strength across all product groups and all geographies. We're poised for the next phase of growth, leveraging a number of game-changing new products in EDA, delivering on a strong pipeline of advanced IP cores, and continuing to scale revenue and possibility in software security. I want to thank our employees, customers, partners, and investors for their hard work, support, and confidence.Let me now turn the call over to Trac. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. To echo Aart's comments, we had an outstanding year financially, operationally, and strategically. Not only did we surpass the $3 billion mark and report our best non-GAAP earnings to date, but we also delivered on our multi-year initiative to drive sustainable long-term growth through targeted investments and strategic diversification. These investments contributed to what was a record year across the board. We saw strength throughout our portfolio, and each of our geographies generated double-digit growth.As we enter the next phase and look to $4 billion, we're confident in our long-term prospects. To reflect this confidence, we are raising our long-term financial objectives, which I'll describe in greater detail momentarily.First, I'll review the fourth quarter of 2018 results. All comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. We generated total revenue of $795 million in Q4 and $3.12 billion for the year, reflecting growth of 14% and 15%, respectively. Our 3-year backlog grew more than $300 million to $4 billion which, along with our recurring revenue model, provides a level of stability and predictability not often seen in enterprise software companies.Total GAAP cost and expenses were $734 million for the quarter and $2.76 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $658 million for the quarter and $2.43 billion for the year. The resulting non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 22.1% as we made targeted investments to further strengthen our business while continuing to deliver strong earnings growth. GAAP earnings per share were $1.66 for the quarter and $2.82 for the year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.78 for the quarter, and $3.91 for the year, an increase of 13% and 14%, respectively. We generated $131 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and $424 million for the year. This was below our historical levels due to approximately 230 million one-time items which are detailed in our financial supplement. We ended the year with a cash balance of $723 million with total debt of $469 million.We completed the $165 million accelerated share repurchase begun in May of this year, bringing the total buybacks to $400 million in 2018. Over the last three years, we've repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock, reducing the share count by 5 million shares. We also used our cash to acquire Black Duck, adding the market leader and open-sourced security testing to our Software Integrity group. Black Duck came in at the high end of our plan, with $60 million in revenue and was slightly less diluted than we expected at approximately $0.10 for 2018. Black Duck remains on track to break even on the second half of 2019. Now that the Black Duck acquisition is largely integrated, we will no longer report its individual results.The combined Software Integrity business has maintained its rapid pace of growth, reaching approximately $280 million in 2018 and approaching sufficient scale to progress toward solid profitability. Given this change, we're evaluating how best to manage the operations and the visibility provided to investors going forward. We will make a decision in Q1.Before moving to our outlook, I would like to note that our financial supplement includes a summary of certain discreet operating items that we've referenced this quarter and earlier in the year.Turning now to guidance, I'll start with a brief discussion of what to expect from our transition from ASC 605 to ASC 606. It's important to note that while this is an accounting transition only and will not affect cash generation or how we manage the business. While revenue recognition for the rest of the business will remain largely unchanged, we will see an impact on the timing of revenue associated with our multi-year IP licensed contracts. Under 605 rules, the effective contracts were recognized ratably. Under 606 rules, these non-cancellable contracts are still recognized over time, but their revenue will now be recognized when the customer requests delivery of specific titles.This change has no impact on the total value of the contracts but will continue to greater quarter-to-quarter variability with respect to IP revenue. During this transition year, there's a one-time recast of our backlog under the new 606 rules. This will cause a portion of our backlog that would have been recognized under 605 rules in 2019 and beyond to be directly reported as routine earnings under 606 rules. We expect the transition to ASC 606 to result in a reduction to 2019 revenue of approximately $40 million, with the impact declining to neutral within two years. Our financial supplement contains additional details on the transition to ASC 606.Before moving to our official targets for 2019, let me provide some apples-to-apples comparisons under 605 rules. Under ASC 605 revenue for fiscal 2019 is expected to be between $3.34 billion and $3.37 billion, an increase of 7% to 8%, or approximately 9% excluding the extra week in 2018. GAAP earnings are expected to be $3.01 to $3.11 per share, with non-GAAP earnings of $4.40 to $4.47 per share, implying a non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of just over 24%, an increase of approximately 200 basis points. These numbers reflect an outlook for another strong year with double-digit earnings growth and solid margin expansion, consistent with the financial objectives we've previously communicated.I will now provide our official full year, first quarter guidance under the new ASC 606 rules. For 2019 the full year targets are revenue of $3.29 billion to $3.34 billion, total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.87 billion and $2.817 billion, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.53 billion and $2.55 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin with a midpoint of approximately 23.5%. Other income expenses between minus $14 million and minus $10 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%, outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million, GAAP earnings of $2.80 to $2.90 per share, non-GAAP earnings $4.20 to $4.27 per share. Cash flow from operations of approximately $700 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $270 million. This includes a build-out of a facility in China and the relocation of some Silicon Valley offices. We expect CAPEX to throughout roughly in half in 2020.For the first quarter, the targets are revenue between $775 million to $810 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $677 million to $693 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $612 million to $622 million. Other income and expenses between minus $5 million and minus $3 million. A non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%, outstanding shares between 153 and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.56 to $0.64 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.95 to $1.00 per share.I'll close with an update to our long-term financial objectives. Based on the strong position we've built across the portfolio, we are now setting a goal to drive annual double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth through a mix of high single-digit total revenue growth consisting of EDA and mid to high single-digits, IT systems in the low double-digits, a Software Integrity growth of around 20%. Simultaneously, we intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins to the high 20s over time with a goal of 26% by 2021. We plan to accomplish this through a mix of revenue growth, prudent expense management, and continued scaling of Software Integrity. Our capital allocation strategy remains a balance of organic investments, M&A, and buybacks.To wrap up, this quarter closed out a great year for Synopsys. Because of the decisions and investments we've made, the business is well positioned to continue on this path through 2019 and beyond. The updated financial objectives we laid out today reflect confidence in our ability to deliver strong profitable growth as we move toward $4 billion in revenue....And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.And ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question press * then 1 on your touchtone phone. You'll hear a tone indicating you've been placed into queue. You can withdraw your question at any time by pressing the # key. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, for questions press * then 1 at this time.And our first question from the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.Okay. Just to verify, the Software Integrity group, excluding design IP, was what? Roughly $260 million for the fiscal year '18?$280 million.$280 million. Okay. And I see that your percentage of revenue forecast for fiscal year '19 to come out of backlog is about 70% and been dropping 5 percentage points each of the last three years. Is that a function of the revenue shift toward IP in Software Integrity? Or is there something else going on there?So, the first part of the question is yes. We are reporting inventory levels, and that's to support the demand of hardware and the timing when customers do the hardware. I missed the second part of your question.Yes, we go next to the line of Rich Valera with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.Sure. The delivery of the platform is scheduled in 2019. We have been too specific of the exact dates, but in all fairness, you know, platforms like that get delivered into multiple pieces and we have, already, a number of using it in alpha versions. The thing to realize is, while we have developed a lot of software inside of the existing Software Integrity group, we have also made a number of acquisitions over the last few years. And so, it is a mixture of integrating those acquisitions and simultaneously modifying them sufficiently so that they actually fit in seamlessly in a platform.And I personally witnessed by visiting a number of the larger customers the desire to have solutions that are broader, that have the same interfaces, the same representations of data, and can be navigated more easily from one product to another or looking at statistics from a management point of view. And so, that is the direction that the platform is taking.So, we have good hopes that this is a great way to broaden our market appeal while still racing forward with the individual products that are in quite good demand.Thank you. We go next to Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.The answer is no, we have not seen any impact. Of course, we are well attuned at all the back and forth and the tension discussions. At the same time, we have done extremely well in China, as we have in '18 in the rest of the world. But China certainly stands out as an area of good growth for us. But also, a quite diversified growth and so, from that perspective, we are essentially planning a continuation of course. But if there are external changes, they tend to be beyond the things that we can control.Okay, and then a quick follow-up. We noticed no repurchase activity under the 325 remaining under the authorization. Any particular reason for that?In this particular quarter -- in the last quarter.Yes, we did -- we completed our $165 million ASR.Okay, fair enough. Thank you.To our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.Well, the good news is that I think we've already seen some acceleration. And maybe let me formulate it differently than in the preamble -- we really introduced two products and the solidification of the platform. The first product was actually a next version of the synthesizer. For those people that have an existing design methodology -- they fundamentally don't want to change things -- they can immediately adopt a next version that has just much better results. And that adoption will follow the same adoptions that we have when we have new releases or very fundamentally new releases of products.For Fusion Compiler, that is really reaching beyond that in that it is the deep integration or fusion, as we call it, of multiple products while simultaneously adding new technologies. And there we have quite a number of customers that are in the early phases of adoption and we have high hopes because the results are looking quite good. But with all products that are quite advanced, we make sure that there is sufficient hand-holding so that they make the transition well.So, bottom line of all of this is we look at the Fusion platform as really the basis for the next decade of advancement. That's why I was mentioning that over time there will be more capabilities rolling in as we now have the fundamental data representations and ability to mix and match algorithms. That will add value to many different tools.With respect to hardware, in terms of perhaps mitigating its variability and/or just growing the TAM, have you given any thought to deploying HAPS and/or ZeBu outside VBA? Meaning, for example, high-performance computer requirements in entirely other industries like financial services or non-EDA technical software, for example, where you could run other kinds of simulation and solvers on your hardware in wholly new industries that aren't solely tied to (inaudible) or electronic systems?Yes, we have definitely thought about that. I would caution that one of the reasons for success of these types of machines is that they invariably tend to be very focused on market segments, where you truly can accelerate things massively. And so, there's always a trade-off between the ultimate speed and the generality of the application. Having said that, the domain of acceleration, the domain of existing algorithms, domain of AI algorithms -- is absolutely in the midst of a lot of change. And we are exploring a number of areas to see what we could do that would create value.I think it's a bit early to talk about specifics, but right now we're racing forward with what we have in the market that we have. And I think we see a lot of opportunities there.You're welcome.Thank you. We go next to Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.Well, the reason is that we've seen a lot of vertical industries banking on the fact that electronics -- or AI as the intersection of electronics and algorithms -- is going to have a very big impact. And so, with that, the amount of design and the focus on multiplicity of architectures is very high and we expect continuation of aggressive design.Secondly, these designs are much more complex than what we've seen, you know, five years ago and so, in that sense, the opportunity of the market will continue for those companies that can stay in tune with these advances. And we certainly are and intend to be in a leadership position for that. So, in general, the confidence is positive and so you counter to that the volume of semiconductors, or the pricing being somewhat in question for next year. In balance, we feel that we are in a good position.Well, on the growth, yes, we're definitely aiming at those numbers. And we think that we have a good shot of continuing on the good trajectory that we're on. Any comment on profitability?All right. Thanks. The last one for me, you know, one question that we have been getting is we are seeing slowdown in semiconductor industry, so are you seeing any impact from this? Could you talk about your pipeline visibility? Thank you.Well, we're not seeing any impact from the expectations of overall size of the semiconductor industry. And I think that's partially due to the fact that -- you know, we're not immune to some of the ups and downs -- but our business is greatly tempered by the ups and downs because engineering efforts continue good or bad weather. And in many situations, companies actually make sure that they invest well in their new products in order to differentiate in what may be a more challenging market.So, in that sense, I think EDA, in general, has done well in the ups and downs of the industry. And then the other is just the practical situation that we see a lot of chips being designed.Thank you so much.You're welcome.Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, if you do have additional questions you can press * then 1 on your phone keypad. Our next question from Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.Hi guys, it's Joshua Tilton on for Gal. In the beginning, you mentioned the world of smart-connect everything. It's my understanding that the emergence of smartphone was a big driver for the EDA vendors. Can you maybe frame the state of today's design environment in regards to IoT relative to the early days of mobile? In other words, if a smartphone is just a connected device, when you put it simply, so if everything now becomes a connected device how much bigger is the IoT smart connected world opportunity relative to what smartphone was?You have a lot of questions in one question. Let me first position what mobility meant. And yes, of course, we call that smartphone but the smart then meant mostly a phone that had a lot of really interesting application and those applications are extremely connected with each other. And so, you see capability such as Facebook or many of the apps that give you GPS information, restaurants, and so on. That word smart was more reflective of the first time being able to do that on a phone.When we now talk about the word smart, we really refer to the embedding of AI technology. And so, that is a degree of reasoning that has not been seen before, and of course, on one hand, you can say that's a continuum and I would agree with that. On the other hand, from a technology point of view, the computation that goes with AI is highly specialized, is very hungry for more computation, and sensitive, also, to not using too much power.And so, it's in that context that it is true that in the previous ten years, mobility drove chip design because succeeding computation -- the years before that -- it had this additional demand of low power because phones are portable and battery driven. Well, this time we have an additional push, which is they want also faster computation and therefore people will design chips that do only AI in order to be fast and low power.And so, that's a whole next generation and I'm the first one to say, I think, we are at the very beginnings of this. There will be some great successes -- have been already. There will be some that we'll have to rethink things. And so, it's a very dynamic industry but we can feel it because we see a very large number of companies -- start-ups and very large system companies investing in AI techniques. And so, I expect that to continue for us.Thank you. Just what I wanted to hear.You're welcome.Thank you, and I'll turn it back to the room for our closing remarks.Well, we appreciate your listening in. I understand the market is closed and you must be working anyway and so are we. And so, we are looking back over on a very strong 2018. The last five years we've made many changes to the company that have put us in a good position, including diversifying toward a broader TAM that has a lot of future promise, and also investing in many of the technologies that have driven and will continue to drive -- let me call it -- Synopsys classics, so to speak.And so, we hope that we will be able to share continued good results in 2019 and we hope you have a good transition into the New Year. Thank you very much....Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Fund ETF (Symbol: EPS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $36.00 per unit.With EPS trading at a recent price near $30.59 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.67% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EPS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (Symbol: LH), CoStar Group, Inc. (Symbol: CSGP), and Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS). Although LH has traded at a recent price of $143.33/share, the average analyst target is 25.19% higher at $179.43/share. Similarly, CSGP has 24.89% upside from the recent share price of $365.82 if the average analyst target price of $456.89/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SNPS to reach a target price of $109.83/share, which is 22.79% above the recent price of $89.45. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LH, CSGP, and SNPS:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

n the current bearish markets, investors often try to undertake complex investment strategies to generate solid returns. But this may not yield desired results all the time. So, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals to select stocks, is a safe and sound approach for making profits.One such strategy is sales growth. Often overlooked by investors in favor of earnings, steady sales growth is vital for survival of business. While earnings are vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated and inflated, there are very less chances of inflating sales numbers.The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales generally get converted into growth. Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles and offers limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit, but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without impressive sales growth, bottom-line improvement will not be sustainable over the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires strong sales growth.Nonetheless, sales growth in isolation doesn't indicate much about a company's future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits.Hence, taking into consideration a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs - an optimal situation for it. This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.

ynopsys (SNPS) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $0.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of software used to test and develop chips would post earnings of $0.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.95, delivering a surprise of 3.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Synopsys, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $795.08 million for the quarter ended October 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.07%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $696.64 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .Synopsys shares have added about 4.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1%.While Synopsys has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Synopsys was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options become available today, for the December 2019 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 427 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new December 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $80.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $89.42/share today.Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.65% return on the cash commitment, or 4.83% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $89.42/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $95.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.62% if the stock gets called away at the December 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.38% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.31% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 35%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 32%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $89.42) to be 21%.

egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 27.2, after changing hands as low as $90.59 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 42.9. A bullish investor could look at SNPS's 27.2 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of SNPS shares:    Looking at the chart above, SNPS's low point in its 52 week range is $80.13 per share, with $103.40 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $90.35.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Synopsys Enters Oversold Territory@2018-10-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-enters-oversold-territory-2018-10-08

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for Synopsys (SNPS). Shares have lost about 0.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Synopsys due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Synopsys reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top-line and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 95 cents, 3.3% higher than the year-ago figure, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents.The company's fiscal third-quarter revenues jumped 12.1% year over year to $779.7 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $775 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by the proliferation of digital intelligence, leading to increased investments by semiconductor and systems companies, and software developers, which in turn is leading to increased adoption of Synopsys' products. Strength in IP and rapid growth in software products also drove revenues.Segment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) came in at $669.6 million, up nearly 11% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues jumped 20.2% year over year to $110.1 million.By product group, revenues from Core EDA (55% of total) increased 5.2% to $428.5 million.

This version includes new solutions aiming to enhance optical engineering productivity with cost-effective measures and accelerate time-to-market.The 11.2 version features an array of new solutions including improved SpecBuilder feature, enclosed energy analyses, enhanced Asphere Writer utility and Enhanced optimization constraints among others.CODE V optical design software is used to model, analyze, optimize and support the development of optical systems for sundry applications. This software features optical ray tracing and provides optical techniques plus calculations to create superior designs.The CODE V is popular for its efficiency in saving time and money. This technology has been adopted by multiple key customers, helping the company rake in revenues.The adoption of CODE V technology is gaining momentum because of surging demand in the market for software products. | Synopsis' revenues are consistently driven by the proliferation of digital intelligence, leading to increased investments by software developers, which in turn, is leading to increased adoption of the company's solutions.Rapid growth in software products is driving the company's top line. The company's EDA design solutions are helping design new artificial intelligence (AI) engines. Notably, its recently launched Fusion Technology received accolades from Samsung Electronics, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba and ANSYS.In the last reported quarter, revenues from Core EDA, comprising 55% of the company's total revenues, increased 5.2% year over year.Notably, the company's acquisitions are helping it to access new market segments and enrich its product portfolio. This January, Synopsys acquired Kilopass Technology, which is expected to aid the company to offer a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions.Moreover, Black Duck emerges as one of its most significant transactions besides Sidense and QuantumWise. The company expects the first to be accretive to its top line over the long run.However, what makes us cautious is the tough rivalry offered by EDA vendors such as, Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics.These companies offer products that are more focused on distinct phases of the IC design process, providing a range of services to companies throughout the world to help optimize the respective product development process. The product facilities could stiffen competition, inducing pricing pressure for Synopsys.Synopsys currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Fortinet, Inc.  and Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth for Fortinet and Vishay is projected to be 16.8% and 9.16%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

he market expects Synopsys (SNPS) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on December 5. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of software used to test and develop chips is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13%.Revenues are expected to be $794.55 million, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Synopsys, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synopsys will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Synopsys would post earnings of $0.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.95, delivering a surprise of +3.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Synopsys doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I am happy to report that Synopsys delivered another outstanding quarter and passed the $3 billion mark in trailing 12-month revenue, an exciting milestone as we enter our next phase of growth. And it's a good time to thank our Synopsys team, our customers, our partners, and all of you for your support. We entered fiscal 2018 with expectations for solid revenue, earnings, and cash flow.As a result of strong customer demand and excellent execution, we're on track to substantially exceed the targets we communicated last November and expect to deliver double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth for the year. For Q3, we posted revenue of $780 million, with strength across all product groups. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.95, and we generated $289 million in operating cash flow. We repurchased $165 million of our stock, bringing the total for the year to $400 million.Lastly, we're raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Trac will provide more detail in a moment. The customer environment is strong as the age of AI, or digital intelligence, drives hefty investments by traditional and new semiconductor and systems companies as well as software developers across many industries. Investments are directed at supplying the increasing demand for compute power, cloud storage, and networking infrastructure, all in support of massive data and complex software.Add to that a huge and growing challenge of security, and one can readily see that the need for design solutions will continue to expand for years to come. Synopsys is uniquely positioned to address these technological challenges, sitting at the intersection of hardware and software. As a result, we've grown and strengthened our leadership position in EDA, built a strong and broad IP business group, and branched out into the large adjacent TAM of software security and quality. In this context, let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA.The primary driver of EDA growth is complexity, whether due to more advanced process technologies, sophisticated designs at established nodes or immense amounts of software embedded on a chip. In our entire history, leadership in electronic complexity had been the differentiator for the Synopsys solutions. Today, this means moving to 7, 5 or even 3 nanometer process technologies. With our TCAD and lithography tools, we're a key partner in the initial stages of manufacturing process development.These early engagements benefit all subsequent products as demonstrated by some of the successes in the quarter. We announced broad certification for several Samsung Foundry advance processes, from digital and custom design to verification. And just last week, we announced a collaboration with IBM to enable their very advanced process development with our manufacturing digital design and IP capabilities. Our design platform generated revenue greater than planned, reaching an all-time high with accelerating growth over the past year.On the digital side, our recently introduced Fusion Technology, which brings about a revolutionary new level of integration between synthesis, place-and-route, and signoff is really hitting the mark with customers. Not only does the Fusion Technology provide a fundamental infrastructure to design better chips, but we've already embedded a number of AI techniques that further improve speed, area, and power. Engagements with partners and customers have grown. Samsung Foundry has certified our Fusion Technology for its 7 nanometer Low Power Plus process with EUV.Multimedia SoC provider, Vatics, standardized on this technology after realizing 40% runtime reduction. We're seeing plan of record adoption by several high-profile systems companies. And at the Design Automation Conference, industry leaders, AMD, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Renesas, and Samsung presented the benefits that the new technology brings to their implementation flows, highlighting solid early results.Now to verification, where we also delivered an excellent quarter. Demand is high for our Verification Continuum platform built upon the fastest engines in the industry and our number one positions in all three key areas: Emulation, FPGA-based prototyping, and verification software.Verification hardware had another very strong quarter, with broad-based adoptions and renewals. High-profile companies Samsung, Intel, and AMD presented to fellow engineers at DAC their real-life successes using ZeBu. In Q3, we announced general availability of ZeBu Server 4, the industry's fastest and largest capacity emulation system. With 2X the performance over competing systems, ZeBu is ideal for the extremely demanding verification requirements in automotive, 5G, networking, machine learning, and data center SoCs.In analog simulation, Toshiba Memory and Synopsys collaborated to accelerate the 3D flash memory verification. The resulting technologies address increasing design complexity and reduce multi-day simulation runs to less than a day. Let me now move to IP, where we expect another record year. Double-digit growth in IP is driven by several dynamics: one, continued outsourcing of semiconductor IP blocks; two, an increasingly broad portfolio covering interfaces, embedded memories, security, and processor IP optimized for high-growth markets such as automotive, AI and cloud computing; three, coverage of leading-edge and established process nodes; and four, the demand for IP subsystem that make it easier and more efficient for customers to outsource their designs to us.We're seeing strong demand for our processor IP solutions, notably the ARC-embedded vision processor that features the industry's first ASIL D Ready embedded vision IP for autonomous driving applications. Our acquisitions in nonvolatile memory are also bearing fruit with significant orders in the quarter across many different market segments. Now to software integrity where Synopsys provides testing for security vulnerabilities and quality defects in software code during the development phase. While software developers in our traditional customer base are prime growth opportunity for us, the number of companies who develop and rely on software as a critical component of their business is much broader than EDA and IP.This mounting need in verticals such as medical devices, financial services, automotive, aerospace, and industrials represents a large TAM that we're just beginning to tap. Our mission is to enable companies to more easily test both open source and proprietary code through a combination of a unified tool platform and consulting services. With general availability planned for next year, we're making steady progress toward our Software Integrity Platform with early testing happening now. An important part of the platform is the set of Black Duck's testing tools, which address the growing need to diagnose security risks in open-source software.A recent analysis of more than 1,100 commercial code bases found that 96% of applications scanned had open-source components. 78% contained at least one open-source vulnerability with an average of 64 vulnerabilities per code base. The integration of Black Duck is going well. For us, this is visible through both early cross-selling opportunities and enhanced brand recognition.Our services organization is another important aspect of our holistic approach to assisting the customer journey toward a more mature security development process. The progress made over the past four years has been recognized by industry leaders such as Gartner and others, stimulating further strong interest by new customers. For example, at the recent Black Hat security conference, we received around 7,000 inquiries from current and potential customers, nearly doubling last year's tally. From a financial perspective, we're also executing well.We have reached critical mass, passing $0.25 billion in trailing 12-month revenue and are quite enthusiastic about the future potential. Reaching up into emerging vertical market segment, automotive is a key focus for Synopsys, not only in software security but across our entire portfolio. Our unique virtual prototyping is gaining traction across the automotive supply chain. By providing models of critical chips and subsystems, Tier 1s and OEMs can start software development earlier to better meet strict time-to-market objectives.We've collaborated with the leading automotive semiconductor companies to create the most comprehensive ISO 26262 qualified tool flow with differentiated technologies for functional safety and reliability. At DAC, we hosted an automotive panel with leaders from NVIDIA, Panasonic, TSMC, and NSITEXE, a division of leading automotive Tier 1, Denso, who shared their successes with Synopsys. We also have the most comprehensive portfolio of automotive certified IP, ranging from our ASIL D embedded vision processor to key interfaces and memories. To summarize our strategy over the past several years, our actions have been deliberate.First, maintain and grow our leadership in EDA. As the market leader, we're rolling out new leading-edge technology and have gained share. Second, continue to broaden our IP portfolio and customer adoption. As the number two global IP vendor, we build the most comprehensive portfolio of high-value titles and continue to see double-digit revenue growth.And third, enter and scale the brand new high-growth TAM and diversified customer base in software integrity. We believe that we've reached critical mass by passing the $0.25 billion mark, having built a recognizable brand and are poised for ongoing 20% organic growth. During the past years, we made significant investments both organically and through M&A. We did these while also delivering on our guidance for high single-digit EPS growth.In fact, in the last two years, Synopsys overachieved delivering double-digit revenue and earnings growth and crossing the $3 billion mark earlier than our own internal projections over two years ago. This backdrop provides a solid foundation for continued growth and increased operating leverage in the business. We will be in a position to provide an update to our long-term operating model objectives and assumptions when we report next quarter. For now, I will say that we currently intend to drive non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 26% over the next three years, with a longer-term ambition of high 20s.As we are presently in the middle of our budgeting process, we're not yet ready to provide 2019 guidance. But even with the change in revenue accounting next year, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase in FY '19. To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and are raising revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Our strategic investments over the past several years are paying off.Near term, our strong products and customer relationships in EDA and IP are leading to very good revenue and EPS growth. Longer term, our expansion into the new software security and quality TAM is making excellent progress. Let me now turn the call over to Trac. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Reaching $3 billion in revenue is a great accomplishment that not only reflects our financial execution but also demonstrates that our strategy and investments for the long term are paying off. This is evident in our strong performance this quarter and improved outlook for Q4.As a result, we're raising our 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Now to the numbers. As I talked to you the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 12% to $780 million, reflecting strength across our product portfolio in all geographies.Total GAAP cost and expenses were $716 million, which includes a $26 million charge for the Mentor Graphics patent litigation settlement. Total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $612 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 21.5%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.52. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.95, exceeding our target range due to strong revenue growth and operational execution.Operating cash flow for the quarter was $289 million, reflecting very strong collections and offset by a onetime payment of $65 million related to the Mentor legal settlement. Cash and cash equivalents at quarter end were $741 million, 18% of which is onshore with total debt at $622 million. We launched a $165 million accelerated share repurchase in May, bringing our total buybacks for the year-- bringing our total buybacks year-to-date to $400 million. As a result, we've been able to reduce our share count versus last year.We currently have $325 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We're progressing very well with our integration of Black Duck and remain on track to achieve our 2018 target of $55 million to $60 million of revenue. This estimate reflects a purchase accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $20 million. In addition, we continue to expect Black Duck to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS and to reach breakeven in the second half of 2019.Before moving on to guidance, let me provide some brief commentary about the new ASC 606 revenue accounting rules, which will go into effect for us in fiscal 2019 beginning in November. As we've previously discussed, we do expect a onetime loss backlog at the time of transition. While revenue recognized under the new rules will be slightly lower than under the current rules, we do not expect a material impact based on our current forecast, and there's no impact on cash flows or the economics of the business. As we look to 2019, please note that we're still working through our normal budgeting process and are assessing the business outlook coming off another record hardware and IP year in 2018.Therefore, we would suggest that it's premature to change your 2019 estimates until we provide detailed guidance next quarter. We will also provide a full year-- full view of our long-term operating model objectives and assumptions at that time. In the meantime, let me reiterate what Aart said. We intend to increase operating margin in 2019 and beyond with the goal of reaching 26% in the next three years in the high 20s longer term.Now to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance, which reflects overachievement in Q3 and incremental upside in Q4. For Q4, the targets are: revenue between $774 million and $804 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $722 million and $738 million; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $655 million and $665 million; other income and expenses between minus $3 million and minus $1 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.39 to $0.47 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.76 to $0.80 per share.The revised targets for fiscal 2018 are therefore: revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.13 billion; other income and expenses between minus $5 million and minus $3 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $1.55 to $1.63 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $3.89 to $3.93 per share; capital expenditures of about $100 million-- $110 million; and cash flow from operations of $460 million to $500 million, reflecting the onetime Mentor legal settlement. In conclusion, we delivered strong Q3 results and are raising full-year guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, reflecting another year of double-digit growth. We reached $3 billion in revenue by investing to carry out our growth strategy while also delivering on the earnings commitment and returning cash to shareholders through our consistent stock repurchase program.We're confident in our balanced approach to maximizing long-term shareholder value, making the most of compelling revenue growth opportunities while also driving operating leverage. Let me now turn it over to the operator for questions.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Mobley with Benchmark. -- Hello, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper into your implied Q4 operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. I believe the implied operating margin is, what, 16.5%, down about 500 basis points sequentially, down about 700 basis points from what you're implying 2019 operating margin maybe? So, I'm just curious what sort of investments are being made.Black Duck seemingly would be just a small contribution to that dilution. And well, I'll stop there and change the question. -- OK, Gary. Yes, you're in the ballpark, Gary. It's really a timing of the expenses and nothing unusual. I would take the Q4 expense ramp and normalize it for next year.Given how strong our outlook is for the year, we are seeing a true-up in our variable account program this quarter and the next quarter as well. So it's really a reflection of a very strong outlook for the year. -- All right. And your main competitor announced a cloud-based delivery system at the Design Automation Conference. And I think your position has been that maybe the infrastructure isn't ready from a security standpoint, from a file system standpoint, and just from a latency standpoint. I wondered if you have softened on that stance, and maybe just give us your latest thoughts on whether or not EDA is ready for the cloud. -- Sure. The first thing is to understand clearly why people are interested in the cloud is to find the sort of the sweet spot between available performance and the economics, and this is often driven by the need to have point utilization go up for short periods of time, for example. From a practical point of view, all large customers have very large clouds themselves. We have a very large cloud.And actually, we have quite a number of customers that are running the software on our own cloud. And we have a substantial number of customers that are running our software on commercial clouds already. It's also noteworthy to say that we have an ability to provide also our emulation through the cloud. And so the combination of all of those have definitely provided opportunities for customers to either get peak performance, or if they're very small, to start without having to make big investments.The [Inaudible] security is one that, on one hand, have dramatically improved, on the other hand, never quite goes away. And you're correct that quite a number of years ago there was a very high concern about security, and rightfully so, I would say. Today, that is substantially better resolved. It is also the case that customers are a little bit more centered in terms of how they look at the issue.I think on the margin, any system retains certain vulnerabilities and, of course, that is helped-- or hopefully helped by our other part of our business. But fundamentally, I think the time for doing certain things on a variety of clouds is upon us. -- Thank you, guys. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. -- Thank you. A question on operating margin. You've done quite a bit of M&A in the software integrity business, which you've indicated is going to be dilutive to margin this year. Is there any way you could give us a sense of what the operating margin of the base business will be without the SI business, without software integrity business? -- That's a good question, Rich. I think if you were to look at the commentary that we provided in the past around our investments in Black Duck's digital and even [Inaudible]-- even Coverity when we started five years ago, it would probably-our overall operating margins will probably go up on the order of 250 basis points because of the investments in the new TAM. -- Yes. If I can answer that, you may recall that every time we made one of the major acquisitions, we said that notwithstanding the fact that these companies typically tended to not be particularly profitable in the first place, there was a haircut in that we typically would work through those in a period of 18 to 36 months. And I grant you, that's a fairly broad window, but the circumstances are all different. I think we're living up very much to that.And so, an additional reason why we think that now, the time has arrived for that business to see some operating leverage is that we are at critical mass. The integrations have gone well. And in general, the markets that we hoped would be a positive market has definitely manifested itself, so we see growth opportunities. So, it's our job now to make sure that that additional growth comes up to a high degree of profitability. -- Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up to that, Trac. The plus 250, what baseline would that be relative to? Is that sort of relative to your expected fiscal '18 baseline? -- Yes, Rich. That refers to where we are today. -- Got it. And then just one more on the ZeBu Server 4. Nice to see that went GA at DAC. Can you say if there was-- I know it was in production with-- limited production release, I guess, before that with, I think you mentioned 10 customers or more in that release.But was there pent-up demand of customers that wanted ZeBu Server 4 and now they're getting it sort of in this current quarter and beyond? -- I wouldn't say pent-up demand. I think that we managed the demand by virtue of introducing the product gradually, which allowed us to make sure that it was really solid by the time we went to channel availability. And also, some customers were clearly further ahead in their thinking about how to ring up software on hardware as part of a strategy to increase the speed with which they could bring their products to market. And there are now a number of quite extraordinary stories of chips for cellphones, for example, for smartphones, that literally shaves off a number of months to go to market.And I can't-- don't have to tell you that that's a market that is hyper competitive. And so I think the capabilities are coming online at the very moment where the demand is strong, and so we have high hopes for the new Server 4 ZeBu. -- Got it. Congratulations on the strong results. Thanks, everyone. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Tom Diffley with D.A. Davidson. -- Thank you, [Inaudible]. Just to follow-up on the operating margin projection you have over the next three years, so is most of that increase coming from the Software Integrity side [Inaudible] as well as some restricted [Inaudible] -- Hi, Tom. I had a hard time hearing you, but I think the question was, where the operating margin expansion coming from, whether it's specifically to Software Integrity across the board. I would-- the short answer is it's going to be across the board. Having reached $3 billion of revenues, we're at a point where we should be able to drive more operating leverage in the business.The expansion is going to come through a combination of both solid revenue growth going forward and looking for improvements in the way that we're executing on the various businesses. -- OK. Would you expect the Software Integrity business acquisition rate to slow then going forward? -- Well, we generally don't comment on what our acquisition strategy is. And so going into it, we'll look at each deal on its own and whether or not it fits into the overall strategy. -- OK. And, Trac, I know it's early, but can you give us a feel for what you're seeing right now for the tax rate for next year. I mean, I assume it's going to go up several hundred basis points? -- Are you asking about the tax rate, Tom? -- Correct. Yes. -- It's still a little early, but I think I would say it's safe to say it's somewhere between 13 and where it's been historically, 19. And again, we are in the midst of working through how we're going to approach the tax strategy going forward in light of the very significant changes in the U.S. taxes. -- OK. And then finally, when you look at the-- some of the advance nodes, the 5 nanometer, the 3 nanometer nodes, how large are those nodes today from a business point of view for you? Are they just nodes you want to get in front before they happen, or is it meaningful revenue today? -- So, the if you look at the advanced nodes, the nodes that are now moving into substantial production that re most advanced is really 7 nanometer. The 5 nanometer is now technically ready, and the first designs are being done. And the 3 nanometer is, at least, to say it, at least, is a work in progress, I would say. But what is quite astounding is that these technologies would have been viewed as impossible, again, a number of years ago and here we go.And that's the theme that we know well for like over 20 years now. And so, we are in the midst of quite exciting technologies that are in high demand but also demand a high degree of sophistication of the tools, and so we feel right at home. -- OK. Thank you. -- You're welcome, Tony.Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question.Trac, just one more question on the operating margin target of sort of 26% over the next few years, given that there's now leverage as revenue grows, can you help us understand the underlying growth rate assumption to hit that target? And if you're not ready to give us sort of an absolute number, is there some way you could kind of give us a relative number to kind of the historic growth rates we didn't see? -- Yes. I think you answered the question there, John. We're not prepared to talk about the FY '19 or the components of the long-term model. But definitely, we'll give you more details of that in December.At a high level, I would refer you to comments that we made in the past in terms of where we see the growth for the different areas of the business. Traditionally, we expect growth in EDA in the low to midsingle digits. IP is comfortably in the low double digits and then Software Integrity is in that 20% range. The other thing I would highlight is in terms of revenue growth year over year keep in mind that we've got the benefit of the extra weeks for this year, which accounts for about 2% impact.And then even though I think at a high level that 606, the new rev rec rules, will be immaterial to the results. It will have a slight negative impact to the numbers, but we'll give you more details to that come December. -- That's helpful. And then, Aart, for you. I've spent the last couple of days in the Valley at the Hot Chips conference. And at least over the last couple of years, there's sort of been a resurrection of the debate in sort of general purpose compute versus ASIC, the thought process being with things like Moore's law becoming more difficult and aren't scaling, slowing, and Amdahl's law, that maybe we're entering into a world of just more ASICs over general purpose compute.I'd love to get kind of your thoughts on that debate. And I guess, more importantly, if we are moving into a more ASIC-driven world, how does that impact your business, not only within EDA, but maybe across your portfolio? -- OK. Well, in my mind, there has been no doubt already for many years that while general computing will continue to be pushed forward massively, especially at general offerings in the cloud, that the demands of the emerging machine learning and AI techniques are that with the present success, the one thing you'd like to have is not 2X more computation but 1,000X more computation. And so no matter how hard you squeeze the silicon technology, and it will get squeezed still further, there's no reason to be able to believe that you could get a 1,000 times faster results. And so what can you do? Well, the thing you can do is to, say, reduce the breadth of the problem, i.e.go to special processors that do a task particularly well, and now, suddenly, you are in the 10 and 100X more capabilities. And you can call that an ASIC or you can call it dedicated processors, but that is where this is heading at rapid speed. And the evidence is already clearly visible, and we can see it in our own business because in the last few years, we have had a number of random semiconductor companies that all are building the ultimate AI chip, and we'll see which one is the ultimate, ultimate, but the investments are broad. We see a number of existing players at substantial dedicated engines to their offering.And so I think the push will be on-- in every dimension. And we benefit from that because these are designs that all immediately go to the leading edge that use the most advanced silicon techniques that typically drive the complexity of the chip to the maximum that is manufacturable at a-- not even reasonable cost, but affordable cost, and it's driving the state-of-the-art. Lastly, I wouldn't underestimate the amount of effort that is also going into various forms of storage and, of course, the communication between processing and storage because, of course, the term big data is not new to you, and there's a lot of data. And so the key is going to be where do you keep it and how quickly does it become accessible for computation.So all of this, I think, bodes well for the domains that we are in, including the very fact that there are also some risk factors in the form of security around these systems, and we have the good fortune of touching many of those from multiple angles. -- Aart, is there any way of quantifying what this new dynamic had done either to your growth over the last couple of years or your addressable market, whether it's looking at kind of nontraditional customers of that might not have been customers a few years back, however, you want to cut it? Is there any way to sort of quantify what this does to the growth rate of the TAM? -- Well, as you know, the growth rates are a function not only of the technical needs and the demand. They're also a function of the health of the semiconductor industry. And as you may remember many years ago, actually five, six, seven years ago, there was always this lamenting of semiconductor industry not growing particularly well. Well, the opposite has been the case, precisely because that very industry supplies the hardware that makes this possible.And so it's really a phenomenon that is actually pretty broad. That doesn't mean that every year will be an incredible banner year. I think it's more that the solidity of both the market that we serve and our own market is higher. And maybe that is an additional reason why we are looking at healthy growth going forward, but also the opportunity to focus more and increase our operating leverage in that process.So, I would consider both of those terms part of a healthy market.Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Trac, maybe a couple for you. As we're sitting here trying to work our models, especially as we're working into the quarters of next fiscal year and need to understand the comparables with Black Duck, can you give us a sense of what the organic growth was in the quarter? -- The organic growth for SIG? Sure, we think the market's growing in the 20% range, and we're keeping pace with that. -- No. I'm saying for Synopsys overall. So, if you look at it, what is the organic revenue growth for Synopsys overall? -- Well, overall, I think that-- I would say the majority of what growth rate you're seeing in the business right now is organic. The acquisitions we made this year that has a material impact is really on Black Duck. And keep in mind, while we're successful in terms of driving that north of 250, this is on a $3-plus billion business. And you're seeing growth across the entire portfolio and you're seeing it across all regions.So, [Inaudible] healthy growth. -- Because I was looking at an estimate that it would be somewhere around 125 to 150 bps of impact to the growth rate in the quarter if you went organic versus reported. -- Well, we haven't talked about that separation. But I'd just say-- would safely say though, a good portion of our-- a large portion of our growth for this year is organic. And when you-- -- OK. And did you-- -- You can see where that's coming from, too, is we're having a phenomenal year on IP, and the growth rate in EDA has been very strong for the last two years. -- OK. OK. And the comment that you made about 26% operating margins over three years, since you're transitioning to ASC 606, I want to make sure we're all on the same page. Does that 26% include the benefit, if you have one, of moving to the sales commission recognition under the new rules? In other words, are you recognizing sales commissions upfront today? Are you going to move to ratable? And how would that impact that 26%? -- So, Sterling, the highest level of the increase in 26% will really be operational. As far as reporting goes, 606 has two impacts for us. One is on the impact of revenues for next year, which will be negative, but we think is immaterial. As far as the impact on commissions, the net-net of that is going to be neutral over the next few years.So, when we talk about improving operating leverage, it really truly is operating leverage as opposed to any reporting benefit or drag. And while I'm on the topic, we'll give more details in '19 at December, but we want to clarify that when we talk about margin improvement, we do expect margin improvement in 2019 even with the impact of 606. The specific amount, I think, we'll have to test out, but we do expect margins to improve. -- Excellent, and then last question. Aart, you mentioned products that are currently actually running on the Synopsys cloud and on customer clouds. I think it's easy for us to understand how verification emulation will work in the cloud because you're running kind of a batch process versus some of the actual design where you have that interaction. So, I'm kind of curious, which products are actually up and running in some of these customer or Synopsys clouds for customers? -- Well, we actually I think have examples, I would say, broadly, across the spectrum. But your opening comment is actually right on, which is that the variety of verification or analysis tools tend to go to the cloud first because they're very batch-centric. And so you do large simulations there, for example, or large verifications, and I think that will continue for a while. We have really not announced what we're doing in this area, and so I don't want to have too many comments on this.But I think the gist of your question has its own answer. It is very much verification.Our next question goes to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a few couple quick clarifying ones and one long-term one. So for the July quarter, so the one thing that happened is gross margins came down.Could you help us understand why there was a case of hardware slowing down a little bit due to the outperformance over the last couple of years? -- Keep in mind, Mitch, that there's a few things that actually roll up into COGS. It's not just hardware. So I wouldn't extrapolate changes in gross margins as strictly an impact of variation in hardware. Remember, we-- the series of acquisition that we made last year, which is the services business-- security services business, you'll see the COGS flow to that line.And then the other part is there's an element of IP, specifically the consulting part of IP that's recognized at a percentage completion basis, and you'll see COGS there. And there's really no correlation between the movement in COGS and gross margins because the variability of IP and hardware, as we've stressed over the last few years, have been very lumpy. But overall, when we look at individually at that, we feel like we're running the business in an appropriate way as far as margins for-- at the gross margin level for each of those businesses. -- Got it. And then the second clarifying one. So, your cash flow number of $460 million to $500 million, correct? So I know you guys had a bunch of onetime charges. Can you maybe walk us through what the, I guess, the normalized one would be? Because you had the Hungarian lawsuit, you had the repatriation, and you had the Mentor settlement.So, what would be kind of the more normalized cash flow number? -- Yes, you hit the big ones. So, let's take-- let's start with the guidance for the year. It's $460 million to $500 million. We had-- we have about $165 million of onetime items for this year, right? At the beginning of the year, we had a $33 million payment related to the Q4 repatriation.Early in the year, we also had an outflow of $65 million related to the Hungarian tax dispute. Now keep in mind, that's still pending, but we had to pay more to litigate. And then in this past quarter, we had a $65 million outflow for the Mentor settlement. So, at that end, it's -- you can see that the business is healthy and generating very strong cash flows.Our next question goes to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. -- Thank you. Aart, two broad questions for you about the EDA market or Synopsys as a whole. The first part is as Synopsys' business mix has evolved, including but not exclusively with SIG; and as the customer base has evolved including, in particular, meaning the rise of your systems customers, what are the external or leading indicators that you as a CEO and management use, if any, to anticipate or plan the business? And then how are you thinking about the external indicators differently perhaps now than when you were a $1 billion or $2 billion company? And then secondly, more specifically about EDA. The question was prompted by the recent announcement by NVIDIA of its Turing chip.And the question is we generally assume that customers ingest EDA tools and technologies and, voila, out the other end comes super chips of the kind that you've been talking about. But is that really so? In other words, what are you seeing? Or what do you think people need to see in terms of customers' methodologies and design implementation skills and differentiation having to change along with your tools and along with the node changes? -- OK. So, regarding the external indicators, there are obviously multiple sort of horizons around that. The macro horizon is all around the belief that the-- both connectivity and smarts of the electronics world is dramatically changing, and both of those words are relevant because they imply large amounts of data being moved around with a risk, i.e. security risk. And then-- but also is the need to be manipulated, stored and so on, and therefore, opportunities for silicon utilization and new chips.As we zoom in a little bit more into the Software Integrity business, and I assume most of your question is motivated by that, they're-- we also observed that what's different, let's say then, at least the last 10 years plus in EDA or IP, is we are still getting many more new customers, meaning logos that we have never touched or even never heard of before. While simultaneously seeing that a number of companies that we've done business with for a number of years are gradually moving to larger spending levels because they adopt more with more users or with more departments in the larger companies. And those two things, we watch, we measure, we look at the renewal rates. Essentially, we continue to try to assess, is the business healthy? And so the combination of the external landscape and the internal execution, so far, have been good.When you talk about companies like NVIDIA that are extremely sophisticated, they also have extremely sophisticated utilization of our tools, of combinations of our tools, of certain things that they have added to this. And the word methodology is right on, which is really great companies know what to pay attention to and when to pay attention to in the flow so that they: A, reduce risk; and B, maximize how much they can squeeze out at a given silicon technology. In general, to your point of do people have evolved their methodology? My answer would be absolutely yes. The complexity that we see is changing not only in scale, meaning more transistors, but also in systemic complexity, meaning more dimensions that have to be satisfied simultaneously.And the traditional dimensions of speed area and power are still very foundational, but so is now the approach to temperature, thermal issues on a chip, the dealing with the reliability and safety of certain constructs in automotive spaces and so on. And then on top of that is, increasingly, the intersection between hardware and software where a lot of issues pop up but also opportunities are sitting. So, it's in that context that we provide an increasingly large amount of methodology support and help, and also in our Fusion Technology, have integrated a number of tools together to essentially accelerate what could be viewed as methodology but is really the intersection between tools. So this may sound all somewhat convoluted and complex, and that, for us, is actually good news because that's where we add value.Our next question comes from Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, first one here, per our estimates, software security is growing 20% that you've talked about, and it could be bigger than $350 million business next year, which is a pretty good-sized business. Could you talk about how to think about the profitability of the business? And is 20% growth a right way to think about the growth? -- Well, we've said before that we do see this business growing in the 20% range. And so after that, you probably did the math correctly. We are not pre-announcing '19, but directionally, you're certainly right on the mark. From a profitability point of view, in a very rapidly growing business, we have commented on the individual pieces where each one of the companies we acquired over time were becoming profitable in 8 to 36 months.We have commented, I believe, on Black Duck turning profitable in the second half of next year. And so, you can see that in aggregate, all of that is moving in the right direction. And yes, there will be a bit of trading off how we look at growth versus profitability and how we manage that. But in the bigger picture of Synopsys, the numbers that you're mentioning essentially say this is heading toward being 10% of the overall company.And while it's material to the bottom line, it is in that range of its contribution. -- All right. Then, Aart, you are guiding to greater than 40% top-line growth for this year. Black Duck, you have given us estimates. It's probably adding 2% in organic growth. And even if I take the effect of the extra week in 2018, I mean, it'll grow definitely, accelerating year over year on an organic basis.Could you talk about the factor which is leading to higher growth? Thank you. -- Yes. Well, again, I'm a little reluctant to get too close to giving directives for '19, largely because we're not done with our own process, and we tend to not extrapolate from years that are not great and not extrapolate from years that are great. We just want to be careful in making sure that we hit it just right against what we think we can deliver. Having said that, I think the reason why overall growth is good is because the external factors of the importance of electronics-- and I'll use electronics as the broader term for a combination of hardware and software-- are very positive.The complexity is all coming our way in the EDA's direction for providing sophisticated tools. And I think that over the last few years, we have proactively made investments that maybe penalized the ops margin a bit, but we're, I think, right on from a strategic point of view. So, we feel that we're in the right position. So, the combination of all of that says, ""OK.Looking forward, it should give you predictions on '19, but we'll do that at the end of last year."" And lastly, we continue to see in a number of areas the run rate of the company grow, and so at least it says we have a fairly solid outlook. -- Just the last thing on the cloud side. Could you talk about how ready Synopsys' provisions are for usage in the cloud? And are you seeing interest from customers to use these solutions in the cloud? -- Well, we can make things work quite well in the cloud. It is different than when people own their own environment for a variety of reasons. It is also interesting that the EDA utilization of computation tends to be at the high end of sophistication, meaning that our programs are, arguably, among the most complex and demanding in the software world, period. And so, they tend to use both maximum computational power, but also need a high degree of memory availability to run the very large designs that are there.And so, we have quite a number of customers that on their own run a number of our products on the cloud. I think they are continually looking at are the economics in their favor, or are they better off if they're a large customer to do it themselves. And I think that won't go away anytime soon.Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Please go ahead. -- Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple of them. Aart, you spoke about your foundry customers doing like 7 nanometers and then 7 nanometer plus at EUV.I'm kind of curious. When your customers start doing-- when they start to introduce EUVs either for like one, two, three, five, seven, several layers, what impact does it have on EDA design? Is it a material impact? Or do you have to go and redo the design? I was kind of curious on that, and also have a follow-up question. -- OK. Well, in general, every time you introduce anything new, in reality, it reduces complexity. It adds more things that you have to know about what that technology is. And while EUV have different needs in terms of masks or fewer needs in terms of mask making, it is typically limited to only the lowest layers because it's quite expensive and slow.And the design has to be prepared well for those techniques, and so we're quite familiar with EUV needs and satisfy those. And so I wouldn't say that EUV has changed our business perspective massively. I'm looking at it more as a, well, the push for smaller dimensions is still continuing. And so it touches another part of our company more, which is the part that is doing simulations in three dimensions of very small features because some of those features are new-- are only possible if you use EUV.But for the broad designs, it is really a set of steps that is related to the manufacturing that we have solutions for. I don't think it changes our business picture all that much at this point in time. -- Got it. Got it. That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up, you guys have been interacting with your auto customers for a long time for several years now.Back in the days, like the auto customers would like to have the same design, same component or whatever design designed in for like 8 to 10, 12 years. Has that behavior changed now with increasing semiconductor content and technology going into autos? Is that cycle time shortening? Are they willing to refresh design every few years now? Or has that philosophy not changed? -- This is a very complex question, because even when you said we're attracting a lot of these automotive companies for a long time, it almost feels that we were interacting but they were not. And the reason was that automotive companies, for many, many years, had a layer of suppliers called the Tier 1s that really provide them with subsystems. And what the automotive companies did, they would give the general spec of what a subsystem needed to do to them, and the Tier 1s would deliver. And the Tier 1s, in turn, would go to the semiconductor people, and those, we certainly knew very well, and then have certain demands for automotive characteristics in the chips.And so, we have worked our way literally up the value chain, so to speak. And now in the last few years, we have suddenly had many more interactions directly with people that actually sell cars to automotive companies. And you say why did that change? Well, the change is because the two macro changes on the automotive industry, one is electrification and the second one is the push toward autonomous driving, are so phenomenally deep that companies have to deal with this. What have come down from the OEM, from the automotive companies, through this food chain all the way to us is that the notion of safety now have to be anchored in how certain chips are designed, and we are pushing right up because we're adding the notion of security, which is mostly manifested software back up to them.So to say, the least, we have a much richer set of interactions with them, the industry will, in my opinion, struggle with your question. Meaning that if you want to design something for a 20-year life, just imagine using the parts that we had 20 years ago in your most modern smartphone. It's complexly inconceivable. And so, I think these car companies are going to have to go to mechanisms where certain part of their platform is meant to survive long periods of utilization, but that some of the pieces will be upgradable over the years.And that in itself is a challenging question because if you upgrade something, can you make sure it still works. And so you can see that the number of technology problems that are moving up the value chain is phenomenal. And while we, of course, play with many others that bring great value, I think we're well-positioned to connect with these companies in multiple dimensions. My last comment is-- this is also visible, by the way, in our Software Integrity business.And we've already done a number of transactions, some quite significant, directly with automotive companies, and this is almost like coming at this company from two completely different angles. But at the end of the day, they all connect back to the intersection of hardware software.I will now turn it back over to our host for closing remarks. -- Well, thank you very much for participating in the earnings release today. It has a little bit of a special color by version of the $3 billion milestone. And so, we do appreciate that many of you have covered and followed the company for many years. And while we may differ in perspective from time to time, we also very often align and we always feel that your reporting is to the point and appreciate the very support that you have given our company.And so, onto the next milestone and thank you for the time spent today.[Operator signoff]When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 22.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 7.8%.In the last reported quarter, the company's bottom line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same. The results marked year-over-year improvement.For the third quarter, the company estimates revenues in the range of $760-$785 million and earnings per share in the range of 89-93 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings per share is pegged at $774.6 million and 92 cents, respectively.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Synopsys is benefiting from robust performance of all the product groups. Growth in semiconductor sector will be accretive for the top line of this vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software for the semiconductor and electronics industries.The company is positive about its EDA design solutions, which are helping in designing of new artificial intelligence (AI) engines. Notably, its newly launched Fusion Technology received accolades from Samsung Electronics, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba and Ansys.During the quarter, Synopsys announced that a host of its solutions has been selected by Arbe Robotics for its patented imaging radar meant for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.Synopsys's continued focus on introducing products, acquisitions and deal wins is a key growth driver. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive results. We note that the company's acquisitions are helping it to access new market segments, enriching its product portfolio and contributing to revenues.However, increasing costs and expenses are an overhang on margins. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and rising competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems are other concerns. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided.

he stock market was generally quiet again on Thursday, with minimal moves lower for most major benchmarks. Once again, technology stocks helped to support the rest of the market, and the  outperformed most other stock indexes. New tariffs once again reminded investors of the threats on the trade front, although at least in the U.S., most economic data continue to support the idea of sustained growth for the foreseeable future. Some individual companies also had good news that lifted their shares.  (NASDAQ: AMD) ,  (NASDAQ: SNPS) , and  (NASDAQ: FEYE) were among the best performers on the day. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Advanced Micro Devices picked up almost 7% after getting positive comments from Wall Street analysts. Rosenblatt Securities, which had already been highly enthusiastic about the chipmaker's prospects, boosted its price target on AMD stock by $3 to $30 per share. In particular, Rosenblatt believes that AMD has the potential to regain a rising share of the traditional PC-chip market at the same time that it's making strides toward building a competitive advantage in the fast-growing graphics processing chip market, especially for use in data-center applications. Even though  , many believe that further demand for semiconductors could keep lifting the stock.Image source: AMD.Synopsys stock rose 6% in the wake of the release of the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report. The electronic design automation specialist said that revenue for the quarter was up 12% from year-ago figures, helping to raise adjusted earnings slightly by about 3%. Both figures were better than those following the stock had expected, and the company also gave favorable guidance for the remainder of its fiscal year. With many clients seeking to improve electronic design and tap into  , software security, and quality solutions expertise, the company sees plenty of growth opportunities stretching even further into the future as well. Investors seem excited about those prospects and the positive impact they could have on the stock.Finally, shares of FireEye jumped 6%. The cybersecurity company was extremely valuable in helping a couple of key clients identify disinformation campaigns from Iranian and Russian sources, according to reports, with  's Google joining previous efforts from  and  to delete social media accounts. Propaganda and other influence campaigns have become increasingly important threats both to the U.S. generally and to the social-media companies on whose platforms such campaigns often appear, and investors are now seeing the value of the services that FireEye can provide in identifying those threats in time to minimize or nullify their negative impacts.

ynopsys (SNPS) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.92 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.92 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.26%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of software used to test and develop chips would post earnings of $1.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.08, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Synopsys, which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $779.71 million for the quarter ended July 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.66%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $695.38 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .Synopsys shares have added about 10.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.1%.While Synopsys has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Synopsys was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.71 on $764.52 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.81 on $3.09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Software is currently in the top 21% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

"ome cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in value in recent years. While riding that wave on the way up can be fun, it's important for crypto speculators to remember that cryptocurrencies are also prone to  , too.Knowing that, we asked a team of Motley Fool contributors to share a stock that they believe holds explosive growth potential but is much less risky than crypto assets. Here's why they highlighted  (NASDAQ: SNPS) ,  (NYSE: BBY) , and  (NASDAQ: NVCR) .Image source: Getty Images. Instead of buying bitcoin, take a look at electronic design automation specialist Synopsys, which builds the tools that chip designers use to make their chips. On top of that, Synopsys also develops intellectual properties that chip designers can license and incorporate into their chip designs, which saves those chip designers from having to reinvent the wheel.One trend that benefits Synopsys is that many companies are starting to design their own chips.""We see new chip and systems companies entering the market, as big data and [artificial intelligence] are driving new computer and chip architectures optimized for machine learning,"" Synopsys CEO Aart de Geus said on the company's May 23 .Synopsys isn't just making pie-in-the-sky promises about the future, though. The company said that its revenue from electronic design automation tools ""continues to outpace the competition"" (suggesting share gains) and revenue from its intellectual property ""continues its double-digit growth.""This all seems to be translating nicely into tangible financial results as the company says that it's ""on track for a record revenue and earnings year."" Synopsys' revenue guidance for the year is between $3.07 billion and $3.1 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share expected to come in between $3.76 and $3.83; at the midpoint of each of these ranges, Synopsys' revenue and earnings-per-share growth would be 13.2% and 10.9%, respectively -- both representing good growth.The stock isn't super cheap -- it's trading at around 23.54 times the midpoint of its non-GAAP revenue guidance -- but considering its strong execution and the opportunities that seem to lie ahead for the company, the shares still seem worth a look. Six years ago, consumer electronics retailer Best Buy looked like a risky stock. Not as risky as bitcoin -- few stocks are. But Best Buy was struggling, and it desperately needed a change of course.Fast-forward to today,  . Under CEO Hubert Joly, the company has completely turned itself around. Best Buy has made its prices more competitive, slashed unnecessary costs while investing in customer-facing labor, and greatly improved its e-commerce business. It's a true omnichannel retailer, leveraging its stores for online order pickup and for fulfilling some online orders.The results are nothing short of miraculous. During the first quarter, for example, comparable sales surged 7.1% and adjusted earnings per share jumped 37%. The company is using its rock-solid balance sheet and ample free cash flow to buy back a boatload of shares, with plans to spend at least $1.5 billion on share buybacks in fiscal 2019.Those buybacks are good news for investors because the stock isn't all that expensive. After backing out the net cash on the balance sheet, Best Buy stock trades for around 14.5 times the midpoint of the company's fiscal 2019 guidance for adjusted earnings.Best Buy's growth won't remain this strong forever. Slowing demand for smartphones could put a dent in the company's growth rate, as could tariffs that push up prices for TVs and appliances. But given the valuation and Best Buy's track record under Joly, I think the stock is a good bet. The biggest draw of crypto assets is that they hold  upside potential if they eventually go mainstream. That's why I think that NovoCure is a good substitute for these types of investors because the company holds a similar amount of upside potential.NovoCure is a medical device company that is focused on cancer. The company discovered that electric fields can be used to  and created a product called Optune to commercialize this property.Optune is currently FDA approved to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is a deadly form of brain cancer. Just over 2,100 patients were actively using the device to fight the disease as of the end of June. That might not sound like much, but that small patient population translated into $61.5 million in total revenue last quarter.What's exciting about Optune is that the device has barely scratched the surface of what's possible. More than 12,000 patients are diagnosed with GBMin the U.S. each year. The number gets even bigger when you include the rest of the world (the company is actively selling Optune in Germany, Japan, and Austria).The opportunity ahead in GBM remains large, but the most exciting thing about NovoCure is that studying Optune in several other types of cancer such as lung, pancreatic, ovarian, mesothelioma, and more. To give you a sense of scale, about 300,000 Americans are diagnosed with lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer each year.It remains unknown whether Optune will ever win approval in any of those other disease states, so NovoCure is a riskier-than-average stock. However, the opportunity ahead is so large that I believe this company is still a great choice for risk-loving investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and NovoCure wasn't one of them!

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $69.64 per unit.With QQEW trading at a recent price near $63.05 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.46% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are (Symbol: LBTYA), Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), and Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS). Although LBTYA has traded at a recent price of $28.16/share, the average analyst target is 40.50% higher at $39.57/share. Similarly, INTC has 11.75% upside from the recent share price of $51.98 if the average analyst target price of $58.09/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting SNPS to reach a target price of $102.00/share, which is 11.15% above the recent price of $91.77. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LBTYA, INTC, and SNPS:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The Math Shows QQEW Can Go To $70@2018-07-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/math-shows-qqew-can-go-70-2018-07-20
" recently announced that a host of its solutions has been selected by Arbe Robotics for its patented imaging radar meant for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.Arbe Robotics' imaging radar has a high resolution and offers a ""wide 100-degree field of view"" even in difficult conditions such as heavy rains, fog or extreme darkness. The chipset is enabled to support safe autonomous driving level 4 and 5 via capturing a detailed image of the size, location and speed of any object within a range of 300 meters of the vehicle.The company has adopted Synopsys' ""DesignWare ARC EM Safety Island, EV6x Embedded Vision Processor with Safety Enhancement Package (SEP), Ethernet Quality-of-Service (QoS) Controller IP, STAR Memory System, STAR Hierarchical System and STAR ECC Compiler for its new 4D high-resolution imaging radar system-on-chip (SoC).""The ASIL D Ready features of Synopsys' IP are suitable for the strict safety requirements of ADAS. Additionally, ""safety documentation, including failure modes, effects, and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) reports"" are anticipated to quicken the pace of the chip's ISO 26262 Certification.Notably, in May, Synopsys unveiled the industry's first ASIL D Ready embedded vision processor IP for applications in ADAS and autonomous vehicles. It provides critical hardware features for safety along with maintenance of high performance. We believe this will provide the company with first mover's advantage in the market, eventually driving revenues. | Discussions regarding ADAS and autonomous vehicles often veer toward the reliability and safety-oriented issues of the vehicles. In March, one of Uber Technologies' autonomous vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona, while undergoing test driving.Following this incident, the governor of Arizona suspended Uber from test driving autonomous cars in the state for an indefinite period. Reportedly, this mishap led NVIDIA  , the manufacturer of hardware for Uber's technology, to stop testing of its own self-driving vehicles on roads.Notably, NVIDIA is currently using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a virtual reality (VR) based autonomous vehicle simulator that enables the virtual testing of autonomous vehicles in diverse conditions. Hence, safety remains a major concern for the companies dealing with autonomous driving and ADAS.Synopsys' IP solutions are equipped with self-checking safety monitor, error correcting code (ECC) and programmable watchdog timer. Also, the lockstep feature enables rapid detection of runtime faults and system failures and addresses the need for real-time networking between the connected devices.We believe that such initiatives on Synopsys' part will eventually increase its client bases, thereby boosting its top line in the long run. These will also aid the company in competing against peers like Cadence Design Systems Inc  .Synopsys currently has a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).A better-ranked technology stock is Citrix Systems, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Long-term earnings growth rate for Citrix Systems is currently projected to be 9.1%.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is collaborating with Siemens PLM Software to jointly develop a wide range of electronic design automation (EDA) product interoperability projects.EDA is a category of tools used to analyze semiconductor devices. Many chip designers and manufacturers are opting for EDA, attracted by the reduced cost, errors and design time associated with its adoption.The increasing demand for EDA solutions are driven by growth in fast growing fields of cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and smart wearable devices.The synergistic collaboration between Synopsys and Siemens encompasses EDA domains from design to verification.The latest collaboration will help Synopsys address the needs of semiconductor and system-on-chip (SoC) manufacturing firms, which comprises the majority of its clientele. Moreover, the joint solution will enhance customers' digitization efforts.Further, the collaboration will ensure more effective EDA solutions for mutual customers.Notably, one major competitor of Synopsys was Mentor Graphics, which was recently acquired by Siemens. The companies have also settled all outstanding patent litigationsHence, we believe the collaboration with Siemens on EDA product interoperability solutions bodes well for Synopsys, as it will expand its penetration in the market. | We believe Synopsys will benefit from its expanding partner base. The company's extended relationships with the likes of AMD, Juniper, Realtek, Teradici, NetLogic Microsystems, Toshiba and Wolfson will continue to boost its top-line growth.Synopsys also collaborated with ARM Holdings plc which is expected to optimize the performance of its processors.The company is positive about its EDA design solutions which are helping in designing of new AI engines. The newly launched Fusion Technology has gained accolades from the Samsung, STMicroelectronics, Toshiba, and ANSYS.Further, strategic acquisitions have expanded the company's presence in the intensely competitive EDA market.Synopsys currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some stocks worth considering in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Adobe  , YY  , and Verint  . All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Long-term earnings growth for Adobe, YY and Verint is projected to be 16.20%, 26.43% and 10%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Inflow Detected - QTEC, CDNS, CTXS, SNPS@2018-06-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-inflow-detected-qtec-cdns-ctxs-snps-2018-06-15
 has been gaining from recent product launches, client acquisitions and buyouts. The company has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.8%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a current market cap of $13.3 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio right now.Let's take a look at the factors aiding the company's performance.Increased adoption of Synopsys' products, as well as strength in hardware segment and IP are aiding the company's growth, as evident from its second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues that jumped 14.2% year over year to $776.8 million. | Notably, the company is gaining traction from acquisitions. In January 2018, Synopsys acquired Kilopass Technology, a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. The buyout is expected to help Synopsys in offering a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions.Synopsys is also reaping the benefits of acquiring Black Duck Software, a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck's brand recognition as well as cross-selling options are proving to be accretive to the company's top line.Nevertheless, the company's escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the timeline for realization of acquisition synergies remain headwinds.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from peers like Cadence Design Systems  , which might result in lower prices and profits for Synopsys.Furthermore, the company has customer-concentration risk, as a small number of customers account for significant portion of its revenues. This could be risky, as loss of a single customer could affect its operating performance significantly and thereby jeopardize results.However, Synopsys' improving top line along with shareholder-friendly initiatives like the recent announcement of buying back $165 million worth of common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program make this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock worth retaining in the portfolio.Some better-ranked technology stocks include The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.  and Citrix Systems, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for The Ultimate Software Group and Citrix Systems is currently projected to be 21.7% and 9.1%, respectively.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

With that, I will turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I am happy to report that our second-quarter results were excellent. We delivered double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth. Revenue came in at $777 million, with strength across all product groups and non-GAAP EPS was $1.08.We repurchased $35 million of our stock, bringing the total so far this year to $235 million, and we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.The landscape around us continues to thrive, with semiconductor growth pegged at 10% plus for 2018. We see new chip and systems companies entering the market, as big data and AI are driving new compute and chip architectures optimized for machine learning. Substantial investments are being made as the AI digital intelligence push is increasingly evident in verticals such as automotive, medical, industrial, and growing networks of connected IoT devices.The automotive vertical is particularly interesting, as AI-enabled autonomous driving has the potential to revolutionize the very notion of car ownership while simultaneously requiring massive amounts of electronics and software in cars.These deep transformations rattle the well-established safety practices in one of the most sophisticated supply chains ever built, and software security is rapidly becoming paramount to shipping modern vehicles. Synopsys is ideally positioned in these evolutions. The three customer groups we serve -- semiconductors, systems companies, and software developers -- are all investing significantly in very advanced chips, massively complex systems, and large amounts of software. Consequently, it's imperative that they increase their efforts to test for or, better, pre-emptively avoid security vulnerabilities.Over our entire history, Synopsys has invested in the most advanced technologies, paired with unmatched global customer support and has been privileged to team up with customers who have changed the world.This is happening again now. Our EDA design solutions are helping design brand-new AI engines. Our IP is broadly used in the most advanced silicon technologies ever built. Our verification and emulation tools help bring up and test software on prototypes long before silicon is available.And our software security and quality tools assist in making that very software less vulnerable to threats.This quarter, all of our product groups did well. EDA revenue growth continues to outpace the competition and we've begun to roll out breakthrough digital design capabilities through our new Fusion Technology. IP continues its double-digit growth, driven by our broad portfolio that is already on pace to enable the 5-nanometer IP needed in the near future. And lastly, our software security and quality group, which has reached economic critical mass and is executing very well with the integration of Black Duck, continues to deliver excellent organic growth.Let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA.In Q2, our EDA revenue was strong across the board. Synopsys is the essential partner for the most advanced designs. Customers rely on us for more than 95% of their FinFET designs. Our track record at 7-nanometer is unrivaled, with nearly all of the 120-plus designs we are tracking impacted by our digital tools.At 5-nanometer, our deep collaborations with customers and ecosystem partners are resulting in early successes. Here too, customers are relying on Synopsys digital for nearly all designs. Our expertise and influence reach down to 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer, where we are already involved in preparing for still more advanced technology nodes. Foundry support and ecosystem partnerships are critical to enabling joint customers.During Q2, TSMC certified our full digital and custom flows for their 7-nanometer FinFET Plus and emerging 5-nanometer processes. Together with ARM, we announced a multiyear extension of our long-tenured collaboration, spanning all Synopsys tools, to best enable advanced ARM-based SoCs.In digital design, we saw revenue growth accelerate over the last two quarters. In 2Q, we announced our new Fusion Technology, which represents a completely new level of integration of our market-leading products in synthesis, place and route, and signoff. A systematic sharing of algorithms, code, and data representations across multiple tasks opens the door to previously unachievable levels of performance and quality of results by redefining conventional product boundaries.An example of the power of our Fusion solution is from Samsung Electronics, which experienced 10% better quality of results and significant reductions in turnaround time. They joined ST, Toshiba, and our product partner Ansys to share the benefits of Fusion Technology with fellow customers at our Silicon Valley user conference. Our digital design vision and road map are already driving expanding customer relationships, including a key long-term agreement with a very high-profile global systems company. We delivered strong growth in custom as well and launched an enhanced custom design platform, with 2 times faster simulation for FinFET and automotive designs.In verification, we continue to see outstanding results and a strong outlook for the year.Demand is high for our Verification Continuum Platform, built upon the fastest engines in the industry and our No. 1 position in both software- and hardware-based verification. Q2 was a record quarter for hardware. Customer adoption of ZeBu emulation was broad-based, with substantial growth in existing accounts and a competitive win at a top 10 semiconductor company, driven by ZeBu's significant speed advantage.Cambricon, a global leader in intelligent processors, adopted our FPGA prototyping solution for its AI processor product. HAPS-80 delivers the performance, capacity, and scalability needed to enable Cambricon to accelerate software development and system validation.Now to IP, which had another strong quarter and is poised for an excellent year, our strength is driven by multiple customers, regions and application segments. For example, several key agreements were for mobile chips focused on next-generation processes. We saw excellent success in cloud computing.A number of important deals were with automotive companies, for interface IP and our new safety-certified ARC embedded vision processor. And overall, business is strong worldwide, notably in China, where many companies look to third-party IP to maximally speed up their time to market. In order to ensure that the latest IP titles are available from Synopsys in the customers' desired manufacturing processes, ecosystem partnership and intense bleeding-edge investments are critical.During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with TSMC to deliver key memory IP and logic libraries for TSMC's 22-nanometer ultra-low power processes. We are also collaborating with Samsung Foundry to develop DesignWare IP for its 8-nanometer FinFET process, particularly benefiting low-power, high-performance applications.To address the growing needs in data-intensive applications such as machine learning, cloud computing and networking, we continued our investments in high-speed SerDes IP with the acquisition of Silicon and Beyond. At this point, it is worthwhile to note that we continue to make excellent progress in the automotive vertical as well. One of the requirements to participate in this market is product certification for a number of safety standards. We offer the broadest portfolio of IP that is certified for safety and reliability, ranging from embedded vision processors to embedded memories to the industry's widest selection of interface IP.In EDA, our design portfolio achieved the industry's most comprehensive ISO 26262 certification by EXIDA, the leading automotive functional safety certification company.Certification spans our custom, analog/mixed-signal, digital implementation, signoff, and library development flows and of course, automotive safety also implies software security, which brings me to our software integrity group, which serves a third customer base, software developers across many industries, including but also well beyond semiconductors and systems. We provide products and services that help developers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain. Software integrity is a key differentiator for Synopsys and has substantially expanded our TAMs. In recent quarters, we have reached critical mass with significant growth both organically and through acquisitions. Our software integrity platform is making good progress.We are step by step combining key technologies and will continue to roll out incremental advances over the next 12 months and beyond. We are excited about the very positive impact that our broad solution will have on our customers' efforts. The addition of Black Duck provides another compelling set of products addressing the ever-expanding open source content in today's software. While still early, the integration is proceeding very well.The combined team is energized, the road map planning is on track, we are benefiting from the brand recognition of Black Duck, and we are beginning to see some cross-selling benefits.Finally, for the second year in a row, Synopsys was named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for application security testing. The Magic Quadrant is an important indicator for customers, who often use it to narrow their list of potential vendors. We have seen a definite increase in our customer interest since first being recognized last year. To summarize, the company is hitting on all cylinders.We had a very strong quarter. We are raising revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. We are making excellent progress with our leading products in design and verification and our investments in IP and software have broadened our market reach, TAM and company outlook.Let me now turn the call over to Trac. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. In delivering another excellent quarter, we achieved record revenue with strong growth across all geographies and product groups. We delivered double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth and we returned cash to shareholders by repurchasing $235 million of stock in the first half of 2018.Based on the strength of first-half results and better visibility to an increasingly favorable second half, we are raising our 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance.Now to the numbers. As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year over year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 14% to $777 million, reflecting strength across our product portfolio. The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.6 years and we expect the annual average to be about three years.Total GAAP costs and expenses were $650 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $587 million, resulting in an operating margin of 24.5%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.67. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.08, a 23% increase over the prior year.We are in the process of preparing our 2019 plan and will not have more definitive guidance for next year's tax rate until after Q4. Based on what we know at this point, we currently expect our non-GAAP rate to be below our previous 19% but higher than our 2018 rate of 13%. Operating cash flow was $63 million for the quarter, including a one-time tax payment totaling $33 million related to our 2017 repatriation of offshore cash. We ended the quarter with cash and cash-equivalents of $571 million, 23% of which is on shore, and total debt of $524 million.We are committed to investing in the business to drive sustainable growth and managing our balance sheet to increase long-term shareholder value.In Q2, in addition to completing our previous $200 million ASR, we also repurchased $35 million of stock in the open market. On a trailing-12-month basis, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. We have $490 million available on our current repurchase authorization. Black Duck, which we acquired in Q1, has been a very successful addition to our software integrity group.It's on track to meet our 2018 target of $55 million to $60 million in revenue, which reflects a purchase accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $20 million. Consistent with previous guidance, we project Black Duck to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS and to reach breakeven in the second half of 2019. In addition, we closed two small acquisitions in the quarter that will enhance our photonic design and high-speed SerDes IP solutions.Finally before moving on to guidance, a reminder regarding the transition from Accounting Standard Topic 605 to Topic 606, which will go into effect for us in fiscal 2019 beginning in November, because of the new rules, we do expect a loss of backlog at the time of transition. However, based on our current estimates, we expect the impact on revenue to be immaterial.The precise impact will be affected by future bookings and business transactions through the rest of the year and we will provide more definitive commentary on our fiscal 2019 guidance.Now to the third-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance. For Q3, the targets are revenue between $760 and $785 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $669 million and $685 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $605 million and $615 million, other income and expenses between minus $3 million and minus $1 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%, outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.65 to $0.75 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.89 to $0.93 per share.For 2018, the targets are revenue of $3.07 billion to $3.1 billion, other income and expenses between minus $6 million and minus $2 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%, outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million, GAAP earnings of $1.66 to $1.76 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $3.76 to $3.83 per share, capital expenditures of about $110 million, and cash flow from operations of $500 million to $550 million. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2018, you will note that our guidance implies higher revenue in Q3 than in Q4. This reflects the inherent variability associated with hardware and IP and is based on our best visibility at this point.Earnings will also be higher in the third quarter, reflecting seasonally higher operating expenses in Q4. To summarize, we delivered our strongest revenue quarter to date and we are on track for a record revenue and earnings year. We continued to complement our investments in our core businesses with incremental spending in our newer higher growth products to support sustainable long-term growth. Finally, we have achieved these results while maintaining our commitment to a balance of organic investment, M&A and the return of capital to deliver strong results for our shareholders. Let me now turn it over to the operator for questions.[Operator instructions]. And our first question from the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Please go ahead. -- Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Let's just verify few things more so than anything. Your implied fiscal year '18 EPS guidance assumes I believe 500-basis-point sequential dip in operating margin and operating margin of the year is somewhere in the neighborhood of 22% on a non-GAAP basis.And you did, in fact, show 600-basis-point sequential dip in operating margin in the fourth quarter of last year and as you described it's a function of seasonally weak revenue and continued increases in opex, so should that be the way we normally model the way your fiscal year unfolds a large sequential dip in operating margin just given the away seasonality trends? -- Hi, Gary, this is Trac. For this year that's the case. It happens to be similar to last year but I would call that as a normal trend over time. It really depends on the quality profile of our business and so you will see variable comp or commissions accruals vary from quarter to quarter.As we said for this year given the revenue profile and our hiring trends and then what is an expected true-up for a variable comp in Q4, it just happens to be our lowest EPS quarter. -- You mentioned that Black Duck is roughly $0.12 dilutive in the current fiscal year and just doing some calculations, it looks like it's like 200 basis points operating margin dilutive and I am assuming there is some dilution contribution from the other two acquisitions, Silicon and Beyond and Phoenix and whatnot. Can you verify that's approximately the amount? Can you verify that may be operating margin in 2018 will be on par with what was in the prior year if not for the acquisition dilution? -- Your calculation on the operating margin impact of Black Duck is in the right neighborhood. In addition to that, we have also made some investments in IP and EDA this year given the opportunities that we are seeing in the market. With regards to the operating margin changes from year-to-year excluding the impact of Black Duck, it would have been up marginally or marginally flattish year over year. We do expect to drive operating margins to the mid-20s as we stated in the past.And as although we are in the midst of planning FY '19 right now, we do plan on driving it up next year. -- The last question, is the software integrity group still on pace for roughly $260 million revenue this year? -- You are in the right range. -- All right, that's it for me. Thank you.Our next question is from Rich Valera with Needham and Company. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Impressive increase in your annual revenue number there, $150 million, is there any other color you could give on kind of where that's coming from I mean, is it predominantly hardware or is it a mixture of all the products? And then just sort of looking at the incremental flow-through of that to the bottom line, it looks like it's kind of that about half of the implied corporate operating margin. So wondering what's going on there is there some incremental dilution from the acquisitions or are you doing maybe some incremental reinvestment from some of the upsides you expect to see on the top line? Thank you. -- From a growth perspective, there are three things. First, it was broad. Across the board, all businesses did very well and then I would say standing out beyond that was the IP and the hardware both did very well. It's a little lumpy as these things occur but at the same time I would say overall, these are healthy businesses.In terms of the ongoing management of the profitability, this has been absolutely been a year where we have made investments, we see opportunities. Black Duck, of course, has its own investment via M&A. And so I want to just state exactly what Trac was saying we did this on purpose knowing that we have great opportunities to grow well. And looking forward to '19 without giving specifics, we will pay more attention to the ops margin moving it up again. -- That makes perfect sense. And then just the service and maintenance revenue line this quarter, Trac, was this pretty strong as that, was there a meaningful contribution from Black Duck in there or can we kind of expect that line to stay at those levels going forward or is there any other color you could give on that? Thanks. -- Yes. So the consulting services business for software integrity is actually doing very well. However, the quarter-on-quarter increase was largely driven by the IP business, particularly the percentage completion revenues. -- Got it. That's helpful. Thanks very much, gentlemen.And we go next to Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Hi, this is Darren on for Farhan. My first question we kind of gone on this already a little bit but when we look at sort of your guidance for 2018 last quarter, you basically had implied second half '18 of down 10% year over year, and now we're gained probably about 10% up year over year. Could you give us some color again on what's changed your outlook and maybe provide some idea of linearity across your business segments? -- Yes. The starting point is that overall all the businesses are doing well, so that gives us very nice baseline for the year. But what really changed this quarter was based on the strength of the business that we booked in the first half and the visibility that provided to stronger IP and hardware revenues, that's why we are increasing the second half. But as those businesses grow both IP and hardware, we will see more variability in the business.And what we're providing right now is our best visibility of that. -- Got it. And then also sort of on the margin question again if I keep the gross margins and then sort of the SG&A flat and I see that R&D is probably where you could probably get more expenses, is it right to think that the R&D should go up in the second half, maybe up 17%, 18% when you look at half over half or should I be looking at expenses coming somewhere else in terms of diluting the margins as a seasonality? -- I haven't looked at the year-over-year increase. I can't quote the 72% increase that you are driving but we should see a combination of expense increases in R&D as well as the sales and marketing line as we ramp up both hiring those areas as well as the sales and marketing line, it's going to be a variable comp or commissions increase. -- Understood. And then final question on the Black Duck and software security platform. It's doing really well. I am curious a little bit about sort of the cross-selling aspects going forward.And then also do you see possible customers coming outside of the semiconductors in terms of just being interested in the software integrity platform overall? Thank you. -- Well, let me start with the end. Absolutely, we are seeing growth in the customer base that we knew existed but didn't touch in the past. And so remember when we started in this direction with the acquisition of Coverity, at that point in time, it was roughly 50-50 balance between semiconductor systems on one hand and software development in areas that were certainly not in our purview. That balance has continued to shift to become broader and broader as we touch very different segments be it from oil reserves to health to the financial sector as industrial you name it.And fundamentally, the problem of security vulnerabilities is really anywhere in software. And so from that perspective, we do feel that we have tapped in a broader TAM. The fact that the different acquisitions I think we're well chosen because they are so nicely adjacent and supportive of each other, I think you are starting now to prove itself true. And in the middle of that, Cigital added a service component that also allowed us to engage at high-leveling companies that were frankly looking themselves as to what they should be doing and by being able to provide multiple aspects of the solution, we are more attractive, we are low risk and we have sort of the steadiness of a large company that's going to be there for the long run.So I think it's fair to say that there are many open questions for the future but that all-in-all we are very happy with how this is developing. -- Got it. Thank you for your time.We have a question from Sterling Auty with J.P.Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. A couple of quick questions. First, given that you mentioned Black Duck couple of times, can you just give us what was the organic growth rate in the quarter? -- I am sorry, the organic business versus Black Duck? -- For the company and for the whole, so what was total organic revenue growth? -- Sterling, we don't break that out. -- OK. Usually, I think about hardware as having upfront revenue recognition, so you talked about the strength in both hardware and IP helping the revenue in the second half. Why is the hardware bookings from the first half spilling over? Was there an increase in lead times? -- No, typically hardware, sometimes you can ship if you have inventory ready to go or if you are expecting certain orders and they indeed came in at the right time. The challenge with hardware is that it is lumpy in terms of size and it is somewhat unpredictable in terms of timing and then the shipping is on top of that a function of availability and of the desire of the customer frankly too. So, all of these things is a grab bag of things that are all not quite predictable. I want to just come back to the previous question because I think it wasn't quite clear if understood the question.We certainly don't want to leave the impression that the organic growth rates of the software integrity business were not very good -- it was actually very good, just that we don't break it out anymore between M&A and the rest. What we have said in the past and it continues to be so is that we expect the profile of acquisitions to gradually become profitable in about an 18- to 36-month time frame. And so that's the other financial aspect to this and the overall growth rate of that business we have in the 20%-point neighborhood. -- Got it. And then one last one kind of following on question I think Rich asked. So based on the strength of hardware and IP and how that's impacting the second half business, how should we think about the different revenue line items, because one of the things that we have had I think more challenges in terms of forecasting, I think the total revenue estimates have been good, you have come in and beat but our mix of time-based license versus maintenance services etc., I think has been more difficult to kind of pin down and I think that's created some noise. So any help that you can give in terms of clarity to help us on those line items would be great. -- Yes, I'll talk in general. It won't be precise for some of the nuances of it but in general, hardware will typically show up in upfront line. And then on the IP business two-thirds of it is going to be time-based with the third being more upfront and then time-based you will see it in the time-based line as well as consulting with the services and maintenance line. -- Maybe the comment I would add to that, you must have heard at least in the last six or seven earnings releases that we used the term ""lumpy,"" more difficult to predict in terms of to that effect. None of these terms are negative in regard to the business but they do highlight a little bit to why we go into a year with a certain degree of caution in terms of how we predict it because in general, we like to be able to deliver what we guide toward. At the same time, if you look at the evolution of Synopsys over now quite a number of years and you just look at the revenue line, you see that it's fairly consistently going in the right direction. Even if from quarter to quarter, it may not be perfect or maybe a little bumpy, overall I think the company is in good shape. -- Understood. Thank you.We go next to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open. -- Thanks and good evening. Aart, let me start with hardware. In 2017 and now for the trailing 12 months it would appear that Synopsis's total hardware business, based on our calculations, were about half of the combined EDA Big 3 hardware when we look at emulation and prototyping together, in fact by quite a good margin on a trailing-12 basis. So when Mentor said that they were No.1 in emulation for Q4, that does seem to have been the case. My twofold question on that is first, what are you seeing in terms of the breadth of the hardware business? It's basically a concentration question. And secondly, are you seeing more and more customers taking -- or same customers -- taking both emulation and prototyping? So, that's the first part of the question. Thanks. -- OK. So, everything about hardware, I think the first comment is we are doing very well in this area and there is a reason for it. The reason is that the area of focus that we have zoomed in on is the intersection of hardware and software, specifically the notion of can you bring up the software, can you run the software in other words on hardware that doesn't exist yet and therefore you use a prototype such as an emulator or FPGA board or we have some other forms of that as well. And the answer is that is a growing need because both the complexity of the hardware and delivery times and the software that's running on the chips is demanding an earlier exercising of software and that is where we do very well.Our own sense is that yes, we have grown our market share and that we are in the lead but Mentor does not disclose its number.So, I don't know if they are doing something great and good for them if they do. In terms of the breadth of the product line, we have talked for quite a while about the fact that we have a verification continuum. So, the hardware pieces, emulation, HAPS boards are actually working very well in conjunction with our software tools, the simulator, the debuggers and so on. And yes, a number of customers tend to use multiple pieces and assemble them, because each one of these solutions has different characteristics, some are really good for running large amounts of software that are really good for directly interacting with real-life situations, for example, the HAPS boards would be that.And in that sense, we are a very complete solution and we do see both growths in depth and in breadth and in repeat business. -- The second question has to do with the next generation chips that you talked about in your prepared remarks for AI and so forth. Can you talk about any meaningful differences in terms of the consumption of your core EDA software in terms of mix and/or numbers of licenses for the next generation of chips? When you think about synthesis, power, timing, you name it versus what the leads would have been five, 10, 15 years ago for the then-hot generations of chips, any fundamental differences in any of those kinds of dimensions? -- Actually, not really, and this is one of the reasons we have articulated for a while that we believe there is the whole wave of new opportunities is actually great for semiconductors, because the minute you can get some AI algorithm to run and do something useful, the next minute you think boy, it's so slow, can I just make it faster? And so these chips will in no time drift forward to the most advanced Silicon Technologies. And by the way also too in a number of cases to the largest chips to be built, I mean, these are truly quite exceptional. Now, I want to quickly also say that of the many AI companies that are doing chips, they span a broad spectrum from super advanced to how quickly can we get something on the market for IoT that is using more established technologies that are narrower in their capabilities. And so I don't think it's actually all that different than the ways that we have seen in the past be in the computation age or in the mobility age or the networking.And there is no question that the foundries are very much focused on making sure that they continue to deliver increased transit accounts in smaller dimensions. -- Lastly, if I may, your press release refers to Synopsis hitting on all cylinders, which is I guess confirmation that you really are an automotive company now. When you think about the various pieces of the portfolio, can you rank the relative impact on each from automotive, in other words, you think the largest relative impact might be on, let's say, IP or SIG or core EDA, how would you think about that? -- Well, actually I can say that there are four areas that are touching it quite substantially. The design tools touch it because the chips have to ultimately be certified on ISO 26262 and a number of those chips have some very sophisticated timing and power demands. The verification most definitely touches it and will touch it more as prototyping in the cars is going to be absolutely necessary, because the complexity is growing so fast that unless they prototype much more, and that could be virtual prototyping to be really fast, they will not be able to ship the cars. The third area's IP, because in these new systems, there is a lot also interface IP, there is a number of embedded processors, those two, aside of having to be certified, are things that people just don't design themselves anymore, they put them in the chips.And last but not least, coming from above is our software integrity group, where the notion of security had a rude awakening a couple of years ago when the Jeep was hacked.And instantaneously, many decades of diligence around safety were put into question as people realized that they have sort of forgotten about the software. So in that sense, they are all moving forward. Lastly, to your well-pointed quip that we are working on all cylinders, I would like to say we are working on electrification of ourselves here and so hopefully it won't just combustion engine but we'll be autonomously running the company. -- Thanks, Aart.And we will go next to Monica Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. Aart, specifically in your comment, you kind of talk about AI application that's kind of one example of growth, maybe talk about what kind of use cases you are seeing in the market and how much revenue we could see from these applications going forward? -- Yes. I don't think that we can be very precise on the revenue partially because we wouldn't disclose it partially also because there are many companies that do many things and so it's a little bit subjective but there is no question that there is a lot of effort in a lot of chips and also that there are quite a number of companies that three years or five years ago did not exist. And that is certainly a good sign and maybe over time, some overheating of that as all of these things tend to be above all but at the same time, I think this is going be a long bubble, because the minute a company sees that they are not in the right direction, they will get absorbed by somebody else and the investments will continue. And so if you look at the used cases, there are quite a number of companies that are going sort of in the generic AI direction essentially trying to provide capabilities that could be used in the cloud, typically a full learning, some are very visible and so you certainly would know about an NVIDIA that has done extremely well in that but there are many others on the way.And then there is a large number of companies that are looking at the type of things that you could put on on the edge.So it's not the learning but the interpreting of the learned behaviors or learned characteristics and they range from all kinds of facial recognition, voice recognition, pattern recognition of course for autonomous driving and so on but also analysis of vibration patterns to see if machines are going to brake, identification of cracks inside of pipes. I think there is going to be a lot of very interesting creativity here and I believe that as fast as this is moving we are still very much at the beginning of this major phase. -- All right, thanks. And then I have operating margin question if I look back Synopsis like 10 years numbers like in 2008, revenue was somewhere $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and operating margins was like 23%, now fast forward 10 years, revenue has increased more than 150% to $3.1 billion, what you are guiding but kind of margins similar to slightly lower. I guess the question is when we are seeing some significant and great growth in revenue, why we are not seeing more leverage in the margins? -- That's a very good question. And so we have always said that if we needed to do it we would push growth above ops margin but I certainly set the price with the fact that it's time for us to put more emphasis on the ops margin going forward. I would highlight something else though. We have been a company that has attempted and I think being successful now twice in broadening our TAM for the long term and the first of those was in the early 2000s building the IP business, which is not a substantial part of our portfolio.And then four years or so ago, we decided that we would invest in what we see as a continuity from hardware into the software world and invested in the software integrity business throughout a number of acquisitions and also quite a bit of organic investment. And I would say that in 2018 we can say I think that has been successful.And so we are very grateful for that because that gives us some of the opportunity to touch many, many customers that before we have never had any interaction with. It gives a different level of stability to the company in the long term when you look at potential ups and downs in markets over many, many years. And in that sense, I think it has brought an outlook to Synopsis that is more in the many years' space than in the next year outlook.So in that context, your point raises the right issue, which is can we now improve the incremental improvements toward the profitability but I would like to highlight that we are actually very happy as to where the company is now based on those investments. -- Thank you so much, Aart.[Operator instructions]. We will go next to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for your question. A few kind of small ones. I guess I will start with the easy ones first.So just with the two quick acquisitions, you guys did, is it fair to assume that didn't contribute much to the July quarter guide, meaning that it's somewhere under 1% to the revenue line? -- Yes, Mitch, this is Trac. They were immaterial to the results. -- OK, perfect. And the second one I realize that people are going to poke around a bit on the operating margin line but am I doing this math correctly that essentially the core business is growing faster, because if I add $0.12 to your FY '18 guide, it looks like EPS is outpacing revenue growth, which implies that the core business is essentially expanding operating margins. Is that correct? -- There are a few things in the results. If you break it out, clearly you have highlighted the Black Duck dilution. We do have the benefit of the tax rate which we knew some of that benefit to investing back in the business and we have mentioned earlier that we have seen pretty good opportunity in the IP as well as in the EDA space. And so those things are some of the drivers of the operating margins but overall you separate all those things out, we are holding margins relatively flat year over year versus '17. -- OK, perfect. And then the last one just in terms of the chip complexity in the security side, so we are seeing more and more news about people essentially finding hardware hacks and things of that in the chips. So where exactly are you guys seeing the cross-selling? I mean is it basically the cloud vendors like Facebook or something like that or who exactly is a cross-selling opportunity for the software integrity plus the core EDA tools? -- Well, so we are talking two different cross-selling opportunities. The first one is actually within the software integrity space where the quality tools, mostly coming from Coverity, and the security tools, Cigital, Black Duck, and a few other acquisitions, they are starting to cross-sell quite nicely and it's becoming increasingly a very coherent domain. And you may have heard in the preamble that we will also continue to invest in gradually building a platform where all of these tools work better and better together. The cross-selling from the software security to the hardware security is a little bit less direct, it is much more brand positioning and understanding of the topic.And there we do have a number of opportunities to focus more mostly through the IP business. In creating security within that, we have encryption tools, we have capabilities to build a route of trust. And I think that area will gradually grow, because yes, hackers have figured out that hardware could be vulnerable too and a lot of companies understand this and now are investing and improving their solutions. And I think that will continue for many years. -- OK, perfect. One last small one, just on the IP business, that was running below corporate average, is there any sort of kind of revenue run rate you get to where the IP piece of the business would be essentially in line with the operating margins? -- Yes, we don't disclose the specifics. Structurally, it is certainly a bit more difficult in the IP, because IP is sort of a better cost between products and service business. There is a certain amount of customization. There is a number of things that we do early on for certain customers and their statement of works and that describes a little bit how that works but having said that, there is also no doubt that over the years we have gradually grown the ops margin nicely and actually certainly last quarter IP had a very high level of orders, actually the whole quarter was very strong from an order perspective and we see the steady state of our run rate growing again. -- OK, perfect. Thanks so much.And I will turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks. -- Well, I think at this point in time hopefully you've taken away that we had a strong quarter. The run rate is up. The business is looking quite solid for the second half of this year. And you got a sense of where we are looking at in terms of results for '18 and also the beginning of a sense of how we are thinking about '19, although we will hold back on further comments until we get a little bit closer.Thank you very much for your attention and your support. And as usual, we will be available for the Q&A afterward.[Operator signoff]When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ontinuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value,  , yesterday, announced that it is set to buy back $165 million worth of its common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. This initiative reflects the California-based company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.The company announced an agreement with Wells Fargo Bank NA in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.5-million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before Nov 1, 2018, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys' volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.ASR arrangements are key elements of the company's overall framework for enhancing investors' worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $905 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company has also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In April 2018, Synopsys approved an extension of the company's existing share-repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. In fiscal 2017, it repurchased common stock worth $400 million.Synopsys' financial strength enables it to continue with the buyback program. As of Apr 30, 2018, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $570.8 million. Its aggressive share-repurchase policies are anticipated to boost investors' confidence. Synopsys' strategy to return wealth to shareholders highlights its growth potential and stable liquidity position. | Other companies which have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Microsoft  , Apple Inc.  and Electronic Arts Inc.  .We believe apart from enhancing shareholders' return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors' confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The company is continuing with its investments in high-speed SerDes IP to address the needs of ""data-intensive applications such as machine learning, cloud computing and networking."" The acquisition of Silicon and Beyond is a testament to the fact. Management is also positive about the recently completed acquisition of PhoeniX, which will enhance the company's photonic design capabilities.Management stated that the company's total addressable market has increased largely due to the Software Integrity group that deals with software security. The buyout of Black Duck has further enhanced the company's capabilities in this respect, which is on track to reach the company's target of reaching $55 million to $60 million by 2018.Total non-GAAP costs and expenses was $587 million, up 14.4% from the year-ago quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.72.The company noted that the acquisition of Black Duck will be dilutive to its earnings initially but will be accretive over the long run. Management reiterated that the acquisition is expected to be dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS by 12 cents to touch breakeven in the second half of 2019.Operating cash flow is expected to be within $500-$550 million.In addition to these, the company initiated guidance for the fiscal third quarter as well.

Management is optimistic about the 10% growth predicted for semiconductor sector for 2018, which, in turn, will be accretive for the top line of this vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software for the semiconductor and electronics industries.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and customer addition will be beneficial for financials going ahead. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive its near-term performance.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.  are other concerns.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation  , sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

In the last reported quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 10%.The question lingering on investors' mind is whether this vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise this time.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.We believe the company's continued focus on introducing products, acquisitions and deal wins will continue to aid financials. The global support provided by the company and its unique intellectual properties are expected to boost results as well.The company's inorganic additions are accretive to its portfolio. Apart from enhancing the product suite, these acquisitions strengthen its market reach and drive top-line growth.Synopsys' recent additions include PhoeniX Software, Silicon and Beyond, Kilopass Technology and Black Duck Software, which are anticipated to boost the company's revenue generation going ahead.Additionally, the company's time-based license revenue model, which offers better visibility and predictability, is a positive for the company. It ensures effective renting of the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee.However, dampened margins pertaining to increased costs and expenses remain a headwind for near-term profitability.

For the Guggenheim Multi-Factor Large Cap ETF (Symbol: GMFL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $30.01 per unit.With GMFL trading at a recent price near $27.33 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.80% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of GMFL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Unum Group (Symbol: UNM), Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), and Centene Corp (Symbol: CNC). Although UNM has traded at a recent price of $49.51/share, the average analyst target is 16.03% higher at $57.44/share. Similarly, SNPS has 15.82% upside from the recent share price of $87.82 if the average analyst target price of $101.71/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CNC to reach a target price of $118.93/share, which is 14.84% above the recent price of $103.56.

 recently announced that its board of directors has replenished its ongoing share repurchase program to its limit of $500 million.Notably, the stock repurchase program has been in effect since 2002 and the allotted capital has been refilled depending on the availability of funds. However, Synopsys is not obligated to buy back any specific number of shares and the program may be terminated depending on the company's decision.In fiscal 2017, Synopsys repurchased stock worth $380 million. At the end of fiscal 2017, the company had $400 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization of $500 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company bought back $180 million worth of its common stock, following which the fund was refilled.According to the company, accelerated share repurchase (ASR) arrangements are an integral part of its overall efforts to enhance investors' worth. In fiscal 2017, the company either initiated or completed $325 million worth of ASR. Prior to that, in December 2015, it initiated a $200 million ASR program while in December 2014, it started a $180 million ASR program that was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.We believe that apart from strategic investments, the company's continuous focus on such shareholder-friendly initiatives will help the company's shares rebound going forward. Notably, Synopsys has rallied 16.1% over the past year, underperforming the 30.4% surge of the  it belongs to.NVIDIA and Western Digital have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 10.3% and 19%, respectively.Additionally, the company's raised fiscal 2018 guidance is encouraging. The company's recent acquisitions of Black Duck Software and Kilopass Technology are expected to boost the top line in the long run. Moreover, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics are other concerns.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation  and Western Digital Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

"t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have lost about 2.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SNPS due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Continuing its earnings streak for the eighth consecutive quarter, Synopsys reported stellar first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines, both, came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding stock-based compensation expenses and all one-time items) of $1.10, which came in 17% higher than the year-ago quarter's non-GAAP earnings of 94 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at $1.00.The company's fiscal first-quarter revenues jumped 17.9% year over year to $769.4 million and came ahead of the previously guided range of $740-$765 million. Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $751.4 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by increased adoption of Synopsys' products, strength in IP and hardware products, as well as the Black Duck acquisition. Apart from this, an extra week during the reported quarter also helped the company in generating more revenues. Excluding the extra-week effect, the company's top line grew 11% year over year.Aart de Geus, chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys, noted, ""Propelled by the evolving age of 'Smart Everything,' semiconductor and systems companies, along with software developers across many industries, are driving digitization and machine learning, which require more and more advanced chips, sophisticated hardware/software interaction and high levels of software security. As the Silicon to Software partner, our unique combination of leading technologies positions us well to participate in this dynamic wave of opportunity.""Segment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) came in at $662.5 million, up nearly 16.4% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues jumped 27.5% year over year to $106.9 million.Total non-GAAP costs and expenses flared up 21% on a year-over-year basis to $573 million. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, the same expanded 200 basis points (bps) from the year-earlier quarter to 74.5%. The increase in total cost and expenses were primarily due to elevated employee compensation and cost of goods sold.Synopsys' non-GAAP operating income rose 11.7% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $195.9 million. However, operating margin shrunk 140 bps year over year to 25.5%. Higher operating expenses impacted the operating results.The company's non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $169.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 16.9%.Synopsys exited the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $605.9 million compared with $1.048 billion reported at the end of the previous quarter. The decline was mainly due to the funding of the recently-completed acquisitions of Black Duck and Kilopass Technology.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Guggenheim Multi-Factor Large Cap ETF (Symbol: GMFL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $30.01 per unit.With GMFL trading at a recent price near $27.33 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.80% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of GMFL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Unum Group (Symbol: UNM), Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), and Centene Corp (Symbol: CNC). Although UNM has traded at a recent price of $49.51/share, the average analyst target is 16.03% higher at $57.44/share.

Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

 recently announced that its board of directors has replenished its ongoing share repurchase program to its limit of $500 million.Notably, the stock repurchase program has been in effect since 2002 and the allotted capital has been refilled depending on the availability of funds. However, Synopsys is not obligated to buy back any specific number of shares and the program may be terminated depending on the company's decision.In fiscal 2017, Synopsys repurchased stock worth $380 million. At the end of fiscal 2017, the company had $400 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization of $500 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company bought back $180 million worth of its common stock, following which the fund was refilled.According to the company, accelerated share repurchase (ASR) arrangements are an integral part of its overall efforts to enhance investors' worth. In fiscal 2017, the company either initiated or completed $325 million worth of ASR. Prior to that, in December 2015, it initiated a $200 million ASR program while in December 2014, it started a $180 million ASR program that was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.We believe that apart from strategic investments, the company's continuous focus on such shareholder-friendly initiatives will help the company's shares rebound going forward.

Moreover, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 57 cents.The company's fourth-quarter revenues jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million and came ahead of the previously guided range of $642-$657 million. Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $653 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products, along with strength in IP and hardware products. Notably, per the company ""Our three-year backlog grew approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion, reflecting very good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals.""The company initiated positive guidance for the fiscal first quarter. The company expects revenues in the range of $740-$765 million (mid-point $752.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was pegged at $669.1 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 98 cents and $1.02 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 85 cents.Synopsys has an impressive earnings surprise history.

ontinuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value,  last week announced that it is set to buy back $200 million worth of its common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. This initiative reflects the California-based company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.Last Thursday, the company announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association and MUFG Securities EMEA plc in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.8 million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before May 16, 2018, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys' volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.ASR arrangements are an integral element of the company's overall framework for enhancing investors' worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $705 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company has also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In June 2017, Synopsys approved an extension of the company's existing share-repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. In fiscal 2017, it has repurchased $400 million worth of common stock.Synopsys' financial strength enables it to continue with the buyback program. As of Oct 31, 2017, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.05 billion. Its aggressive share-repurchase policies are anticipated to boost investors' confidence. Synopsys' strategy to return wealth to shareholders highlights its growth potential and stable liquidity position.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the  to which it belongs to. Synopsys has returned 53.8% during the said time period, while the industry has gained 35.3%.Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc.  and Electronic Arts Inc.  .We believe apart from enhancing shareholders' return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors' confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.Nonetheless, the company's escalating costs and expenses, which are thwarting margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Adobe Systems Incorporated  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .The long-term expected EPS growth rate for Adobe is currently pegged at 17%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $79.76 per unit.With QTEC trading at a recent price near $72.32 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.29% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), Symantec Corp (Symbol: SYMC), and Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP). Although SNPS has traded at a recent price of $85.35/share, the average analyst target is 18.00% higher at $100.71/share. Similarly, SYMC has 12.17% upside from the recent share price of $28.23 if the average analyst target price of $31.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CHKP to reach a target price of $113.90/share, which is 10.91% above the recent price of $102.70. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SNPS, SYMC, and CHKP:Combined, SNPS, SYMC, and CHKP represent 8.26% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Excluding the extra-week effect, the company's top line grew 11% year over year.Aart de Geus, chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys, noted, ""Propelled by the evolving age of 'Smart Everything,' semiconductor and systems companies, along with software developers across many industries, are driving digitization and machine learning, which require more and more advanced chips, sophisticated hardware/software interaction and high levels of software security. As the Silicon to Software partner, our unique combination of leading technologies positions us well to participate in this dynamic wave of opportunity.""Segment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) came in at $662.5 million, up nearly 16.4% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues jumped 27.5% year over year to $106.9 million.Total non-GAAP costs and expenses flared up 21% on a year-over-year basis to $573 million. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, the same expanded 200 basis points (bps) from the year-earlier quarter to 74.5%. The increase in total cost and expenses were primarily due to elevated employee compensation and cost of goods sold.Synopsys' non-GAAP operating income rose 11.7% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $195.9 million. However, operating margin shrunk 140 bps year over year to 25.5%. Higher operating expenses impacted the operating results.The company's non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at $169.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 16.9%. | Synopsys exited the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $605.9 million compared with $1.048 billion reported at the end of the previous quarter. The decline was mainly due to the funding of the recently-completed acquisitions of Black Duck and Kilopass Technology. Accounts receivables were $499.4 million compared with $451.1 million recorded in the last quarter.During the quarter, the company used $59.4 million of cash for operational activities due to the aforementioned acquisitions. The company repurchased $180 million worth of its common stock during the quarter. It has remaining $200 million for its current authorization.During the quarter, Synopsys completed the acquisition of Black Duck Software - a leader in automated solutions for securing and managing open source software - which opened up opportunities for generating additional revenues in the reported quarter. The addition of Black Duck's Software Composition Analysis solution will enhance Synopsys' product offering and expand customer reach, consequently boosting the top line.Apart from this, in the first quarter the company also acquired Kilopass Technology - a provider of one-time programmable (OTP) non-volatile memory (NVM) IP with applications in automotive, mobile, industrial, and Internet of Things (IoT) areas. This buyout will help Synopsys offer a wide portfolio of efficient IP solutions. The customers are anticipated to gain from the combined force of the two companies, while the robust portfolio is expected to be a top-line booster for Synopsys in the near future.Buoyed by splendid quarterly performance, Synopsys raised its fiscal 2018 outlook. The company now expects 2018 revenues to be in the range of $2.92-$2.95 billion (mid-point $2.935), up from the earlier guidance range of $2.88-$2.91 billion (mid-point $2.895). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.90 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $3.76 and $3.74 (mid-point $3.705 per share), up from the prior projection of $3.46-$3.53 (mid-point $3.495 per share). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.51.The company noted that the acquisition of Black Duck will be dilutive to its earnings initially but will be accretive over the long run. Chief financial officer of Synopsys, Trac Pham stated that, ""We expect it to be $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven in the second half of 2019, and be accretive thereafter.""Operating cash flow is projected in the range of $500-$550 million.In addition to these, the company initiated guidance for the fiscal second quarter as well. It estimates revenues in the range of $765-$790 million (mid-point $777.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $716.2 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses within $575-$585 million. Management predicts non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.06 and $1.05 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 83 cents.Synopsys started fiscal 2018 on an impressive note. Revenues as well as earnings improved year over year, mainly due to strength in hardware and IP products and benefits from the Black Duck acquisition. Additionally, the company's second-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance are encouraging.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results in the near term. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive its near-term performance. Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to consumers.However, escalating costs and expenses, which have been dampening margins, remain headwinds. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies and heightening competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics are other concerns.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation  and Intel Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .NVIDIA and Intel have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 10.3% and 8.4%, respectively.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus. -- Good afternoon. I'm happy to report another excellent quarter and, with it, another outstanding year for Synopsys. In Fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $2.725 billion, an increase of 12.5% non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.42, 13% growth, we generated $635 million in operating cash flow, our three-year backlog grew by approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion, and we bought back $400 million of our stock.These results extended our multi-year track record of strong growth with three-year CAGRs of 10% for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings. Accentuated by upside from hardware and IP, our business became stronger and stronger as we moved through the year, resulting in good revenue growth across all product groups and all geographies. The Fiscal '17 double digit non-GAAP EPS growth was achieved through both revenue growth and increasing operating margin, even with acquisition-related dilution.Simultaneously, we further scaled our Software Integrity solutions with good organic growth, the Cigital acquisition in Q1, and the planned Black Duck transaction announced earlier this month. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.As we assess the business we've built over the past 30+ years and look forward to the next 5 to 10 years, we're enthusiastic about our prospects. The market opportunity is vast and increasing, as we enter the age of ""Smart Everything."" Synopsys is well aligned to benefit from the emerging market dynamics.And, lastly, our financial position and priorities amply support our aspirations. Let me expand on these three elements of our value proposition. First, the age of Smart Everything, or Digital Intelligence, is here. Following the decades driven by Computation and then Mobility, Digital Intelligence is the third major wave of an electronics impact. Week by week, we can see its reach growing, be it through the internet of things, automotive, virtual reality, medical devices, or industrial.The need to manipulate massive amounts of data, apply AI through machine learning, while guaranteeing security, is unstoppable. All of this is made possible by an insatiable hunger for next generation advanced chips and complex software developed by our customers.Secondly, Synopsys is uniquely positioned at the very intersection of silicon hardware and software. Our design and verification tools are essential for the next generation of advanced chips and systems. Our growing, silicon-proven IP offering reduces risk and speeds time-to-market. In addition, our Software Integrity portfolio prevents code flaws from becoming security disasters.And third, we have maintained strong financial solidity while broadening our company TAM precisely for the opportunity at hand. Our recurring revenue model lets us consistently invest in advanced product development and support. We've managed our strong balance sheet and cash flow to enable both consistent stock buy-backs and TAM-broadening acquisitions, and we're driving shareholder value through long-term, high single-digit, non-GAAP earnings growth.Elaborating on our market and technical position, let me provide some highlights, beginning with EDA. With continued silicon and architectural sophistication, the success of next-generation chips is paramount in bringing about big data and machine-learning opportunities. Synopsys EDA continues to enable astounding levels of complexity, resulting in strong demand for state-of-the-art solutions across our product lines. Even with strong competition and continued customer consolidation, we've fared well, with growth outpacing the others over the past several years.We continue to strongly invest in our market-leading digital design platform. Our solution has been instrumental in enabling many firsts -- the first-ever 10 nanometer production design, the first 7 nanometer tapeout, and now significant activity on early 5 nanometer designs. The largest-ever FinFET design was implemented with the Synopsys platform, as was the largest networking processor in the world. Our digital platform is consistently trusted on the most advanced projects, and is relied on for more than 95% of all FinFET designs.Our success is particularly evident in applications such as mobile, automotive, CPUs, graphics, and AI-specific processors. And while we're seeing share gains with customers across industries ranging from networking to storage to sensors, automotive has been particularly strong with 9 of the top 10 automotive IC suppliers enabled through the Synopsys platform. Notably, at a leading automotive IC supplier, we're growing and displacing the competition.Meanwhile, the move to smaller geometries continues. New manufacturing approaches, new materials, and new innovative transistor structures require our 3D TCAD expertise to develop them.In Q4, we announced the acquisition of QuantumWise, whose amazing atomic-level simulation tools enhance our ability to model the most advanced next-generation devices. In custom and analog mixed-signal design, our Custom Compiler and Circuit Simulation not only demonstrated excellent technical results, but saw good revenue growth during the year. Customers such as MediaTek, Renesas, Panasonic, ST and TDK/Micronas have reported very successful deployments and tapeouts using our Custom Compiler solution, which is targeted specifically at FinFET designs.Now to verification, which continues to be an area of strength and growth for Synopsys. We realized a number of years ago that, as chips and systems became more and more complex, verification would increasingly be required at the intersection of hardware and software. Over the last years, while collaborating with market leading customers, we developed a comprehensive verification platform that excels at exactly that. In Fiscal 2017, our investments have resulted in another outstanding year of growth and share gains.One example is Samsung SARC, which chose our Verification Continuum -- including simulation, formal, emulation, debug and verification IP -- as the primary solution for their advanced mobile processor designs. Strong customer adoption of our hardware verification products drove another record year as well.Among high-profile customers presenting at the Design Automation Conference in June, AMD highlighted its use of our ZeBu emulation for early software development and bring-up. For software, emulation speed is critical, and ZeBu is the fastest solution in the market. In Q4, we saw another example of the huge potential for our emulation. A mobile giant, faced with verification challenges inherent in software-rich mobile platforms, adopted ZeBu, citing its performance superiority.Turning to semiconductor IP, we had another excellent year of double-digit growth. Over the past 15 plus years, we've built the broadest portfolio of IP titles and subsystems, and have become a trusted partner and market leader. Our foundry relationships and active drive in standards groups ensure that customers can buy leading-edge products in key technology processes at the earliest stages.During 2017, we further expanded our portfolio, with continued focus on automotive, IoT, and security. We expanded our IoT offering with our new ARC Secure IP subsystem for endpoint security, and our IoT Development Kit to accelerate software development for sensor fusion, voice recognition, and face detection designs. We announced a collaboration with Morpho, a leader in digital security and identity solutions, to accelerate deep learning processing for embedded vision applications.In Q4, we acquired Sidense, adding one-time programmable non-volatile memory IP, which is used in automotive and IoT, among other markets. Our IP group has been a beneficiary of customer consolidation, providing outsourcing options to companies who want to target their limited engineering resources more toward differentiating their projects.Let me next move to our Software Integrity Group, which provides products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain. Customers for these solutions span semiconductor and systems companies, who are embedding considerable software content into their chips and devices, all the way to developers of software in industries such as financial services, medical, automotive, and high-impact industrial.Over the past three-and-a-half years, we've become a clear leader in this emerging, high-growth industry. Since our initial entry with the acquisition of Coverity, we've invested both organically and through key acquisitions to develop a product platform and services to better serve companies deal with daunting ""software security problems.""As we gain scale and credibility, our brand recognition continues to strengthen. Gartner ranks Synopsys now as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. During the year, we made good progress integrating the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, and are now seeing a positive impact on demand. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Black Duck Software, the leader in testing open source software for known security vulnerabilities and license compliance.With open source making up 60% or more of all applications, this capability is critical to deliver a robust platform. Initial customer reaction has been great, as they recognize the benefits of combining Black Duck's highly respected capabilities with the broader Synopsys offering. The acquisition is scheduled to close shortly, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions. Our vision and investments are resonating well with customers, and we're excited about the long-term potential of this product group.Lastly, I've mentioned a number of vertical markets this afternoon. One key vertical that is going through momentous change, and is directly impacted by our end-to-end solutions, is automotive. Let me provide some highlights resulting from our multi-year automotive strategy. Because safety is So, critical, the automotive industry requires certification of products up and down their value chain.We've significantly expanded our portfolio of products certified for standards such as ISO, 26262, including our functional safety test solution, which was certified in Q4. During this year, we've massively expanded our industry-leading automotive grade IP offering, including a broad portfolio of Interface blocks that meet stringent automotive temperature requirements for the 16-nanometer FinFET process.In Q4, we extended a multi-year Automotive Center of Excellence collaboration with NXP, enabling early software development for next-generation electronic systems. We're also, well-recognized in the industry, serving as a leader on the Society of Automotive Engineers' Cyber Security Task Force, focused on driving new standards for software security.In summary, for Synopsys, Fiscal 2017 was an excellent year, positioning us well going forward. We achieved outstanding financial results, with revenue strength across the board. Our EDA and IP products are delivering top-notch results for customers building chips to bring about the Digital Intelligence, ""Smart Everything"" age, and we're making significant progress in scaling our software security platform and market leadership position. Let me now turn the call over to Trac. -- Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. To echo what Aart said, our strong finish in Q4 capped an outstanding 2017. This year's success reflects our commitment to deliver solid financial results in the near-term, while simultaneously creating sustainable growth and profitability over the long-term.Over the last three years, we have continued to expand our leadership in EDA and IP, while also, broadening our portfolio with our Software Integrity solutions. We are executing very well on our strategy, which is reflected not only in the broad-based strength of our financial results, but also, in the expansion of our Software Integrity business group with the announced planned acquisition of Black Duck. Based on our recent performance, the strength of our portfolio, and the backlog coverage heading into Fiscal '18, we are optimistic about our ability to drive sustainable success in the coming years.As I discuss the financial highlights, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. We delivered total revenue of $697 million in Q4 and $2.725 billion for the year, an annual growth rate of 12.5%. Business was strong across all product groups, particularly hardware and IP. In addition to another record year for hardware, our Q4 results included approximately $30 million in revenue from a large hardware shipment that was planned for 2018, but shifted into Q4.Our three-year backlog grew approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion, reflecting very good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals. We again have a large proportion of 2018 revenue, approximately 75% already in hand, providing stability and predictability not often seen in enterprise software companies.Total GAAP costs and expenses were $605 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $566 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year. 2017 expenses increased due primarily to higher costs associated with acquisitions, employee compensation, and cost of goods sold for hardware sales. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 23.8% for the year, even with the modest dilution from our Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions.We posted GAAP earnings for the year of $0.88 per share, including a loss of $0.80 in the quarter, reflecting the one-time impact of our repatriation of offshore cash, which I'll talk more about in a moment.Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter and $3.42 for the year, an annual growth rate of 13%. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 had the benefit of a hardware-related shift, which was the primary driver of the $0.11 overachievement versus expectations. Even excluding this upside, we delivered annual EPS growth of 10%, exceeding our original target.We generated $185 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, and $635 million for the year. We significantly exceeded our original 2017 target due to strong collections and business levels throughout the year, as well as $30 million received from A Top Tech for litigation damages.During the quarter, we initiated the repatriation of $825 million of offshore cash, taking advantage of our R&D tax credits and resulting in a cash tax rate of approximately 6%. This resulted in a GAAP-only tax expense of $166 million in Q4, and will drive a one-time cash tax payment of approximately $40 million in early 2018.Also, affecting 2018 operating cash flow is a $65 million one-time payment to the Hungarian tax authority, in connection with an ongoing tax dispute. While we expect to prevail, we were required to make this payment as a condition for continuing our appeal. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, with 53% onshore, and total debt of $144 million.In 2017, we used about 70% of our free cash flow for stock buybacks. We repurchased $400 million this year, and over the past three years have repurchased close to $1.1 billion of our stock. We have $400 million remaining on our current authorization. Our current plan for 2018 is to use buybacks to keep share count roughly flat.Before providing 2018 guidance, let me briefly comment on the Black Duck acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval and closing conditions, but we expect will close in December. When closed, we will pay approximately $548 million net of cash. Due to a purchase-accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $25 to $30 million, Black Duck is expected to contribute roughly $55 to $60 million in revenue in 2018. We expect it to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the second half of 2019, and be accretive thereafter.Now to guidance: due primarily to an extra week in Fiscal Q1 and the profile of expenses, we expect first half revenue and earnings to be greater than the second half. Q1 targets are: revenue between $740 and $765 million -- which includes approximately $40 million from the extra week -- total GAAP costs and expenses between $625 and $641 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $560 and $570 million, other income & expense between minus $1 and $1 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.62 to $0.70 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.98 to $1.02 per share, including approximately $0.05 from the extra week.For 2018: total revenue of $2.88 to $2.91 billion, a growth rate of 6 to 7% -- excluding Black Duck, the total revenue target range is $2.82 to $2.855 billion -- other income & expense between minus $6 and minus $2 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $2.24 to $2.38 per share, or $2.68 to $2.80 excluding Black Duck, non-GAAP earnings of $3.46 to $3.53 per share, or $3.58 to $3.65 excluding Black Duck, capital expenditures of approximately $110 million, and cash flow from operations of $500 to $550 million. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects one-time cash payments totaling approximately $105 million.In summary, we are executing very well on our goal to drive long-term shareholder value. We reported outstanding results across-the-board in 2017 while delivering a high level of predictability with $3.7 billion of backlog and scaling our Software Integrity products with the acquisition of Black Duck.With that, I'll turn over to the operator for questions. -- Reta, are you there?Yes, ma'am, I am. -- We're ready for Q&A.So, if you would like to ask a question, I do have... I'm sorry, Gary Mobley, your line is open. Please go ahead, sir. -- Hi, can you hear me OK? -- Yes, thank you. -- Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. Trac, can you confirm whether or not the Software Integrity Group finished Fiscal Year 2017 and they're about $170 million and, with the contribution from Black Duck as you outlined in your guidance, can you give us a sense of where Software Integrity will be for Fiscal Year '18? And is there any quantifiable impact to ASC 606 implied in your Q1 and Fiscal Year '18 guide? -- Well, let me start with your first question on SIG. The numbers that you just describe for SIG is pretty consistent with what we had guided at the beginning of the year and, yes, we did achieve the goals that we outlined at the start of the year. Second part is we're not calling out the numbers for Software Integrity, specifically, for next year, but it is consistent with about 20% growth on an ongoing basis. And Black Duck, separately from that, as we mentioned, is in the range of $55 to $60 million in revenues for 2018. With regards to 606, we will be implementing 606 starting in Fiscal '19 So, that is not factored into the '18 guidance. -- Got you. Okay. And, Aart, this is somewhat topical, just given that we've seen that -- or we had -- the risk of the gathering, CIMEO gathering, this past week and So, I'm curious to get your perspective on the impact of this OpenRISC-V processor IP as it relates to your business and then, as well, does it drive away the, say for example, Compiler EDA sales? For you looking forward, is it a significant impact on that front, as well? -- Well, RISC-V is in its beginnings, but it is also, one processor among many being built right now but this is investing cap, being more general-purpose processor, and may be of high interest to some parties. But many people are focusing right now on the development of AI-specific processors and so, from our perspective as an EDA and IP provider, it's a little bit like, ""the more the merrier"" because we can support many people doing designs.And we expect many processes to be optimized, specifically, for the applications because the hunger for more speed will be So, high that just going to smaller geometries will not be sufficient and, therefore, people will say, ""Hey, if I can build processors that are narrower and just aimed at some application, I can make them faster."" And we're seeing, really, a plethora of companies investing in that. -- Thank you, guys -- appreciate it. -- You're welcome.Next on the line, we have Rich Valera, Needham and Company. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you. Aart, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the business got stronger as the year went on -- sounds like maybe each quarter got stronger. I'm wondering how much of that you would attribute to just general macro strength -- just global economy improving -- versus some underlying secular trends going on that are affecting the EDA industry, whether it's new areas you mentioned, all of the smart areas...? But do you think there's some things going on that are actually expanding the TAM of the traditional EDA market that are helping the business grow or do you mainly attribute it to just better macro? -- Well, I think the answer is yes, yes, yes, because there's no question that the overall global economy has done well, mostly, because all regions are reasonably solid and So, having those in unison tends to help things. Secondly, there's no question that semi-conductors have had a very, very strong year and, in all fairness, this is after a few years of not being particular strong, and So, these things tend to go up and down, but up feels better than down -- no question about that.And then, lastly -- and I think that that is actually the factor that will matter most in the long-term -- is that this move into this next wave of electronics, enabling the very notion that was poo-pooed in the '90s of artificial intelligence, and now it comes other a set of other names -- big data, machine-learning, digital intelligence, I like to call it Smart Everything -- that will drive a very broad consumption of semi-conductors because the amounts of data generated by IOTs and various forms of sensors are growing by leaps and bounds, and just think of any camera being billions of pixels being generated.Secondly, this data needs to be manipulated to machine-learning, which is extremely computer-intense and then machine-learning in terms gets interpreted in the utilization, let's say, inside of a car, for example. And then, on top of that, you need to add one more aspect, which is security. And security, there's a very, very big component of that in the software part of our business, but it also will impact hardware as a variety of security modules will get added. So, I think that that semi-conductor is really at the heart of enabling a whole new wave of impact and, therefore, would stay reasonably healthy just on that basis only. -- Great. Thank you for that. And a couple questions on Black Duck: can you say roughly what that was growing and if you think you can, perhaps, accelerate that growth rate? And, also, Trac, I'm not sure if you're willing to share how much revenue you expect to lose from the deferred revenue purchase accounting? Thanks. -- Oh, Trac can comment on some of the financials. Normally, we don't give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions. And, frankly, our first job is to always make sure that the company really lands well and that we can look at what are the upsides with them with Synopsys or for Synopsys with them -- that goes in both directions.Having said that, though, I think what is exciting about Black Duck is that they really have grown up and have impact to the whole aspect of software referred to as open source. And one of the biggest productivity increasers -- and this is true on chips with IT, I think it is true on software by virtue of reuse of software in open source software -- it is, of course, the fact that you can use software from many sources and assemble it quickly.There are quite a number of lurking dangers in that and there's a large catalog of known volatilities. And, when people integrate this open source code material and they don't pay attention to at least the vulnerabilities that are already known, I think that's grossly delinquent when thinking about building secure software and So, it is just a natural for us, as an extension of our focus on quality and security of software. -- Rich, the guidance for revenue for Black Duck is about $55 to $60 million for 2018 and then the deferred haircut is about $25 to $30 million. As for, Aart described the market, SIG, Software Integrity, we're expecting to grow in the 20% range and Black Duck has been doing very well. And then the market demand for the trends in that space would drive growth sub-lowly in that range. -- Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.Next on the line, we have Farhan Ahmad, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question. My first question is on autos. You talked about the growing opportunity in autos and, particularly, as it relates to ISO, 26262 and your role in IP there, So, could you just talk about how much exposure that you have to the auto market and what is your portion in both EDA and IP? -- It's actually a quite difficult question because, yeah, we touch many, many companies that are in the automotive space and we, ourselves, find it a bit challenging to know exactly what is in the automotive part and what is in the regular semi-conductor deliveries.Having said that, though, the reason I like to highlight automotive is because it is such a poster child for what big changes are happening in an industry that, traditionally, was very slow in the adoption of any super advanced technology and, certainly, semi-conductor technology. I highlighted, specifically, the fact that we had invested substantially in automotive -- certified IP in FinFet 16 -- because, three years ago, nobody in their right mind would have ever associated the words ""FinFET"" and ""automotive"" and, today, all of the big providers in the value chain are focusing on that because they need more computation inside of the car.And so, the investments that we've made are not only to provide the tools that are suited for designing and modeling what goes into a car, but, as you mentioned, that also, fulfill the existing standards that, initially, were all built up, really, for safety and only now are gradually being evolved toward security. And those are words that we can certainly deal with very well So, I think we're well-equipped to be a good provider in that value chain. -- Got it. And then the second question is on the Software Integrity side. Once you integrate Black Duck, the total Software Integrity part of the business will be larger than 10%. Do you think, at some point, you will start giving disclosures separately for the Software Integrity Business? -- Farhan, that's a very good question. That's something we will actively consider as we progress throughout the year. Our focus in the near-term, clearly, is to integrate that business and make sure that we can drive the growth that we've got planned for the year but, as we progress, we will look very closely at the amount of disclosure we want to provide, balancing between providing information, avoiding competitive issues, as well as, on the flip side, making sure that investors get enough insight into the business to evaluate the opportunities. -- Got it. And just one last question on the market share: you are growing significantly higher than some of your industry peers this year. Some of the strength, obviously, throughout the year, you've talked about hardware has been a big portion of the growth but, when you look at your quarter product portfolio and the Core EDA manufacturing, what are some of the areas that you're getting market share of in this year? -- Well, I'm always careful answering questions like that because, often, the claims get out of hand quickly. We have extremely competent competitors like Cadence and Mentor, obviously, out there the largest ones. In some areas, Cadence has been growing a bit stronger in digital design, we have been growing faster in verification -- things ebb and flow and go back and forth. But, in aggregate, as an industry, we're quite competitive because we have constantly developed technology that's at the leading edge. And so, I think I have nothing negative to say about any of the other companies. We are all striving to be good providers in a market that, right now, is doing very well and we've had the benefits of making a number of investments over the years that are paying off particularly well right now. -- Thank you. That's all I have.And, next on the line, we have Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Go ahead, sir. -- Hey, thank you. Hey, guys, this is Jackson from the Adiron for Sterling tonight. One question from our side: looks like the time-based licenses had a pretty significant spike up and you mentioned, Trac, the $30 million in revenue from a hardware shipment that was pulled forward in the quarter -- does that explain...? I don't think that that would necessarily explain all the shifts in time-based licenses, So, we're just trying to triangulate the two. -- Well, Jackson, actually, it doesn't drive -- the hardware would not drive -- the time-based products. And keep in mind that we do look at that over time and it could vary from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the nature of the contracts -- royalties can also, fall into that, as well. So, there's really no issues within the quarter and that's not related to hardware at all. -- Okay. So, what was it, then, that drove the sequential increase? -- Overall, the business was very strong. You look at the growth across -- the geographies are crisscrossed -- different products across the number of top customers. We have very solid growth So, there's any number of things that can drive it. We did end the year with very strong run-rate growth So, the business is very healthy. -- Okay. And then one quick follow-up: the expected 2018 revenue that is expected to come from the backlog, dip down to 75%, is that mostly because of Black Duck or is there something else we should be reading into? -- No, it's really a function of hardware. As hardware gets to be a larger part of our business, it changes that mix a little bit. Excluding hardware, we're running generally in the same percentage as we have, historically, So, there's been no change to the business model with that regard. -- Okay. Alright. Thank you.And, next on the line, we have Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities. Your line is open.Thank you. Good evening. Aart, in the perspective of strengthening of the business over the course of the year, would you say that was correlate, more or less, in real-time to the positive inflection that we've been seeing for the last three or four quarters in semi-conductor R&D spending? That's your principal source of revenue and it's clearly been trending higher for the industry over the last number of quarters and, perhaps, that's what you saw over the course of the year in real-time in terms of unscheduled business, or for software or IT or, as you pointed out, accelerated hardware or might there still be a lagging effect from semi R&D that we'll begin to see more in 2018? -- Well, a little bit... Everything that you said is true, meaning that there's no question that, when your customers do really well, they are a little less hesitant in spending money and semi-conductors have been doing extremely well and are expected, right now, to continue for a bit.At the same time, our solution in the verification space -- overall verification platform, which includes the emulation and the FPGA prototyping boards -- has done very, very well. And this is not completely a surprise, but somewhat difficult to predict in timing because it follows what we had said, which is the center of gravity between hardware and software is going to increase in importance as more complex software people want to run the software before they have the hardware and, therefore, they model the hardware and that's the basis that we're in.The third aspect I would mention is that our IT business has been very strong and that is definitely partially the result of continual investment in the most advanced nodes, which is difficult IP to do and, as you probably know, the advanced nodes keep rolling out at a rapid pace because the providers are very competitive with each other.And, last but not least, the Software Integrity platform, So, far, I think is living up to our hope and expectations to be a good pillar for the company that is, on one hand, completely adjacent to what we already do -- both in terms of technology, and complexity, and, in many cases, in embedded situations -- on the other hand is clearly a fresh stamp for us as we're talking to customers that, in the past, we would never have dreamed of interacting with. Jokingly, I sometimes say, ""We now have customers from Samsung to Starbucks,"" and the fact is it's actually true. And So, that is a very big opportunity space.When you think about the Black Duck acquisition, can you talk about how you're thinking about integrating it in terms of technology with the other parts of the same portfolio and/or, perhaps, your thoughts on integrating the Software Integrity portfolio, in any case, with, let's say, your hardware-based prototyping to expand your overall concept of system verification and So, forth? -- This makes for a very long discussion because we are now very, very rich in technologies in this domain. And this is a domain that has been extremely fractured in the past and we're already starting to get, I would say, very strong positive feedback from a number of CIOs or people that are responsible for the security of software that being able to interact with a company that has a longevity and some mass gives them better feeling of security that we're going to be around.That's just another way of saying there's a lot of work ahead and we are continually integrating capabilities, but it is after we really understand them well. And So, an integration is really a two or three-year process at many different levels. Having said that, Black Duck resonates very well with many of our customers and they understand immediately that doing some automatic checks on software that comes in from, right off, not always understood sources is a good defense mechanism that they need. And So, I think that we will be well equipped with them to drive this area forward.Alright. Fair. Last one, for Trac, with respect to the $30 million accelerated hardware revenue into Q4, could you comment on the relative contribution from either Zebu or Halves in that? Was it more one than the other? And then, similarly, it looks like you also, had some quite good upside in the IT business -- was that more from services than IT product? -- Okay. So, let's start with the first one which is easy. We won't give more detail on the hardware. We'll leave it at hardware for now. But for the year, we actually did very well on both Halves and Emulations so, as I said, it was very broadly... this is broadly strong.As for IT, it was a combination of services and products.Great. Thank you.Next on the line, we have Monika Garg with KeyBanc, Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is, if I take out the $40 million revenue, extra week, and $55 million from Black Duck, it seems you are guiding to organic growth -- without those two companies, you're about 3% to 4% -- in spite of the fact that you just talked 20% growth in your software security business. So, why such a low growth if I take out these extra two stuff from 2018 guidance? -- Well, actually, if you actually did the full numberization, taking into account that we had $30 million that was planned for 2018 that shifted to Q4, you do the math that you just did on Black Duck and we've got mid single-digit growth on revenues and we're actually growing earnings per share on a high single-digit basis. So, I think, as we continue to describe, we're really running this business over a multi-year period and, in this particular quarter, you're getting a very high sense of that because, in one month, you're seeing a very significant shift in revenues. And So, it's best to look at our business on a multi-year basis and, if you go back and look at the charts for revenue growth and earnings growth, we've done a pretty good job executing against that. -- Alright. So, if I look at the MLD on the software securities side last week or what you have done, you've spent almost $1.2 billion. Could you walk through how you look at the ROI from these investments? What are the free metrics you're looking to generate over the next three to four years? Thank you. -- Well, for starters, we always start to look at this via a multi-year perspective because, acquisitions like that, they take some time to integrate, they have haircuts, they have a number of complexities on the financial side that need to be understood on the longer-term perspective. We have, actually, a longer-term well-honed process of trying to understand the value of the acquisition based on the cash flow that comes out of it over many years. We don't disclose the exact metrics, but we have a fairly good discipline for that.We review this for many years after the acquisition with our board, always with some up and some down surprises, which is another way of saying it's always difficult exactly to predict, but, in aggregate, it has been part of how we continue to create value for the company. And, in that context, Black Duck is not an exception.Our own sense is that this is a particularly valuable acquisition because of the strategic position it fills, technically, in the portfolio, but also, because of the very acute value it can create by reducing the risk profile for customers. So, that is the process that we follow. Nothing is perfect and I'm sure we can always do better, but we do have a long-term experience that has worked out pretty well for us. -- Alright. Just last one on the software security side again, most of the customers of software security are still are still in financial industry software so, maybe, talk more about your seal strategy, especially given the Black Duck acquisitions -- would you need ramp seal them up something more or would you look to develop channel for this segment? -- Well, that's an excellent question because there's So, many opportunities. And your commentary is partially correct in that, when we did the Cigital acquisition, Cigital was particularly focused on the financial sector. At the same time, my mentioning earlier of the automotive sector was interesting because those people are just as interested in the issues of security and software as anything else.There are other areas that are also, highly paranoid about what can happen -- medical is a good example and you've seen some really horrific hacks happening there -- and So, I think, over time, no area, no vertical is immune to the damages that can be done, essentially leaving the software doors wide open for hackers. And so, this is going to become more and more a must-do everywhere but, clearly, the sectors that are most sensitive are also, the ones that have been most attacked. And the financial sector, it quickly goes to the bottom line because the attack means trying to steal money and that brings a very rapid reaction.So, we are prudent in investing in verticals because each vertical requires skills, it requires understanding the vocabularies, it requires understanding who to interact with, but I think our opportunity space will continue to grow. And, with this part of our company broadening, we will put some more effort into understanding what are the best channels to do that but, So, far, I think we've been executing reasonably well. -- Thank you So, much.Ladies and gentlemen, once again, if you do wish to ask a question, it's * then 1 on your touchtone phone. If you hear a tone indicating you're in queue, if you want to remove yourself, just hit the # key again. Once again, * then 1. And here comes our next question from the line of Mitch Steves, RBC Capital Markets. -- Sorry I had two for Aart and I have one for Trac. So, I'll start with Aart: from a higher perspective, I believe the Black Duck have talk publicly about $5.6 billion TAM and then you guys have talked about a $2.4 or so billion TAM with your original acquisition. So, maybe you could give us a broad update of that? And then, secondly, is this the last transaction you need to get all the full capabilities in the Software Integrity business? -- Well, let me go backwards. We continue, of course, to always look at opportunities. At the same time, it's also, important to make sure that we execute well on the integrations of the acquisitions that we've done So, far and, while we have a number of teams that are extremely skilled at this, every case is different and So, they take some time. And what is also, interesting is that, as we bring new members to our team, they bring fresh perspective -- I like to call it ""fresh DNA"" -- that allows us to sharpen how we think about the field.To be honest, on your TAM question, I read the same reports that most people do and I'm equally skeptical if the number reflects any reality because, when you have a very rapidly developing market where there are many, many different very fractured companies, that typically indicates that there's a high need and that the need is still not satisfied or still in development. And those are actually all positive words because that's just coming opportunity, but it also, says that adding up whatever these companies have been able to do and then extrapolating is mostly a spreadsheet effort.And I don't want to be negative when people are trying to forecast it -- because it's important, of course -- but, from our perspective, right now, the size of the TAM is the least of our issues. I think we have open space to run with and our challenge is how quickly can we execute on this, not are there more customers to call on. There are many more. -- Got it. And, particularly, for Trac, a financial question: So, the small one is the Coverity and digital piece combined for Trac and that combined business, excluding Black Duck, being profitable on the back half? And then, secondly, is there any sort of way to track the health of the business, besides the quarterly update calls we get from you guys? -- So, yes, the numbers that we had discussed for the Software Integrity business was tracking to both revenue and profitability for this year. And then, as far as getting more updates on the Software Integrity business and progress there, I think we'll start with the quarterly calls -- that's a good start -- and then, throughout this year, as I said earlier, we'll evaluate how best to provide more insights to the analysts as well as to our investors on that business. -- Got it. Thank you. Great quarter.There are no additional questions in queue. Please go ahead. -- So, at this point in time, first a big thank you for having reported on us and supporting us during the year. Fiscal '17 turned out to be a very good year, not only from a results point of view but, most importantly, from the perspective of preparing us for the next few years. And, by now, it already feels a little old and So, we are fully proceeding on working on 2018 and hope to talk to you soon. As usual, we'll be available for individual calls in a few minutes.

"ontinuing its earnings streak for the seventh consecutive quarter,  , yesterday, delivered stellar fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom line both came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The results also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding stock-based compensation expenses and all one-time items) of 69 cents, which came in 10.4% higher than the year-ago quarter's adjusted earnings of 77 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at 57 cents.The robust year-over-year bottom-line performance was mainly driven by strong revenue growth and efficient cost management.Despite reporting strong quarterly results, shares of Synopsys fell as much as 3.4%, yesterday. This may be due to increasing operating expenses and declining operating margins.Nonetheless, Synopsys stock has gained 47.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 40.3% rally of the  it belongs to.The company's fourth-quarter revenues jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million and came ahead of the previously guided range of $642-$657 million. Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $653 million.On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products, along with strength in IP and hardware products. Notably, per the company ""Our three-year backlog grew approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion, reflecting very good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals.""Segment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $602.7 million, up nearly 7.1% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues surged 32.5% year over year to $93.9 million.During the quarter, Synopsys announced the acquisition of Black Duck Software, a leader in automated solutions for securing and managing open source software. The addition of Black Duck's Software Composition Analysis solution will enhance Synopsys' product offering and will expand customer reach consequently boosting the top line.Total non-GAAP costs and expenses increased 15.9% on a year-over-year basis to $566 million. Also, as a percentage of revenues, the same increased 430 basis points (bps) from the year-earlier quarter to 81.3%. The increase in total cost and expenses were primarily due to higher costs related with acquisitions, employee compensation and cost of goods sold for hardware sales.Synopsys' non-GAAP operating income was down 9.9% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $130.6 million. Operating margin also contracted 420 bps on a year-over-year basis to 24.1%. Higher operating expenses impacted the operating results.The company's non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $106.5 million, marking year-over-year decline of 10.5%.Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.048 billion million compared with $1.302 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $451.1 million compared with $411.3 million in the last quarter.During 12 months ended Oct 31, 2017, the company generated $634.6 million of cash flow from operational activities. The company repurchased $400 million worth of its common stock during the year. The company has remaining $400 million for its current authorization.The company reported fiscal 2017 revenues of $2.725 billion which jumped 12.5% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 came in at $3.42 compared with $3.02 per share for fiscal 2016.Synopsys provided the first quarter and 2018 outlook. The company expects 2018 revenues to be in the range of $2.88-$2.91 billion (mid-point $2.895 per share). Black Duck is expected to contribute approximately $55 million to $60 million revenues in 2018. Excluding the impact of Black Duck acquisition revenues are projected in the range of $2.820-$2.855 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.80 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are projected between $3.46 and $3.53 (mid-point $3.495 per share). Per the company ""We expect it to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the second half of 2019 and be accretive thereafter."" Excluding the impact of Black Duck acquisition non-GAAP earnings per share are projected in the range of $3.58-$3.65 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.59 billion.Operating cash flow is expected to come in the range of $500-$550 million.Apart from this, the company initiated guidance for the fiscal first quarter. The company expects revenues in the range of $740-$765 million (mid-point $752.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $669.1 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses within $560-$570 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 98 cents and $1.02 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 85 cents.Synopsys posted impressive fourth-quarter results. Revenues as well as earnings improved year over year, mainly due to strength in hardware and IP products. Additionally, the company's first-quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance are encouraging.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive near-term performance. Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to its customers.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Couple of better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are NVIDIA Corporation  and Intel Corporation  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see  .NVIDIAand Intel have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 11.2% and 8.4%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.1, after changing hands as low as $82.56 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 30.6. A bullish investor could look at SNPS's 28.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of SNPS shares:    Looking at the chart above, SNPS's low point in its 52 week range is $64.8621 per share, with $94.80 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $82.62.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SNPS makes up 2.67% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC) which is trading lower by about 4.2% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Synopsys Becomes Oversold (SNPS)@2018-02-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-becomes-oversold-snps-2018-02-08

 is set to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 29. The company has a decent earnings surprise history having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matching the same on two occasions in the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.7%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The company's sustained focus on introducing new products is expected to continue boosting revenues. Moreover, its unique intellectual properties and global support are likely to drive forthcoming results.Also, Synopsys' time-based license revenue model under which customers effectively rent the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee is impressive. Notably, this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream.Additionally, acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies as well as diversify and broaden product portfolio. In fact, the company's continued acquisitions are expected to make a good contribution to its revenue stream.In September, Synopsys had completed the acquisition of QuantumWise. This buyout has not only enhanced the company's capabilities but has also gained it QuantumWise's customers. Therefore, we expect the acquisition to boost the company's fourth-quarter revenues.However, a challenging technology spending environment, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies, and competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp., remain near-term headwinds. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Synopsys' has an Earnings ESP of -1.22%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"n recent trading, shares of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $87.57, changing hands for $87.82/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Synopsys Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $83.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $92.00. The standard deviation is $3.408.But the whole reason to look at the  SNPS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SNPS crossing above that average target price of $87.57/share, investors in SNPS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $87.57 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Synopsys Inc:

The company's solutions are in demand due to the rising complexity in product design. Additionally, increasing demand for energy efficient products is a key catalyst.ANSYS' strong simulation portfolio is helping it to rapidly grow total addressable market (TAM). This will drive top-line growth in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, growing recurring revenues base (almost 75%) is significantly positive.During the quarter, the company unveiled ANSYS Discovery Live that supports fluids, structural and thermal simulation applications. The software enables engineers to experiment with design ideas and see instant feedback.Notably, the combination of NVIDIA Corporation's  graphic processing units (GPUs) and ANSYS Discovery Live simulation software makes result calculations a thousand times faster compared with traditional methods.We note that ANSYS simulation tools received certification from Intel Customer Foundry during the quarter.

This will drag profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total perpetual revenues is currently pegged at $54 million, which remains almost flat on a year-over-year basis.We believe that ANSYS is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and  of 0.00%.

" stocks are a  in investing these days. By connecting everyday appliances ranging from light bulbs to refrigerators to alarm clocks to... everything else, IoT promises to make the entire world more interconnected, more efficient, and a whole lot smarter. But which stock is the best one to buy to profit from the Internet of Things revolution?RBC Capital thinks it knows. Now here's what  need to know.One day, the Internet of Things may connect the world -- but is Synopsys stock really the best IoT stock in the world? Image source: Getty Images.This morning, RBC capital announced that it is upgrading  (NASDAQ: SNPS) -- already one of its buy-rated stocks -- to the level of its ""Top Pick."" Assigning Synopsys a $100 price target, RBC predicts that Synopsys stock will return approximately an 18% profit to new investors today. But what is Synopsys anyway?Let me sketch it out one piece at a time. In order to become ""smart,"" appliances must be equipped with semiconductor chips that permit them to talk to one another. Someone must make these chips. But before that can happen, someone must build the machines to build the chips. Before those machines can run, someone must code the software to operate the machines that build the chips that make the appliances smart. is that ""someone"" that codes the software that operates the machines that make the chips that make the Internet of Things possible. Sitting at the top of the IoT supply chain, Synopsys is also RBC's top pick.What is it that makes Synopsys RBC's favorite IoT stock? According to the analyst, semiconductor chip designs and redesigns are becoming increasingly complex, and require more and more advanced electronic design automation (EDA) tools to manufacture and test them. As a key member of the government's Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)  team, and recipient of an IARPA contract to develop superconducting electronics, Synopsys possesses the expertise needed to keep up with developments in EDA.As explained in a write-up on  (requires subscription) this morning, RBC expects the company to translate this expertise into improving profit margins over the next two to three years as the company increases its exposure not just to IoT, but to the manufacturers of semiconductors for use in artificial intelligence and driverless cars as well.So how has that thesis been working out?Pretty well, actually. Despite generally declining gross margin, Synopsys has been cutting costs out of its business, allowing its operating profitability to grow as a result. According to data provided by  , over the past three years, Synopsys has expanded its margin by 3.5 percentage points -- growing from 12.1% in fiscal 2014 to a recent high of 15.6% operating profit margin over the past 12 months.Profits are growing as a result, with annual net income up roughly 27% over the past three years. But where you really see Synopsys' moneymaking strength is on its cash flow statement, which shows that over the past 12 months Synopsys has generated nearly $530 million in positive free cash flow -- 60% ahead of the company's reported $329 million in net income. Further improvements in profit margin should only grow that cash haul over time.What does this mean for investors? Valued on net income alone, Synopsys stock looks extremely expensive at 40 times earnings. Valued on the company's real free cash flow, however, the stock sells for a more reasonable multiple of just 24 times FCF. (The stock looks even cheaper when you back out net cash from its market cap. Synopsys's enterprise value-to-free-cash-flow ratio works out to just a little more than 22.)Are these valuations cheap enough to buy? That all depends on how fast Synopsys can grow going forward, and this is where things get tricky for an investor. According to the consensus of analysts surveyed by S&P Global, Synopsys's profits could grow as slowly as just 9% annually over the next five years. More optimistic analysts believe Synopsys can roughly double its earnings between 2016 and 2020, which works out to a growth rate of 18% annually -- but even this faster growth rate would fall just short of justifying a 22-times-free-cash-flow valuation for Synopsys stock.Long story short? RBC capital spins a good story about Synopsys stock, but with Synopsys shares up 44% already over the last 12 months, I fear a lot of the value has already been baked into this share price. My synopsis: Although the prospects look bright for Synopsys' business, the stock currently looks too expensive to buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Synopsys wasn't one of them!

The integration of QuantumWise with Synopsys' Sentaurus TCAD will aid Synopsys better in managing simulation tasks and analyzing simulation resultsThe acquisition is expected to strengthen its position in the TCAD business. By using QuantumWise's solutions, the company will be able to create a higher-quality initial Process Design Kits (PDKs) for Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO). In short, the acquisition will enhance its technical efficiency along with augmenting product and service portfolio.According to Synopsys, ""The QuantumWise technology is a key component of our DTCO solution as it enables the systematic evaluation of new materials by providing TCAD models in the very early stages of technology research before wafers are available."" Consequently, the acquisition will help Synopsys to reduce the costly and time-consuming test wafer runs when evolving a new semiconductor device or technology.Furthermore, through the acquisition, Synopsys will gain QuantumWise's customers thereby boosting the top line.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the  to which it belongs to. Synopsys has returned 36.7%, while the industry gained 25.5%.Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and give it access to newer markets and technologies. Some of its notable buyouts include Cigital, Codiscope, Codenomicon, Coverity and Target Compiler Technologies.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the side-lines.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering are Applied Materials, Inc.  and NVIDIA Corporation  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2018 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new June 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $77.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $84.16/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $84.16/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.82% if the stock gets called away at the June 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.

ontinuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value,  last week announced that it is set to buy back $100 million worth of its common stocks under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. The initiative reflects the California-based company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.Last Thursday, the company announced an agreement with HSBC in this connection. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.01 million shares, while the remaining shares will be received on or before Nov 20, 2017, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys' volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.Per the company, accelerated share repurchase arrangements are an integral element of its overall framework for enhancing investors' worth. Since fiscal 2015, the company has completed $605 million worth of ASR program.Apart from the ASR agreements, the company also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In June 2017, Synopsys approved an extension of its existing share repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. So far in fiscal 2017, the company has repurchased $300 million worth of its common stock.Synopsys' financial strength enables it to continue with its buyback program. As of Jul 31, 2017, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.3 billion. Its aggressive share repurchase policies are anticipated to boost investors' confidence. Synopsys' strategy to return wealth to shareholders highlights its growth potential and stable liquidity position.Notably, in the year-to-date period, the stock has outperformed the  to which it belongs to. Synopsys has returned 35.6% during the said time period, while the industry gained 25.5%.Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc.  , Electronic Arts Inc.  and Accenture plc  .We believe that apart from enhancing shareholders' return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through share repurchases and dividend payouts, companies boost investors' confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Synopsys remains confident of its growth potential, thereby raising hopes for a further hike in shareholder value through dividend payouts and share buybacks.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

hare price of  rallied to a new 52-week high of $132.07, eventually closing a bit lower at $132.01 on Sep 12. The outperformance can be attributed to the company's expanding product portfolio and consistent execution, which are driving top-line growth and profitability.We note that ANSYS has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.02%.Last quarter, earnings increased 6.5% year over year to 99 cents on revenues of $264.4 million, up 13% at constant currency.

The company recently unveiled ANSYS Discovery Live that supports fluids, structural and thermal simulation applications.Currently, ANSYS holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Notably, the combination of NVIDIA's  graphic processing units (GPUs) and ANSYS Discovery Live simulation software makes result calculations a thousand times faster compared with traditional methods.Moreover, acquisitions like Computational Engineering International (CEI), SpaceClaim, Reaction Design and Evolutionary Engineering have expanded the company's expertise in processing and analysis of simulation data, 3D modelling, chemistry simulation and cloud-based composite analysis and optimization technology.These have eventually expanded ANSYS's total addressable market (TAM). The company can now address the needs of diverse industries like IoT, next-gen 5G product designs, autonomous vehicle, mobile products as well as high-performance chips for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Moreover, growing demand for energy efficient products is also a key catalyst.Additionally, collaborations with leading vendors like Autodesk  , Synopsys  and NVIDIA are expected to drive demand for the company's products.However, declining perpetual license revenues will hurt top-line growth at least in the near term.

"he technology sector continues to attract investors due to its dynamic nature. It is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.The technology sector has been a prolific performer on a year-to-date basis with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) registering a return of 22.8% year to date. The positive data suggests that the sector will grow further in 2017. According to a recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT), global IT spending for 2017 will rise 2.4%, up from 0.3% in 2016.Per the research firm, the worldwide public cloud services market is anticipated to increase 18% in 2017 to $246.8 billion, up from $209.2 billion in 2016. It also forecasted that the number of connected things will increase 31% to 8.4 billion in 2017 from 6.4 billion in 2016.So, we believe that this is the right time to invest in this space. However, picking the right stocks is always a tough task. To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further, we have opted for one tried and tested technique - picking stocks near their 52-week highs.The 52-week investment strategy loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing and is one of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook. The basic idea is ""buy high and sell higher"" since once a trend is established, it is likely to continue. In other words, stocks that are growing will continue to grow.The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales, robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects. Major developments may also send stocks soaring. On the flipside, stocks that are trading near their 52-week highs carry the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued. But the positives seem to outweigh the drawbacks.Still, to be on the safer side, why not bet on stocks that besides trading near their 52-week highs and have a positive earnings history.

On a non-GAAP basis (excluding all one-time items), earnings came in at 92 cents per share, up from 76 cents posted in third-quarter fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at 69 cents.The robust year-over-year bottom-line performance was mainly driven by strong revenue growth and efficient cost management. The company's third-quarter revenues jumped 13% year over year to $695.4 million and came toward the higher-end of the previously guided range of $685-$700 million (mid-point $692.5 million).Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $690 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products, and strength in IP and hardware products. About 90% of the revenues came from the backlog in the beginning of the quarter and the remaining 10% was contributed by a customer.Despite reporting strong quarterly results, shares of Synopsys were down as much as 3.3% during yesterday's after-hour trade, before settling down at 1.4%. This may be due to the fact that the company's non-GAAP earnings came in toward the lower-end of the previously provided guidance range of 91-94 cents.Nonetheless, Synopsys stock has gained 34.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 22.6% rally of the  it belongs to.Segment wise, License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $603.8 million, up nearly 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Operating margin expanded 220 bps on a year-over-year basis to 24.1%.The company's non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $141.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 21.9%. | Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.302 billion million compared with $1.131 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $411.3 million compared with $373.8 million in the last quarter.During the first three quarters, the company generated $449.7 million of cash flow from operational activities. The company repurchased $300 million worth of its common stock during the first nine months of fiscal 2017. The company has remaining $500 million for its current authorization.Buoyed by better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, Synopsys raised its fiscal 2017 outlook. The company now expects fiscal 2017 revenues to be in the range of $2.670-$2.685 billion (previous guidance $2.650-$2.670 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.67 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $3.29 and $3.32 (previously $3.24 and $3.29).

Additionally, the company's fourth-quarter and upbeat fiscal 2017 guidance are encouraging.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Furthermore, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its near-term performance. Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to its customers.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Couple of better-ranked stocks in the same industry space are Red Hat, Inc.  and Adobe Systems Incorporated  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Red Hat and Adobe Systems have long-term expected EPS growth rates of 14.4% and 16.6%, respectively.Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

"Chicago, IL - September 15, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (Nasdaq:  -  ),  (Nasdaq:  -  ),  (Nasdaq:  -  ),  (Nasdaq:  -  ),  (Nasdaq:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The technology sector continues to attract investors due to its dynamic nature. It is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.The technology sector has been a prolific performer on a year-to-date basis with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) registering a return of 22.8% year to date. The positive data suggests that the sector will grow further in 2017. According to a recent forecast provided by Gartner Inc. (IT), global IT spending for 2017 will rise 2.4%, up from 0.3% in 2016.Per the research firm, the worldwide public cloud services market is anticipated to increase 18% in 2017 to $246.8 billion, up from $209.2 billion in 2016. It also forecasted that the number of connected things will increase 31% to 8.4 billion in 2017 from 6.4 billion in 2016.So, we believe that this is the right time to invest in this space. However, picking the right stocks is always a tough task. To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further, we have opted for one tried and tested technique - picking stocks near their 52-week highs.The 52-week investment strategy loosely borrows from the basics of Momentum investing and is one of the relatively new entries in the investing rulebook. The basic idea is ""buy high and sell higher"" since once a trend is established, it is likely to continue. In other words, stocks that are growing will continue to grow.The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales, robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects. Major developments may also send stocks soaring. On the flipside, stocks that are trading near their 52-week highs carry the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued. But the positives seem to outweigh the drawbacks.Still, to be on the safer side, why not bet on stocks that besides trading near their 52-week highs and have a positive earnings history. The stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a  of A or B. Notably, back-tested results show that this favorable combination handily outperforms other stocks.

 .  is set to release second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 2. Notably, the company has positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 3.94%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.94%.

Net revenue is anticipated in the range of $254-$263 million.ANSYS's stock has gained 38.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 22.3% rally of the  it belongs to. The outperformance can be attributed to the improving bottom line and positive guidance.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.ANSYS expects the transition from perpetual license contracts to longer term, time-based licenses at some of the company's largest customers (in mature markets like the U.S. and Japan) to impact software license and maintenance revenues growth in the near term. Moreover, weakness in Europe and adverse foreign currency exchange rates are other major concerns. | Nevertheless, we note that ANSYS is a dominant player in the high-end design simulation software market. The company has significant growth opportunity from the rising complexity in product design owing to rapid adoption of IoT in the manufacturing industry. Moreover, growing demand for energy efficient products is also a key catalyst.Further, collaboration with the likes of Synopsys  and PTC are enabling ANSYS to expand customer base. This is anticipated to boost top-line growth in the going-to-be reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that ANSYS is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. : Currently, Earnings ESP is +1.19%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is currently pegged at 85 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : ANSYS carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kemet Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .Vishay Intertechnology  has an Earnings ESP of +6.06% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

nvestors considering a purchase of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $76.49/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $70 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.35. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.9% return against the $70 commitment, or a 5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to SNPS's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $70 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Synopsys Inc sees its shares fall 8.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $68.65 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.35 from $70), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $70 strike for the 5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Synopsys Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $76.49) to be 16%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Friday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 829,531 contracts, with call volume at 829,531, for a put:call ratio of 0.73 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Agree To Purchase Synopsys At $70, Earn 5% Annualized Using Options@2017-07-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agree-purchase-synopsys-70-earn-5-annualized-using-options-2017-07-28

The decision reflects the company's trend of returning wealth to its shareholders from time to time, depending on market conditions.Trac Pham, chief financial officer of Synopsys, stated, ""We are pleased to be in a position to extend our share repurchase program with this new authorization and will continue to balance return of capital to stockholders, debt reduction and strategic investments to grow the business.""Synopsys' financial strength allows it to continue with its buyback program. The company exited the last reported quarter (second-quarter fiscal 2017) with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.131 billion million compared with $966.3 million at the end of the previous quarter. During the same quarter, cash flow from operational activities was $123 million. The company repurchased $100 million of its common stock during the quarter.

You can see .Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc.  , Electronic Arts Inc.  and Accenture plc  .We believe that apart from enhancing shareholders' return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through dividend payouts, companies bolster investors' confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Synopsys remains confident of its growth potential, thereby raising hopes for a further increase in shareholder value through dividend payouts and share buybacks.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"n 2012, graphics specialist  (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF) acquired processor intellectual property maker MIPS Technologies for $100 million in a bid to diversify its product portfolio beyond graphics technology.MIPS processors are used in a variety of applications, but in recent years, chip vendors that had previously used MIPS technology (for example, network chip vendors) have begun transitioning their product lines over to processor designs and/or intellectual property developed by ARM Holdings.Image source: Intel.Imagination had hoped to push the MIPS architecture as a viable alternative to the ARM architecture in the multibillion-unit smartphone applications processor market, but ultimately found little success in doing so. Imagination eventually  its ambitions vis-a-vis MIPS.After Imagination disclosed last month that  (NASDAQ: AAPL) , a customer that accounts for roughly half of its revenues, would no longer use its PowerVR graphics technology, Imagination announced that it plans to sell its MIPS and Ensigma businesses to ""concentrate its resources on PowerVR, and strengthen Imagination's balance sheet.""Now that MIPS is for sale, the question is, who's going to buy it?Investors may recall that Imagination wasn't the only company interested in buying the MIPS assets in 2012. Fellow semiconductor intellectual property vendor,  (NASDAQ: CEVA) , originally agreed to  the MIPS assets for $90 million, but Imagination outbid CEVA, offering $100 million.Given CEVA's prior interest in the MIPS assets, and given that CEVA's business seems to be going quite well these days, CEVA might be well positioned to take advantage of Imagination's current predicament and score a good deal on the MIPS assets.Another potential buyer could be electronic design automation (EDA) tool and fellow semiconductor intellectual property vendor,  (NASDAQ: SNPS) . Synopsys was  as a potential acquirer of the MIPS assets way back in 2012 by analyst Gary Mobley.Synopsys currently offers a type of RISC processor family known as ARC (""Argonaut RISC Core""), which the company says target applications such as automotive and industrial, Internet of Things, mobile, storage, and digital home. The MIPS assets could allow Synopsys to further expand its processor intellectual property portfolio and possibly even supplant the ARC-based technology.I have seen other potential buyers mentioned that I don't think are all that likely. I went over why I don't think  (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a name that has come up -- would buy the MIPS assets and switch to MIPS from ARM  .Another chipmaker comes up as a potential buyer of the MIPS assets:  (NASDAQ: INTC) . However, that doesn't make sense for several reasons.In Intel's personal computer and server processor markets (the bulk of Intel's revenue), as well as in its Internet of Things business, the company's X86 architecture has been and will likely continue to be highly successful.Intel has also made it clear that it would like to be a contract manufacturer of ARM-based applications processors and quite vocally signaled that it would be working with ARM Holdings to allow chipmakers to easily implement ARM's processor technology in Intel's chip manufacturing technology.Considering that MIPS processors haven't been successful in the mobile applications processor market (the market that Intel wants ARM's help to compete in), I don't see MIPS bringing much value to Intel's technology portfolio.

"hares of  scaled a new 52-week high of $78.97 during yesterday's trading session, before closing a tad lower at $78.23. This comes a day before its third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release which is scheduled to be announced after the market close.Notably, the stock has added 32.9% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the  's gain of 21.7%.The recent momentum in share price reflects investor confidence that the company may once again report splendid results for the third quarter. We note that the stock has an excellent track record of exceeding the quarterly earnings expectations. With respect to the earnings surprise history, Synopsys has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 21.9%.Apart from this, the company's impressive third-quarter outlook and upbeat fiscal 2017 guidance have also aided the year-to-date upward movement in share price. For the third quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $685-$700 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 91-94 cents.For fiscal 2017, Synopsys raised its revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range to $2.650-$2.670 billion and $3.24-$3.29, respectively, from $2.58-$2.61 billion and $3.21-$3.26.We believe that the company's sustained focus on introducing new products, acquisitions and deal wins will continue to boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company are likely to drive forthcoming results.We are also positive about Synopsys' time-based license revenue model, under which, customers effectively rent the software, rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee. Hence this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream.Additionally, the acquisition of Cigital and Codiscope will enable Synopsys to offer a comprehensive software security signoff solution to its customers.We are also encouraged by Synopsys's endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also inspire investor confidence and loyalty. | Currently, Synopsys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Lam Research Corp.  , IPG Photonics Corp.  and Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc.  . All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see In the trailing four quarters, Lam Research, IPG Photonics and Ultra Clean Holdings delivered average positive earnings surprises of 4.44%, 9.15% and 27.73%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options become available this week, for the December 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $67.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $73.58/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 66%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.50% return on the cash commitment, or 5.46% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.90. If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $73.58/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.23% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.30% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.27% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 20%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 21%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $73.58) to be 17%.

"n recent trading, shares of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $66.57, changing hands for $70.66/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Synopsys Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $58.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $75.00. The standard deviation is $5.411.But the whole reason to look at the  SNPS price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with SNPS crossing above that average target price of $66.57/share, investors in SNPS have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $66.57 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

ontinuing with its efforts to enhance shareholder value,  last week entered into a fresh accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with Wells Fargo Bank NA, just within a week of completing its earlier deal entered on Dec 6, 2016 with the same financial institution. This reflects the California-based company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.The new ASR agreement is also of the same value, i.e. $100 million. Per the agreement, Synopsys will initially receive approximately 1.12 million shares while the remaining shares will be received on or before May 17, 2017, depending on the completion of purchase. The number of shares to be repurchased will be calculated on the basis of Synopsys' volume weighted average share price during the stated period, after adjusting for a discount.The company's newly announced ASR agreement boosts investors' confidence in the stock, driving shares up 1.2% last Friday. Moreover, in the last one year, the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry. Synopsys has returned 61% during the said time frame while the industry gained 27.4%.According to the company, accelerated share repurchase arrangements are an integral element of its overall framework for enhancing investors' worth. Earlier, apart from the Dec 6, 2016 agreement, the company had initiated an ASR program worth $125 million in May last year. In Dec 2015, it initiated a $200 million ASR program while in Dec 2014, it started a $180 million ASR program that was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.Apart from the ASR agreement, the company also repurchased its common stock from the open market. In Sep 2016, Synopsys approved an extension of its existing share repurchase authorization to make it worth $500 million again. The company repurchased stock worth $400 million in fiscal 2016.Moreover, continuing with its strategy of returning cash to shareholders, the company bought $100 million of its common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of Jan 31, 2017, Synopsys had nearly $335 million remaining under its normal share repurchase program at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2017.Synopsys' financial strength allows it to continue with its buyback program. As of Jan 31, 2017, the company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $966.3 million. The company's aggressive share repurchase policies are expected to boost investors' confidence. Synopsys' strategy to return wealth to shareholders reflects its growth potential and stable liquidity position.Other companies that have a consistent record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments are Apple Inc.  , Electronic Arts Inc.  and Accenture plc  .We believe that apart from enhancing shareholders' return, these initiatives also raise the market value of the stock. Through dividend payouts, companies bolster investors' confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip.

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options begin trading this week, for the September 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new September 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $62.67/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 78%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.27% return on the cash commitment, or 3.56% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.85. If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $62.67/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.27% if the stock gets called away at the September 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

However, the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.Forcheck offers static code analysis tools in Fortran applications that meet the industry coding standards and compliances.

Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.25% if the stock gets called away at the January 2017 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.82% boost of extra return to the investor, or 4.98% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 21%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.07) to be 19%.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Nov 30. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 41.86%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 25.14%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys posted better-than-expected third quarter of fiscal 2016 results. Also, third quarter revenues saw a year-over-year improvement, mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and strength in hardware products.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity is expected to expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.The company announced the expansion of its existing share repurchase program, which has increased the authorization to $500 million. The step reflects the California-based company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp., a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 46 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .

"Chicago, IL - October 21, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. It seems that worldwide IT spending is likely to witness second consecutive year of decline, as predicted by Gartner Inc. (NYSE:  -  ). The firm forecasts that global IT spending will fall slightly this year compared to IT spending levels in 2015.The information technology research and advisory firm revealed its predictions in its week long Gartner Symposium/ITxpo event, where Gartner analysts discussed the IT and business issues that contributed to the evolution of the digital business.Gartner estimates IT spending to decline 0.3% year over year to $3.39 trillion from $3.41 trillion in 2015. This is the third time this year that the firm has lowered its global IT spending forecast for 2016. Gartner had earlier forecast spending of $3.54 trillion and $3.41 trillion in the last two reports, on Jan 18 and Jul 7, respectively.The research firm cited the United Kingdom's vote to exit from the European Union (EU) as the main reason behind the recent forecast cut. John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner said ""The immediate impact of Brexit has caused modest growth in IT spending to turn negative for 2016"". He further added ""The immediate impact of the British pound will also cause the IT spending patterns to shift as prices for IT will increase.""According to the firm, IT spending will increase 0.2% excluding the U.K. Per Gartner, as Britain has voted in favor of the exit from EU, companies will have to change their IT investment plans accordingly, which will negatively impact overall IT spending.As per Gartner, ""Companies will be monitoring negotiations closely, and there will be some changes in IT investment. For example, in financial services, analysts expect to see some countries in Europe put more investment in IT to offer a more viable option for EU countries than the U.K.""The tech companies will certainly not be happy with the recent outlook cut, but Gartner's global IT spending outlook for 2017 will certainly please them. The research firm projects spending to reach $3.49 trillion next year, representing an increase of 2.9% from $3.39 trillion in 2016. Notably, 2017 spending will also be higher than the 2015 level of $3.41 trillion.The robust growth is anticipated to be mainly driven by an increase in Software and IT Services spending. Gartner predicts Software spending to increase 6% year over year to $333 billion in 2016 and to grow another 7.2% in 2017 to reach $357 billion.Similarly, IT Services spending will witness year-over-year growth of 3.9% in 2016 to reach $900 billion. On top of that, the industry will see a 4.8% rise in 2017 spending to total $943 billion.Software and IT Services segments in Germany and France have witnessed an increase in spending, while in the U.K. it remains the same, as per Gartner. The Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland are also increasing their IT spending ""to contend as a viable alternative to banks in the U.K."", Lovelock said. He further added, ""We are seeing examples of many banks in talks with these countries to examine the possibility of moving their operations outside of the U.K.""In the U.S., the firm does not see any impact on IT spending due to the pending presidential elections that will take place on Nov 8. It also sees no effect on IT spending trends irrespective of who wins.Additionally, other remaining segments, i.e. Data Center Systems, Devices and Communications Services will witness year-over-year growth of 2%, 0.4% and 1.9%, respectively in 2017. However, spending across Devices and Communications Services segments will decline 7.5% and 1.1%, respectively, in 2016, while Data Center Systems segment's spending will increase 1.3%.Over the last one and a half years, worldwide IT spending has been hit hard by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. Apart from this, many organizations may have tightened their belts due to macroeconomic uncertainty in various geographies and sluggish growth in China and other emerging economies, in our opinion.Although, overall spending will remain below the 2014 level of $3.8 trillion, looking at forecasts provided by Gartner, we believe that 2017 will mark a recovery in worldwide IT spending led by Software and IT Services segments.So, it will be prudent to shift your focus to Software and IT Services stocks that still hold promise.

n Oct 18, 2016, Zacks  upgraded  to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). With a robust return of 23.7% over the past one year and an encouraging revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016, Synopsys is an attractive investment opportunity.Synopsys recently announced expansion of its existing share repurchase program, which has increased the authorization to $500 million. The step reflects the California-based company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.Synopsys' board of directors first approved the stock repurchase program way back in 2002. The company's financial strength, validated by its strong cash position and liquidity, allows it to continue with its buyback program.As of Jul 31, 2016, Synopsys' cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.089 billion, while short-term debt was only $277.5 million.In May, the company announced that it will buy back $125 million worth of its common stock under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. We note that the company had nearly $175 million remaining under its normal share repurchase program at the end of the third quarter of 2016.Meanwhile, the company reported impressive third-quarter results. Revenues saw a year-over-year improvement, mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and strength in hardware products. Additionally, the company provided encouraging fourth quarter guidance and raised its fiscal 2016 outlook.For fiscal 2016, the company now expects revenues in a range of $2.410-$2.425 billion (previously $2.360-$2.400 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.417 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $3.00 and $3.03 (previously $2.95 and $3.00). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.72 per share. The company projects cash from operations in the range of $525 million to $545 million (previously $510 million to $530 million).For fourth quarter fiscal 2016, the company expects revenues in the range of $621 million-$636 million (mid-point $628.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $628 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 75 cents-78 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.With respect to earnings surprise, Synopsys has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 25.1%.Moreover, the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective. This is because Synopsys currently trades at a forward P/E of 34.81x as against the industry group average of 57.80x, which signifies a huge upward potential.Furthermore, we believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  , a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines. | A stock worth considering in the technology sector is Amazon.com, Inc.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2016-11-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ishares-core-sp-mid-cap-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2016-11-21
hares of  have been gaining solid momentum of late. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company's better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2016, along with an upbeat guidance for the full fiscal year.Since its last quarterly earnings release on Aug 17, the stock has gained nearly 7% and touched a new 52-week high of $59.80 on Friday. Year to date, the stock has gained nearly 31%. | In the third quarter, the company's adjusted earnings as well as revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and witnessed year-over-year growth, backed mainly by higher adoption of Synopsys' products and strength in hardware products.Buoyed by a strong third-quarter performance, Synopsys provided an encouraging fourth-quarter guidance and raised its fiscal 2016 expectations.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 25.1%.Furthermore, the company has recently increased its share repurchase authorization to $500 million. We believe that an aggressive share buyback policy will boost investor confidence in the stock, thereby driving the stock price upward, going ahead.Synopsys is a provider of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. Synopsys has also made a few important acquisitions to build its product portfolio and drive growth. Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy, and help it gain access to newer markets and technologies. Also, since intense competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, takeovers have helped the company to boost its top line.Furthermore, we believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will propel results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely provide it boost in the upcoming quarter.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  , a challenging technology spending environment, and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.A stock worth considering in the technology sector is NVIDIA Corp.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

 reported better-than-expected results in the second-quarter of fiscal 2017. The top and the bottom line also witnessed impressive year-over-year improvement.The company's adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding all other one-time items) of 61 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. The figure also increased approximately 27% from the year-ago quarter on the back of strong top-line growth and effective cost management.Xilinx reported fiscal second-quarter revenues of approximately $579.3 million, up 9.8% year over year and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $575 million. On a sequential basis, the company's revenues grew roughly 1%.Sales at the Communications & Data Center division increased 9% from the prior-year quarter. However, the same decreased 6% sequentially. Revenues at Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive increased 8% on a year over year and 5% sequentially. Sales at the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense division increased 11% on a year-over-year basis and 7% sequentially.Product-wise, revenues from Advanced products increased a whopping 61% year over year and 10% sequentially, driven mainly by record sales of 28-nm and 20-nm products. In addition, the revamp of 16-nm products started contributing to the top line during the quarter. On the other hand, as expected, revenues from core products declined 14% from the year-ago quarter and 6% sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from North America and Asia-Pacific increased 20% and 6%, respectively, while that from Europe jumped 11%. On the other hand, revenues from Japan declined 7% on a year-over-year basis.Xilinx reported a 50 basis points (bps) contraction in adjusted gross margin on a year-over-year basis to 69.6%. Also, reported gross margin was below the company's guidance of 70% mainly due to the impact of a licensing agreement with Rambus.Adjusted operating expenses increased 4.8% to $225.3 million. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 38.9%, reflecting a 180 bps year-over-year decline.Xilinx's adjusted operating margin expanded 130 bps year over year to 30.7%. In terms of dollars, adjusted operating income increased 14.9% year over year to $178.1 million. Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $165.4 million compared with $129.1 million.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.49 billion, compared with $3.52 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of about $994.4 million.During the quarter, Xilinx generated cash of $183.6 million from operations and incurred $11 million as capital expenditure. Moreover, the company paid $83.9 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $99.9 million during the quarter.Concurrent with fiscal second-quarter results, Xilinx announced that its board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of 33 cents per share. The raised dividend will be paid on Nov 23, 2016 to shareholders of record as on Nov 8, 2016.The company provided encouraging top-line guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Management expects revenues to be sequentially flat.Gross margin is anticipated to be approximately 69%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $245 million, which includes approximately $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Effective tax rate stands at approximately 14%.The California-based chipmaker reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Also, earnings and revenues improved year over year.Revenues by end markets (Communications & Data Center, Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive and Industrial, Aerospace & Defense) registered year-over-year growth.Increasing demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's new product launches should further aid revenues.Nonetheless, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  remains a material headwind. | Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN) and Synopsys Inc. ( SNPS), both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Amazon and Synopsys have a long-term expected growth rate of 35% and 9%, respectively.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

hares of  hit a new 52-week high of $59.04 on Aug 23, 2016, eventually closing at $58.93. The shares have been particularly buoyant in recent times, jumping 7.9% over the past one month. The closing share price also represents a strong one-year return of 31% and a year-to-date return of 29.2%.The price increase was supported by a significant rise in share volume. Average volume of shares traded over the last 10 days (1.02M) increased substantially from the average volume of shares traded over the last three months (901k).This price appreciation can be attributed to the company's better-than-expected third quarter of fiscal 2016 results announced on Aug 17, 2016. Also, third quarter revenues saw a year-over-year improvement, mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and strength in hardware products. Moreover, the company provided an encouraging fourth quarter guidance and raised its fiscal 2016 guidance.For fiscal 2016, the company now expects revenues in a range of $2.410-$2.425 billion (previously $2.360-$2.400 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.417 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $3.00 and $3.03 (previously $2.95 and $3.00).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $628 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses within $483 million-$493 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 75 cents-78 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.With respect to earnings surprise, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 25.1%.Moreover, the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective. This is because Synopsys currently trades at a forward P/E of 34.02x as against the industry group average of 67.50x, which signifies a huge upward potential.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries.

 recently announced another refilling of its existing share repurchase program, which has again increased the authorization to $500 million. The step reflects the California-based company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.Synopsys' board of directors first approved the stock repurchase program way back in 2002. The company's financial strength, validated by its strong cash position and liquidity, allows it to continue with its buyback program.As of Jul 31, 2016, Synopsys' cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.089 billion, while short-term debt was only $277.5 million.In May, the company announced that it would buy back $125 million worth of its common stock under an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. We note that the company had nearly $175 million remaining under its normal share repurchase program at the end of the third quarter of 2016.Meanwhile, the company reported impressive third-quarter results. Revenues saw a year-over-year improvement, mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and by dint of its strength in hardware products. Additionally, the company provided encouraging fourth quarter guidance and raised its fiscal 2016 outlook.With respect to earnings surprise, Synopsys' has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 25.1%. | Notably, Synopsys shares have surged almost 30% year-to-date, as compared with S&P 500's return of 6.2%, primarily due to the consistent performance. We believe the company's aggressive share buyback policy will further boost investors' confidence, thereby driving up the stock price, going forward.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, intellectual properties and global support to promotion and sales provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks include Avid Technology  , Infoblox  and DST Systems  . While both Avid and Infoblox sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), DST has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

"hares of  hit a new 52-week high of $22.97 on Aug 15, eventually closing at $22.88. The stock has delivered a one-year return of 4.7% and a year-to-date return of 8.9%. The average trading volume for the last three months aggregated approximately 10.67M.An impressive record of beating quarterly earnings expectations, an optimistic second-quarter and fiscal 2017 outlook, solid cash flows and a decent dividend yield are the factors that drove Symantec to a new high.The company's adjusted earnings (excluding amortization, restructuring and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation) of 23 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents.Although Symantec's revenues of $884 million declined 3.1% year over year, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $878 million. Quarterly revenues were above the mid-point of the guided range of $865 million to $895 million (mid-point: $880 million).According to Thomas Seifert, Symantec CFO, ""Our revenue was above the mid-point of our guided range for Q1, driven by improved performance within Enterprise Security and continued in-line results from Consumer Security.""Symantec recently completed the acquisition of Blue Coat, Inc., a leading web security solution provider, from private equity firm Bain Capital. The addition of Blue Coat is expected to enhance Symantec's capabilities significantly. As per Symantec, the acquisition will not only provide economies of scale and bolster its existing portfolio, but will also provide necessary resources to develop solutions to ""protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals.""Moreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Symantec currently trades at a forward P/E of 25.04x as against the industry group average of 45.40x.With respect to earnings surprise, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out the last four quarters with an average surprise of 6.07%.Buoyed by better-than-expected results, the company raised its fiscal 2017 guidance and provided an encouraging second-quarter outlook.The company updated its fiscal 2017 guidance. For fiscal 2017, Symantec now expects revenues of $4.040 billion to $4.120 billion (previously $3.49 billion to $3.58 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.067 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be $1.08 to $1.14 (previously $1.06 to $1.10). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 90 cents.For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Symantec expects revenues in the range of $960 million to $990 million (mid-point: $975 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $970 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 18 cents to 21 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 15 cents.However, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of Intel  and Microsoft  , remain headwinds. The uncertainty over PC sales also adds to its woes.Apart from Symantec, Synopsys Inc.  also hit a 52-week high of $56.29 yesterday. | Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - August 09, 2016 - Stocks in this week's article include:  and A number of factors influence investment decisions, particularly when it comes to picking stocks. While investors with a high-risk appetite looking for higher returns seek sophisticated and complex strategies, conventional investment strategies that are based on key fundamentals are largely deployed by a class of investors having a low-risk appetite.Conventional strategies are not only safe and sound, but they are also worthwhile in bearish markets. We have picked one such strategy that is focused on the sales growth of a company.In the current market scenario with changing customer preferences and habits, evolving needs, demographic changes and an extremely competitive environment, maintaining a steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Companies are always looking out for ways to boost their marketing initiatives to drive sales.Notably, revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business. It's worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company's future earnings performance.Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation. It remains a key stock selection criteria keeping in mind that management usually has limited opportunities to tamper with revenues as they can with earnings. Thus, the P/S ratio is subject to lesser manipulation than the Price-to-Earnings ratio.Sales growth in isolation is, however, not a sufficient criterion for success. A consideration of a company's cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.A careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors to not only build wealth but beat the market as well.In order to shortlist stocks that have impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we added  and  as our primary screening parameters.However, sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. : This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. : Northward estimate revision has often been observed to trigger an increase in the stock price. : Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company. : This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. High ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable. : Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the eight stocks that made it through the screen: (  ) is a leading healthcare diagnostics company, providing clinical laboratory services and drug development support. This Burlington, NC-based company currently has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 10.2% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

" reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 wherein both the top and bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, on a year-over-year basis, both revenues and earnings witnessed a decline.Seagate reported non-GAAP earnings per share (excluding the impact of tax benefits, amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges and other one-time items) of 69 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents. However, non-GAAP earnings were down from 77 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, the company posted earnings of 23 cents per share, up from 43 cents earned in the prior-year period. The year-over-year earnings decline was mainly due to lower revenues.Seagate reported revenues of $2.654 billion, down 9.3% year over year from $2.927 billion. Nevertheless, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.593 billion.Seagate's non-GAAP gross profit fell 13.8% year over year to $685 million, mainly due to a lower revenue base. Moreover, gross margin contracted 140 basis points (bps) to 25.8%.Non-GAAP operating income came in at $242 million, compared with $280 million reported a year ago. Operating margin contracted 50 bps to 9.1% primarily due to lower gross margin, which was partially offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.Seagate posted non-GAAP net income (excluding the impact of tax benefits, amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, gain on arbitration award and other one-time items) of $209 million or 69 cents per share, compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 tally of $250 million or 77 cents.Seagate exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.13 billion, compared with $1.19 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $4.13 billion.During fiscal 2016, Seagate generated $1.680 billion from operating activities. The company paid $727 million as dividends and repurchased shares worth $1.090 billion during the fiscal year.Concurrent with its fourth-quarter earnings release, the company declared a cash dividend of 63 cents per share, payable on Oct 5 to shareholders of record as of Sep 21. | Seagate's results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 were better than our expectations. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues as well as earnings recorded a significant decline.Notably, during the announcement of its  on Jul 12, Seagate had revealed expectations of higher revenues and margins in the quarter on the back of rising demand for the company's HDD products and cost cutting initiatives.Moreover, the company was anticipating unit shipments in the quarter of roughly 37 million, translating to a total average capacity per drive of 1.7 terabytes and average selling price (ASP) of $67.00 per unit.According to Steve Luczo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Seagate, ""We believe the long-term trend of exabyte storage demand growth exceeding HDD areal density growth remains intact for the foreseeable future. Seagate will continue to evolve its product offering, technology investment and manufacturing footprint to best serve our customers with the world's most advanced and cost advantaged HDD products.""In our opinion, Seagate will benefit from the strength in its hybrid drives. Also, the company is focusing on the enterprise side, where it could acquire higher-margin businesses. Synergies from acquisitions and product innovations will continue to drive growth.However, sluggish macroeconomic conditions, a flattish price environment and competition from Western Digital Corp.  remain the near-term headwinds. Furthermore, continued cannibalization of PCs by mobile devices could dent its future performance.Currently, Seagate has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A couple of other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector are Adobe Systems Inc.  and Synopsys Inc.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hares of  have been gaining solid momentum of late. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company's better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, along with an encouraging fiscal third-quarter outlook and a raised guidance for fiscal 2016.Notably, the stock has gained approximately 8% since it reported fiscal second-quarter results on May 18. Also, year to date, the stock has soared nearly 43%.In the fiscal second quarter, the company's earnings per share of 66 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents. In fact, Synopsys has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the past four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 18.84%.Meanwhile, the company's revenues increased 8.6% year over year to $605 million and was within management's guided range of $595-$610 million. Reported revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $599 million. Revenues were driven by higher adoption of Synopsys' products and strength in hardware products.Backed by the strong results, the company issued an encouraging outlook for the fiscal third quarter and raised its fiscal 2016 guidance.Some of the optimism surrounding the stock may also be attributed to its efforts on offering customers increased hardware efficiency and enabling significant reductions in both CPU memory consumption and manufacturing turnaround time.Synopsys sells electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships while focusing on cost efficiencies, and many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Besides, acquisitions have helped Synopsys gain access to newer markets and technologies. Since intensifying competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate into, strategic buyouts boost the company's revenues as evident from last quarter's top-line performance.Recently, the company has acquired Simpleware - a privately owned company that specializes in developing software products that help convert ""3D scan data into high-quality computer models used for engineering design and simulation"". The transaction will not only enhance Synopsys' product portfolio, but also add the former's customers, thereby boosting the top line.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will aid results, going ahead. Apart from this, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will drive results. Additionally, Synopsys' acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools markets.Currently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other stocks worth considering in broader technology sector include DST Systems Inc.  , CommVault Systems Inc.  and Silicon Motion Technology Corp.  , each carrying the same Zacks Rank as Synopsys.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 reported second-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) of 12 cents, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents. Also, reported earnings compared favourably with the year-ago quarter figure of 11 cents. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher revenues.Total revenue for the quarter increased 5.1% year over year to $76.5 million. The increase was mainly due to better-than-expected patent revenues from security technology development projects (including revenue from the SCS acquisition).Reported revenues were toward the higher end of management's guided range of $72 million and $77 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $75 million.Total operating costs and expenses of $64.5 million were 12.6% higher than the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher consulting costs and higher headcount related costs owing to the Smart Card Software acquisition.Excluding one-time items but including stock based compensation expenses, total operating costs and expenses increased nearly 9.1% year over year to $55.6 million. As a percentage of revenues, it increased 267 basis points to 72.6%.This, in turn, negatively impacted operating results. Adjusted operating income (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) came in at $20.9 million compared with $21.9 million in the year-ago quarter, decreasing 4.2% year over year. Adjusted operating margin was 27.4% compared with 30.1% a year ago.On a GAAP basis, net income was approximately $3.9 million, which decreased from $6.9 million reported last year. Also, net income on an adjusted basis (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) was approximately $14.5 million compared with $14.8 million.Rambus exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of roughly $259.3 million, up from $225.6 million in the previous quarter.For the third quarter, the company expects revenues between $75 million and $80 million, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82 million. Total operating expense is expected to be in the range of $50 million and $53 million. Operating income for the third quarter is expected to be between $22 million and $30 million.Full year revenues are projected to be $313 million (+/- 5 million), lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $321 million. | Rambus reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Moreover, the quarterly revenues and earnings increased from the year-ago period as well. However, the company provided a tepid third-quarter and full year 2016 revenue guidance.Nonetheless, Rambus is poised well to capitalize on the rising popularity of energy-efficient lighting, and LED products in the latest architectural, retail, commercial and residential lighting fixtures. The recent acquisition of Smart Card Software will enhance its product offerings, thereby boosting its top and bottom line performance over the long run, in our view.Rambus is going through a restructuring phase and we expect it to yield favourable results. Additionally, licensing agreements - the result of successful monetization of Rambus' patents - remains a recurring revenue source.However, competition from Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.  and Advanced Micro Devices  and customer concentration remain headwinds for the company.Currently, Rambus has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Synopsys Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hares of  hit a new 52-week high of $53.46 on Jun 8, eventually closing at $53.44. The shares have been particularly buoyant in recent times, jumping 11.4% over the past one month. The closing share price also represents a decent one-year return of 6.4% and a year-to-date return of 17.2%.The price increase was supported by a significant rise in share volume. Average volume of shares traded over the last 10 days (799K) increased substantially from the 775k average volume of shares traded over the last three months.This price appreciation can be attributed to the recently announced buyout of Gold Standard Simulations Ltd.  . The acquisition is in line with Synopsys' continued investments toward enhancing its electronic design automation (EDA) software product portfolio. Synopsys sells EDA software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships while focusing on cost efficiencies, which have led many to select Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Also, the company has acquired Simpleware - a privately owned company that specializes in developing software products that help convert ""3D scan data into high-quality computer models used for engineering design and simulation"". The transaction will not only enhance Synopsys' product portfolio, but also expand its customer base, thereby boosting the top line.It is also worth noting that Synopsys' share price has been increasing continuously since the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 18. Also, second quarter revenues saw a year-over-year improvement, mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and strength in hardware products. Moreover, the company provided an encouraging third quarter guidance and raised its fiscal 2016 guidance.For fiscal 2016, the company now expects revenues in a range of $2.360-$2.400 billion (previously $2.350-$2.390 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.386 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $2.95 and $3.00 (previously $2.93 and $3.00). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.72 per share. The company projects cash from operations in the range of $510 million to $530 million (previously $500 million).For third-quarter fiscal 2016, the company expects revenues in the range of $595-$610 million (mid-point $602.5 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $603 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 72-75 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents.With respect to earnings surprise, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 18.8%.Moreover, the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective. This is because Synopsys currently trades at a forward P/E of 30.67x as against the industry group average of 104.90x, which signifies a huge upward potential.We are positive that the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going forward. Moreover, the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys will likely drive forthcoming results. The company has a good cash reserve that is necessary for funding further acquisitions. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  , a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of  have been gaining solid momentum of late. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company's better-than-expected results for first-quarter 2016, along with an encouraging guidance for the full year.Notably, the stock has gained approximately 14% since it reported first-quarter results on May 9.Though the company posted an adjusted loss in the quarter (excluding amortization, impairment and other one-time items but including stock-based compensation), the figure was narrower than the year-ago quarter level.Moreover, the company's revenues managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate despite witnessing a year-over-year decline. Notably, quarterly results were hurt by difficult market conditions and a lower-than-expected performance at the MakerBot business.Nonetheless, the company's sustained efforts on turning around the MakerBot business were impressive. After announcing restructuring plans in Apr 2015, which included 20% job cuts, MakerBot is now trying to accelerate the adoption of 3D technology by raising awareness. In this regard, in July, the company decided to make the MakerBot Replicator Mini Compact 3D Printer available in all of the 600+ Sam's Club stores across the country.Earlier, they had been available in a few select Sam's Club stores only. These initiatives reflect MakerBot's strategy to increase the accessibility of desktop 3D printing for retail shoppers, which in turn, can accelerate its adoption. We believe that these initiatives will drive the company's performance over the long run.Furthermore, the company's focus on the 3D printing market presents favorable long-term opportunities. Data from the Wohlers Report 2014 revealed that the worldwide 3D printing industry is expected to grow from $3.07 billion in 2013 revenues to $12.8 billion by 2018 and exceed $21 billion in worldwide revenues by 2020, with a CAGR of 34%. Moreover, pent-up demand for 3D printing products is expected from the automotive consumer products, government and defense, industrial/business machines, education research, and others (arts and architecture) segments.Additionally, TechNavio expects the global 3D Printer market to grow at a CAGR of 45% during the 2014-2019 period. Being the 3D printing industry leader, these trends bode well for Stratasys and indicate strong growth prospects, going ahead.However, some customers are delaying their purchases owing to the current economic conditions. In the 3D printer business, majority of customers have moved toward the lower priced uPrint, which may affect the company's margins in the upcoming quarters. Going forward, competition from 3D Systems Corporation  is a potent headwind as well.Currently, Stratasys carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are DST Systems Inc.  and Synopsys Inc.  , both of which sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Aug 17. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 37.50%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 18.84%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe that the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost third-quarter results.Moreover, the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys will likely drive the upcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions, such as those of Gold Standard Simulations, Simpleware and Coverity, have expanded its capabilities and customer base, which are expected to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, intense competition, a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty on the proper time to realize acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 43 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Although Synopsys' Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  , with an Earnings ESP of +25.58% and a Zacks Rank #3.Analog Devices Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.The J. M. Smucker Company  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.87% and a Zacks Rank #3Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Image credit: Intel.The main point here is that taller and thinner fins allow for better transistor performance -- allowing for more performance at a given level of power consumption or lower power consumption at a fixed level of performance.Intel disclosed in late 2014 that in its 14-nanometer process, the ""fins"" are 8nm wide and 42nm tall.In a presentation from electronic design automation tool and IP vendor  (NASDAQ: SNPS) earlier this year, the company showed a very interesting slide:Image credit: Synopsys.According to Synopsys, 14/16-nanometer processes used a fin width of 9-nanometer and fin height of 42-nanometer. I doubt that Synopsys is referring to  Intel here (since Intel doesn't even have a ""16-nanometer"" process), so it stands to reason that Intel wasn't the only company with a 42-nanometer fin height at the 14/16-nanometer generation.What's more interesting is that Synopsys says that at the 10-nanometer node, chip manufacturers will move to fin heights of  50 nanometers and widths of 8 nanometers. And, at 7-nanometers, fin height goes above 50 nanometers.At this point, I think it's worth taking Krzanich's claim about Intel's 14-nanometer technology offering superior performance to ""other technologies that'll be introduced over the next several years"" with a healthy dose of skepticism.Assuming that Intel dedicates a whole presentation to discussing transistor technology later this year at its investor meeting, there's actually a really easy way for the company to ""prove"" its claim: show some data.In particular, Intel could show performance data for its 14-nanometer transistors and compare it to measured transistor performance from competing 14/16-nanometer technologies. Given that TSMC has publicly discussed the kinds of performance improvements it expects from its 10-nanometer technology (up to 18% higher speeds or 40% less power consumption, per  ), it shouldn't be hard for Intel to give its own internal projections of TSMC's 10-nanometer performance (and even 7-nanometer performance) relative to its 14-nanometer technology.

 reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Both the top and the bottom line also witnessed a significant year-over-year improvement.The company reported adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding amortization and other one-time items) from continuing operations of $3.27 per share, which fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.03. Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, adjusted earnings surged 24.3%.On a GAAP basis, earnings from continuing operations came in at $3.26 per share, compared with the year-ago earnings of $2.33.The bottom line was mainly driven by higher revenues, efficient cost management and a lower share count.Tax-preparation related software maker reported revenues of $2.304 billion, which came above management's guided range of $2.210-$2.260 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.246 billion as well. On a year-over-year basis too, revenues were up 7.9% mainly on the back of the company's ongoing transformation into a global cloud company and higher demand resulting from the U.S. tax season.Services and Other revenues climbed nearly 9% to $1.845 billion while product revenues were up 3.8% to $459 million.Segment-wise, Small Business Group recorded 12% year-over-year growth driven mainly by strong customer acquisition, along with continuous subscriber growth for QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed. The company recorded the addition of 140,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers during the quarter, bringing the total global count to 1.397 million.Revenues from Consumer Tax grew 7% year over year. On the other hand, ProTax revenues were roughly flat at $126 million.Coming to operational metrics, Intuit reported adjusted gross profit of $2.093 billion, up 7.8% year over year, mainly backed by higher revenues. However, gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 90.8%.The company reported a 2.6% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating expenses. However, as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating expenses contracted 180 bps to 34.7% primarily due to efficient cost management.The company posted adjusted operating profit of $1.294 billion, up 11.4%. Adjusted operating margin expanded 180 bps to 56.2%.Intuit posted adjusted net income from continuing operations of $851.2 million or $3.27 per share, compared with the third-quarter fiscal 2015 level of $742.9 million or $2.63 per share.Intuit exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and investments of $1.613 billion. Long-term debt was $500 million at the quarter end.Further, Intuit generated $1.711 billion of cash from operational activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2016. During the same time frame, the company also repurchased shares worth $2.190 billion and paid $238 million as dividend.Bolstered by the solid performance, Intuit raised its fiscal 2016 guidance and issued an encouraging outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter.The company now anticipates revenues of $4.660 billion to $4.680 billion, up from its earlier guidance of $4.525-$4.600 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.602 billion.Non-GAAP operating income is now expected in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.510 billion, up from the previous projection of $1.450-$1.480 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $3.63 and $3.65, up from prior guidance of $3.45-$3.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $2.79.Additionally, during the fiscal first quarter, the company had projected capital expenditure of $490-$510 million. Nothing was mentioned in this regard during this quarter.For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $720 million to $740 million, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $718 million.It expects non-GAAP operating loss of $15 million to non-GAAP operating income of $15 million.While the company expects to report breakeven non-GAAP results in the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 22 cents.Intuit reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results that also recorded a year-over-year improvement. Driven by the solid performance, the company also issued an encouraging guidance for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.Moreover, we are positive about Intuit's growing SMB exposure and believe that its strategic acquisitions will boost the segment. Increased adoption of its cloud-based services and products is another positive.Intuit has also restructured its business to focus on the QuickBooks services. It expects to continue investing in this portfolio, which is likely to hurt its near-term profitability.Moreover, rising competition from payroll solution providers such as Paycom Software Inc.  and Automatic Data Processing  is a concern, especially considering the seasonality of Intuit's tax business and the ongoing economic uncertainty.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock worth considering in the technology sector is Synopsys Inc.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It further states that ""Gold Standard's state-of-the-science accurate and predictive simulation and verification tools, that are based upon the breakthrough development and application of physical model methodologies, provide the shortest time-to-development, time-to-design and ultimately time-to-innovation"".The recent acquisition is in line with Synopsys' continued investments toward enhancing its electronic design automation (EDA) software product portfolio. Synopsys sells EDA software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships while focusing on cost efficiencies, which have led many to select Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and give it access to newer markets and technologies. Some of its notable buyouts include Codenomicon, Coverity and Target Compiler Technologies.Also, with intensifying competition making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, acquisitions have gone a long way in helping Synopsys accelerate top-line growth.

ooking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider  , a firm in the Computer - Software industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, SNPS has beaten estimates by at least 30% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Two quarters ago, SNPS expected to earn 30 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 39 cents per share, a beat of 30%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 48 cents/share, when it actually saw earnings of 66 cents/share instead, representing a 37.5% positive surprise.Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Synopsys. In fact, the  for SNPS is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for SNPS, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 4.44%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that SNPS has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. And when you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP,  of the time, so it seems pretty likely that SNPS could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA ETF (Symbol: LRGF), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $26.71 per unit.With LRGF trading at a recent price near $23.59 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.18% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of LRGF's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), AMERCO (Symbol: UHAL), and Everest Re Group Ltd (Symbol: RE). Although SNPS has traded at a recent price of $48.74/share, the average analyst target is 15.31% higher at $56.20/share. Similarly, UHAL has 15.29% upside from the recent share price of $362.99 if the average analyst target price of $418.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting RE to reach a target price of $204.50/share, which is 13.68% above the recent price of $179.89. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SNPS, UHAL, and RE:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Expect 13% Upside For LRGF@2016-05-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-expect-13-upside-lrgf-2016-05-20
e expect  to beat expectations when it reports fiscal second-quarter 2016 results on May 18.Our proven model shows that Synopsys is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Expected Surprise Prediction or  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (50 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (47 cents), stands at +6.38%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Note that stocks with Zacks Rank of #1, 2 and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Synopsys' Zacks Rank #2 and +6.38% ESP makes us very confident in looking for a positive earnings beat.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.Moreover, it is noteworthy that Synopsys has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 118%.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:TiVo Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +25.00% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Agilent Technologies, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.56% and a Zacks Rank #2Intuit Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 .  is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 12. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.22%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Symantec's third-quarter results were better-than-expected. However, year-over-year comparisons were unfavorable for both earnings and revenues. Revenues declined mainly due to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.Symantec's core Norton Anti-virus software business was hit hard by the persistent weakness in PC sales. Other than intensifying competition, this business has been dealt a severe blow by the increased usage of smartphones and tablets. This factor could be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter's results as well.Further, continued investments to launch new and innovative products could impact margins in the near term. Moreover, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These, along with competition from the likes of Intel and Microsoft, remain headwinds.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company's efforts on streamlining operations and maximizing shareholder value. During the fourth quarter, the company closed the sale of its Veritas business for $7.4 billion to Carlyle Group  . We believe that the deal will provide Symantec with much needed funds to continue expanding its product portfolio and presence in the fast-growing markets.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 17 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 19 cents. This translates to an Earnings ESP of -4.00% for Symantec. Symantec's Zacks Rank #2, when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies that are worth considering as our model shows that they have the right combination of the two key elements:Synopsys Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +6.38% and a Zacks Rank #2.Asure Software, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +200.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It is worth noting that CA has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.3%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CA reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. The year-over-year revenue comparison was however unfavorable. CA's major revenue generating segments were adversely affected during the quarter, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange impact.Furthermore, we believe that the increased efficiency offered by the wide range of products will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to the business model.

" is slated to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 12, 2016, after the closing bell.In the preceding quarter, the company disappointed investors by posting a negative earnings surprise of around 75.0%, marking its second consecutive negative surprise. The company has a dismal surprise history, missing estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, missing by an average of 22.33% per quarter.Despite its unimpressive track record, we believe Voxeljet is poised to beat estimates this time around by narrowing down on losses.Our proven model shows that Voxeljet is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. : The  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +18.2%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. : Voxeljet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Meanwhile, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Voxeljet's Zacks Rank #3 and ESP of +18.2% makes us confident of a beat in the upcoming report.Voxeljet's first-quarter financial performance is expected to benefit from rising Services revenues at its German facility and stellar performance of subsidiaries in the U.S. and the U.K. Continuous capacity expansion at the German subsidiary has significantly benefited both volume and the number of shipped parts, thereby driving growth over the past couple of quarters. The company believes strategic repositioning of Voxeljet UK subsidiary and scaling up of operations at Voxeljet America subsidiary will result in stronger performance.Moreover, notable customer demand and positive ""quoting activity"" across the globe are expected to act as fundamental growth drivers for the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company's Systems business is expected to aid quarterly top-line growth as it brings in recurring revenues through the sale of consumables, spare parts and maintenance. Apart from external growth drivers, Voxeljet's internal restructuring actions, which the company has been diligently pursuing since the fourth-quarter of 2015, are also expected to aid growth.The implementation of a new ERP system to improve core operations and the introduction of ""Matrix organization"" to smoothen flow of information are designed to remove the existing deficiencies hindering organizational performance. Additionally, the company's restructuring initiatives implemented in Dec 2015 in its U.K. market, catering to the film entertainment and merchandising industry, are likely to be conducive to top-line growth in the first quarter.In addition, the company's recently undertaken strategic expansionary drive in the Asian markets is expected to act as a tailwind for first-quarter 2016 performance. The previously announced joint venture partnership with Meimai in China in the fourth quarter of 2015 has helped Voxeljet to set up a direct operating presence in the foundry market of the country.Here are some other companies that you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Synopsys Inc.  , with an earnings ESP of +6.38% and Zacks Rank #2.

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Castlight Health operates as a provider of cloud-based software. It enables enterprises to gain control over their rapidly escalating health care costs.The company reported encouraging fourth-quarter results. Revenues increased on a year-over-year basis and the reported loss also narrowed from the year-ago figure. Subscription revenues during the quarter came in at $19.9 million, up 50% on a year-over-year basis.Castlight Health's non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 58.6%, up from 58.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth in gross margin was primarily due to a higher revenue base.Furthermore, significant investments in growth areas for improving implementation timelines, particularly with upsell products will boost profitability going forward.However, competition from form the likes of Medidata Solutions, Inc.  , Aetna Inc. and Merge Healthcare Incorporated remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Castlight Health is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for Castlight Health is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 21 cents per share. Castlight Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the 3D printer business, the majority of customers have moved toward the lower-priced uPrint, which may affect the company's margins in the upcoming quarters.

In the last quarter, the company suffered a loss of $3.89 million compared with a loss of $4.57 million reported in the year-ago period.Nevertheless, the company has been able to significantly increase its revenues on a year-over-year basis and the trend should continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Additionally, the software solutions market for small-to-medium sized businesses is projected to reach $125 billion in 2016.

It deploys its proprietary Content & Media platform to Demand Media's owned and operated websites.Declining desktop traffic and the company's shift from direct display advertising to lower-margin Marketplaces revenues are likely to hurt margins.

This facilitates contact center operations focused on inbound or outbound customer interactions within a single unified architecture. The company offers software products such as workforce management, speech recognition, predictive dialer, and voice applications.The cloud-based contact center solution industry is witnessing growth over the past several quarters as organizations are looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support. We believe that Five9 has been capitalizing on this opportunity, which should be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Furthermore, the company's sustained focus on expanding its product portfolio will boost top-line performance.However, intensifying competition from small and large players, such as Cisco Systems  , is likely to affect Five9's first-quarter performance.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Five9 is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the upcoming release.

e expect  to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 5.Our proven model shows that Alibaba Groupis likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. :  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +23.68%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Alibaba Grouphas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Alibaba Group's Zacks Rank #3 and +23.68% ESP makes us reasonably confident in looking for an earnings beat.The Chinese e-Commerce operates as a platform for third-party sellers and does not sell goods directly to merchants or hold inventory. Alibaba Group's strong market position in China, solid growth in mobile business, continued improvement in commerce retail business and improving gross merchandise value (GMV) should boost fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.Additionally, Alibaba is witnessing increasing monetization rates. The company's focus on foreign brands and other high-quality merchants on its platforms continue to increase its online marketing inventory on both mobile and PC. As a result of a higher monetization rate, its profits also improve.Some of the current buoyancy surrounding the shares is related to the Chinese e-Commerce goliath's dominance in the mobile search market and continued product development efforts.Alibaba Groupis not the only firm looking up this earnings season.

The company offers several products that protect passwords, close loopholes in security systems, and secure cloud-based assets.It is worth noting that CyberArk had delivered strong fourth-quarter 2015 results. Adjusted earnings of 30 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents, while revenues of $51.5 million exceeded our estimate of $44 million.The company stated that a strong network security market had helped them win a large number of deals and expand customer base, which contributed to its tremendous growth.We are encouraged by CyberArk's sustained focus on offering industry-leading solutions and go-to-market business model.Furthermore, demand for cyber security is on the rise. With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting a bring-your-own-device policy, which has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, but made it all the more necessary to enforce stricter data security measures.According to the research firm, Markets and Markets, the cyber security space is expected to reach $170.21 billion by 2020 from $106.32 billion in 2015, growing at an annual rate of 9.8%. We believe that CyberArk Software is in a favorable position to tap the opportunities.Our proven model does not conclusively show that CyberArk Software is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

e expect  , a leading manufacturer of wearable health and fitness tracking devices, to beat expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results on May 4.Our proven model shows that Fitbit is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Fitbit has the right combination of two key components. Fitbit currently has an Earnings ESP of +175.0%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at earnings of 3 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 4 cents. : Fitbit currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with an ESP of +175.0% make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Fitbit posted solid fourth-quarter results with both the top line and the bottom line exceeding the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Several factors are expected to drive results in the first quarter. Fitbit is rolling out Blaze and Alta on a global scale. This will, most likely result in additional manufacturing and marketing costs in the first quarter that will not impact revenues until the second quarter. So there will be significant pressure on earnings.On a positive note, there is significant untapped potential in China that Fitbit can target with its recent partnership with Tmall. The deal, which is expected to facilitate the distribution of Fitbit products in China encompasses devices, apps, social and motivational features, advice and personalized coaching. The personal coaching will be designed to bring behavioral changes in exercise, food, sleep and weight management thereby making the company a top fitness brand in the region with 10 million plus fans as soon as possible.For the first quarter Fitbit expects revenue between $420 million and $440 million. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is expected between breakeven to 2 cents.Fitbit is not the only firm looking up this earnings season.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zillow offers mobile and web solutions that enable users to find important information about homes. The company reported modest fourth quarter results. Although the company posted a loss during the quarter, its revenues witnessed tremendous year-over-year growth.We believe that strong traffic growth, frequent product launches and the growing Agent business are positives. In particular, product launches like Zillow Real Estate and Zillow Digs App for Apple Inc.'s  iPhone and iPad are expected drive growth.Moreover, the Trulia acquisition will not only make Zillow the number one online real estate information provider in the U.S., but also help it to compete against Move Inc., which has now been acquired by News Corp.Apart from acquisitions, Zillow entered into several partnerships with real estate listing companies and real estate brokers to enhance its product portfolio. However, the company is currently in the high investment phase and therefore profitability might be an issue in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Zillow is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Broadridge reported better-than-expected second-quarter results.

This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 49 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Broadridge holds a Zacks Rank #3.

With respect to earnings surprise, the stock has a positive four-quarter average of 12.62%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.HubSpot offers inbound marketing software platform that helps companies attract traffic to their websites, convert visitors into leads and close leads into customers. We are encouraged by the company's focus on investing in product development and international expansion, which should boost the top line in the first quarter.Notably, HubSpot's total customer base grew more than 33% on a year-over-year basis to 18,116 in the fourth quarter. Moreover, average subscription revenue per customer increased to $11,135 in the fourth quarter from $9,530 a year ago. This trend should continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Additionally, during fourth-quarter 2015 earnings results, HubSpot provided an encouraging guidance, which makes us more optimistic about the company's first quarter performance.However, we remain cautious about the bottom line in the first quarter owing to higher customer acquisition costs.Our proven model does not conclusively show that HubSpot is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

e expect electronic component distributor  to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2016 results on May 3. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.59%. Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of 1.32%Our proven model shows that Arrow Electronics is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.42%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. Arrow Electronics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 or #3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Sell-rated stocks (#4 or #5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Arrow Electronics' Zacks Rank #2 and +1.42% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat on May 3.The stock closed at $62.10 last Friday. We expect earnings beat in the first quarter to positively influence the stock price.Arrow Electronics' strong distribution channels are being preferred by original equipment manufacturers, contract manufacturers and commercial customers for marketing. The company's core strength in providing best-in-class services and easy-to-acquire technologies will act as growth catalysts in the to-be reported quarter.Moreover, the company has secured a significant market share through a broad portfolio of products and services, and continued efforts to maximize consumer satisfaction. Additionally, incremental sales from strategic acquisitions are expected to boost Arrow's top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company acquired four businesses in 2015, namely ATM Electronic Corporation, immixGroup Inc., RDC and Data Modul AG.Additionally, during fourth-quarter 2015 earnings results, Arrow Electronics provided an encouraging guidance, which makes us more optimistic about the company's first quarter performance.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Synopsys Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +6.38% and a Zacks Rank #1.Fitbit Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +175.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Benefitfocus Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We remain positive about Paylocity's regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably, over the past few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company's SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of the revenues. Therefore, we believe that regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost the company's top line over the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have a positive impact on the upcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity's ACA dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind over the long run.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , Oracle Corporation and SAP SE remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paylocity is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

"etworking giant  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 10.This key player in the field of telecommunications has an impressive history with respect to earnings per share having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat is 30.21%.However, things do not look rosy for Nokia as far as the first
quarter is concerned.However, things do not look rosy for Nokia as far as the first quarter is concerned.Our quantitative model too doesn't point to an earnings beat. Here's why:Nokia doesn't have the right combination of the two key ingredients - positive  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better - for increasing the odds of an earnings surprise. The Earnings ESP for Nokia is -66.67%, as the Most Accurate estimate is 2 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3 cents. Nokia carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that, we caution against Sell-rated stocks going into an earnings announcement, especially if the company has been seeing negative estimate revisions.We expect results to be impacted by foreign currency movements. Sales are expected to be soft in certain key markets like China in the first quarter which will impact the top line. The Nokia Networks Segment is expected to face the brunt of the headwinds, which will likely result in below-par sales.Moreover, escalated costs should hurt the bottom line. Focus will be on the integration process of the Nokia-Alcatel-Lucent entity. The telecom giant officially took over rival Alcatel-Lucent in Jan 2016 -- the deal which was first announced in April last year.With Nokia focusing on the growth by acquisition strategy, we expect an update on the issue during the first-quarter conference call. Last month, Nokia announced intentions to buy Withings S.A. The transaction, valued at EUR 170 million, will be settled in cash. The deal is expected to close by Sep 30, 2016. Through this move, Nokia aims to enter the highly lucrative digital health market.With Nokia likely to disappoint, we present below some players in the broader Computer & Technology sector that are worth considering, as our model shows these too have the right combination of elements to clock an earnings beat:Agilent Technologies  has an earnings ESP of +2.56% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report second-quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 16.Synopsys  has an earnings ESP of +6.38% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 is scheduled to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 4. Last quarter, the company posted a loss of 26 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 32 cents.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Workiva offers a cloud-based mobile-enabled platform for enterprises to collect, manage, report and analyze critical business data in real time. The exponential increase in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals have compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors.Cloud computing includes the entire gamut of computing intelligence required to carry out day-to-day operations by companies and professionals. Thus, other than the hardware, all the supporting technology involved in creating, storing, retrieving, transporting, protecting, sorting, processing, analyzing and presenting information from multiple sources and formats, which when available from a shared (private) or public pool, could be referred to as cloud computing.Cloud service providers, therefore, help organizations to store data and applications remotely in this pool, which can be accessed from anywhere, anytime via the Internet. Given its scope and advantages (cost, scaling, convenience, etc.), demand for cloud computing software and applications will continue to increase. This will aid Workiva's results in the first quarter and beyond.According to Centaur Partners, Software-as-a-Service and cloud-based business applications are likely to grow from $13.5 billion in 2013 to $32.8 billion in 2016, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 19.5%. Workiva is poised well to cash in on this opportunity.We believe that increasing mainstream adoption of cloud-based solutions will boost Workiva's first-quarter results.However, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and competition remain major concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Workiva will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

It offers tools for software developers consisting of FishEye, Bamboo and SourceTree. Atlassian is headquartered in Sydney, Australia.Atlassian held its IPO on Dec 9, 2015. The company posted modest second-quarter 2016 results, with its top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line matching the same.We believe that continuous investments in product development (mainly the launch of three purpose-built versions of JIRA products) coupled with higher total customer count on an active subscription or maintenance agreement are a few of the positives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Atlassian is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release.

 is scheduled to release first-quarter 2016 earnings on May 5, after market close.In the fourth quarter of 2015, Motorola Solutions had posted a positive earnings surprise of 7.14%. In fact, the company has an impressive track record with respect to earnings, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 24.67%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.This Schaumburg, Illinois-based company is expected to grapple with foreign currency issues on the revenue front in the first quarter, as has been the case in the preceding quarter. Mirroring this apprehension, Motorola Solutions anticipates a 4% to 6% decline in revenues in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis (assuming a $20 million adverse currency impact).However, the acquisition of Airwave Solutions Ltd, completed in February this year, will boost results in the quarter. Moreover, the company's efforts to reward shareholders through dividends/buybacks encourage us. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company returned $239 million to shareholders through buybacks ($179 million) and dividend payments ($60 million). We expect an update on the Airwave Solutions integration process and the company's shareholder friendly activities during the first-quarter conference call.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Motorola Solutions is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below: : The ESP for the company stands at 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents per share. : Motorola Solutions has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP.

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 4. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 5.32%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Equinix operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management should drive revenues in the first quarter.Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and have helped it to expand data center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. We expect the company's buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo to boost the top line in the quarter.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones has been an important part of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that Equinix's focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues as well as profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays which may hurt Equinix's first quarter as well as the full-year profitability. In Mar 2016, the company announced an aggressive expansion plan for the year. To this end, the company has targeted investment worth more than $4.5 billion this year. This will include opening of data centers, expansion of colocation space and acquisitions.Moreover, increasing competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT&T  , Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon will affect product pricing, thereby denting margins.Additionally, the telecommunications industry is undergoing consolidation. As customers combine businesses, the requirement for co-location space will decline, thus affecting Equinix's overall growth prospects.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix will beat estimates this quarter.

We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  , a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Rambus Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #Array (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

" is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2015 results on May 2, before the market opens.Last quarter, Cablevision Systems delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.25%. Moreover, the company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 6.83%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc.  , Amazon.com Inc.  , YouTube, etc. have become major threats for cable TV operators like Cablevision. Online videos provide an extremely cheap source of TV programming unless the customer is keen on viewing real-time programs like sporting events. This business model is gaining momentum, especially amid volatile economic conditions.Cablevision is consistently focusing on its WiFi network, referred to as the ""Optimum WiFi Network"", for growth. The company has activated WiFi across its entire service area and has roughly 1.5 million WiFi hotspots active throughout its entire service area. Additionally, Cablevision expects ongoing investments in the Wi-Fi network to continue enhancing the value of its Freewheel service.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cablevision Systems is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as elaborated below. Cablevision Systems has Earnings ESP of -5.88%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 16 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 17 cents. Cablevision Systems has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a company you may want to consider, as our model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Synopsys Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +7.27% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n a move to tap the growing demand for software security solutions across the Asia-Pacific region,  recently announced its decision to showcase the Software Integrity Platform at the Black Hat Asia event. The program is scheduled to be held from Mar 29 to Apr 1 in Singapore.Synopsys' Software Integrity Platform provides a complete suite of software security testing solutions for software signoff. The platform enables organizations to detect and fix ""critical security vulnerabilities throughout the software development lifecycle and supply chain"" quickly, thereby reducing overall risks, costs and time.According to the company, ""The Software Integrity Platform enables robust application security testing for software ranging from enterprise web applications to embedded software and IoT devices. The platform is designed to facilitate ""software signoff,"" a unique and rigorous approach introduced by Synopsys to secure software with integrated development and testing processes.""Synopsys expects that the need for security testing solutions will grow rapidly in the Asia-Pacific region supported by the growing number of software companies.Synopsys sells electronic design automation software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. Apart from this, the company entered into software security market in 2014 with the acquisition of Coverity, a software quality, testing and security tools provider. Since then it has been trying to expand its capabilities in the security space through various buyouts such as, Seeker, Codenomicon, Goanna and Protecode.In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies, which have led to higher adoption of Synopsys' products. Notably, the company's first-quarter fiscal 2016 revenues witnessed 4.9% year-over-year increase driven by higher adoption.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, its unique intellectual properties and global support will drive results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  , a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is MicroStrategy Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" provider of human capital management software as a service,  is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 3. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.5%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Paycom Software reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results, with its top and bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were favorable.Revenue growth seems to be steady and was positively impacted by higher recurring revenues and higher traction in cloud-based offerings. Better-than-expected demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions during the reported quarter were the other positives.We believe that higher traction of Paycom Software's Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") dashboard application that tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind for the company. Also, Paycom Software might witness long-term growth by successfully cross-selling newer products to the existing client base, which will boost revenues,.Nevertheless, competition from companies like Paylocity Holding Corporation  , Intuit Inc. and Paychex, Inc. remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paycom Software is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below. The Earnings ESP for Paycom Software is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at 20 cents per share. Paycom Software has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which are worth considering as our model shows that they have the right combination of the two elements needed to post an earnings beat:Synopsys Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +6.38% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Fitbit Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +175.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2016 results on Feb 17. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 8.82%. However, it is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 53.22%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys witnessed significant year-over-year improvement in fourth-quarter revenues primarily on the back of higher adoption of its products and several acquisitions. The bottom line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company provided tepid first-quarter and fiscal 2016 revenue guidance.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe that the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results in the first quarter. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive the results.

egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.8, after changing hands as low as $44.82 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 33.3. A bullish investor could look at SNPS's 29.8 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of SNPS shares:    Looking at the chart above, SNPS's low point in its 52 week range is $41.60 per share, with $52.78 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $44.81.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SNPS makes up 1.44% of the iShares North American Tech-Software ETF (Symbol: IGV) which is trading lower by about 0.7% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Synopsys is Now Oversold (SNPS)@2015-12-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-now-oversold-snps-2015-12-14
"rowing through strategic acquisitions has been one of the key strategies of  . Keeping with this, the company recently announced the buyout of Goanna Software. However, the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.Australian-based Goanna offers static code analysis tools that meet the industry coding standards and compliances which improve the code quality while reducing security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the integration of Goanna will enable Synopsys to enhance its static code analysis solution capabilities.Currently, Synopsys provides static code analysis solutions under the Coverity product suite. The recent acquisition will improve Coverity's analysis capabilities while enhancing security and quality.Furthermore, Synopsys in its press release revealed that ""[it] will leverage Goanna Software's technology to improve the Coverity Software Development Kit (SDK) to enable customers to more easily develop dedicated static analysis rules and checkers for their specific use cases"".Therefore, we believe that Goanna will enable Synopsys to offer a more comprehensive portfolio of software solutions. Moreover, through the acquisition Synopsys will gain the former's customers thereby boosting the top line.The recent acquisition is in line with Synopsys' continued investments toward enhancing the software security product portfolio. To strengthen its presence in the software security market, the company acquired Codenomicon Oy and Elliptic Technologies in June.Moreover, Synopsys has taken over certain assets of Quotium Technologies, including the Quotium Seeker product and the R&D team. We believe that these acquisitions will enhance its presence in this market while expanding the product portfolio and quality of its wholly owned subsidiary, Coverity.Synopsys sells electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships while focusing on cost efficiencies, and many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Acquisitions have helped Synopsys to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Also, since intensifying competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate into, acquisitions have boosted the company's revenues. The company recently reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results wherein revenues witnessed a year-over-year increase of 8.9%.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will aid results, going ahead. Apart from this, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will drive results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"torage and data management solutions provider  has completed the buyout of SolidFire Inc. for $870 million in cash. The acquisition was announced on Dec 21, 2015.The acquisition will surely enhance the market value of NetApp. It is expected to augment NetApp's leadership position by enhancing its product portfolio with an object-based storage software offering.Founded in 2010, SolidFire is a global leader in flash storage systems for faster access to insights from Big Data. SolidFire's unique products are built specially to assure true Quality of Service (QoS) and have garnered significant attention in the flash storage market in recent times.According to the press release, ""Customers now have access to the industry's broadest all-flash portfolio to meet their needs for speed, scale and data services. Over time, SolidFire products will be incorporated into NetApp's Data Fabric strategy, delivering seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud resources.""SolidFire's all-flash storage systems will largely complement NetApp's product suite. The acquisition will extend NetApp's flash leadership position, which in turn will allow its customers to analyze fast-growing storage infrastructure.The company faces competition from tech giants such as International Business Machines  and EMC Corporation  in the data storage and management software space. We believe this acquisition will give it a much-needed competitive edge to create its own niche.SolidFire's flash storage arrays, instead of focusing on improving cache performance, act as primary storage for applications requiring high speed, such as cloud computing and virtualization. This simplifies the storage system while decreasing fetching time, thereby increasing speed.Further, SolidFire's flash arrays are built on Next Generation Data Centers that simplify data center operations and enable rapid deployments of new applications. These features make it more cost effective in our view.NetApp has a dominant position in the flash storage market. According to a Bloomberg report, NetApp's flash storage sales amounted to approximately $100 million in 2014. The acquisition is expected to boost NetApp's flash based storage product portfolio going forward. We believe that the acquisition will expand NetApp's customer base and market share due to higher demand from enterprises going forward.However, soft demand from U.S. federal agencies and constricted IT spending in general remain headwinds.This apart, over the last 60 days, three analysts have lowered their estimate for NetApp's fiscal 2016. There were no upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate declined 3.7% to $1.57 per share over the same time frame.NetApp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 3, before the market opens.Last quarter, Harris had posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.56%. Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 7.08%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect the company's revenues to remain under pressure in the third quarter due to foreign currency issues. However, the Exelis acquisition, completed last year, will boost results in the quarter. This was the third full quarter at Harris following the closure of the Exelis acquisition. With effect from the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the company has been reporting results through four operating units, namely, Communication Systems, Critical Networks, Electronic Systems and Space and Intelligence Systems. We expect a commentary on the integration process of the Exelis acquisition at the conference call.Moreover, Harris has won multiple contracts in the recent past which is expected to aid results. However, it is worth noting that the company primarily depends on U.S. government contracts for a major portion of its revenues.

That is not the case here, as you will see below: : The ESP for the company stands at 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 per share. : Harris has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP.

hares of  have generated a return of 14.6% over the last one year. The company also delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.7% in the last reported quarter.The price appreciation can be attributed to Synopsys' efforts to provide customers with increased hardware efficiency, enabling significant reductions in both CPU memory consumption and manufacturing turnaround time.Synopsys' time-based license revenue model also showed solid momentum during third-quarter fiscal 2015, contributing more than 80% to total revenue. The growth can be attributed to an increase in TSL license revenues due to contributions from the acquired companies. Under this system, customers effectively rent the software, rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee. Hence this is a much more predictable revenue model, providing better visibility through a steady and recurring revenue stream. Also, the company has come up with new software offerings, especially targeted toward companies like Toshiba and Juniper, facilitating their production process.Synopsys has also made a few important acquisitions to build its product portfolio and stimulate growth. Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and are helping it to gain access to newer markets and technologies. Also, since intense competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, acquisitions have helped the company to boost revenues. In July this year, Synopsys acquired Bluetooth Smart IP from Silicon Vision - a leading provider of high-performance, ultra-low-power wireless IP solutions. Acquisitions are likely to enable Synopsys to enter markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain its leading position. Moreover, the company's continued acquisitions are expected to make a good contribution to its revenue stream.Apart from this, Synopsys also collaborated with ARM Holdings plc. which is expected to optimize the performance of its processors. Collaborations with this intellectual property (IP) suite provider have helped the company strengthen its product portfolio and improve the design quality of its custom integrated circuits.Furthermore, Synopsys returns cash to investors through share repurchases. In Dec 2014, the company announced an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2015 ASR) worth $180 million of its common stock under a share repurchase program, which it completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Share buybacks are a good way to return cash to investors when growth opportunities are limited. These also have a positive effect on earnings per share.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  along with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keeps us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Amazon.com Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 27.5, after changing hands as low as $43.39 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 34.7. A bullish investor could look at SNPS's 27.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

Consequently, operating margin contracted 270 bps to 15.9% due to technical complication in-built in the customers' design processes.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis was $78.8 million or 50 cents per share compared with $87.5 million or 55 cents a year ago.The company reported GAAP net income of $55.4 million or 35 cents per share compared with $65.7 million or 42 cents per share in third-quarter fiscal 2014.Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.122 billion compared with $1.005 billion at the end of the previous quarter.

 recently announced the acquisition of Bluetooth Smart IP from Silicon Vision - a leading provider of high-performance, ultra-low-power wireless IP solutions - in keeping with its strategy of growing through acquisitions. However, the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.The integration of Bluetooth Smart IP will enable Synopsys to offer wireless connectivity solutions to a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications that include wearables, beacons, portable health, smart home, industrial and wireless sensor networks. Moreover, through the acquisition, Synopsys will gain Bluetooth Smart IP's customers thereby boosting its top line.According to Synopsys, Bluetooth Smart technology facilitates wireless communication between several IoT-enabled devices with extremely low power consumption. Developers and OEMs can also create solutions for numerous Bluetooth Smart Ready products using the technology.The acquisition will broaden Synopsys' extensive portfolio of DesignWare IP for IoT applications. Under the portfolio, the company provides a wide range of IP solutions for IoT, including logic libraries, embedded memory compilers, non-volatile memory, data converters, wired and wireless interface IP, security IP, processor cores, and a sensor and control IP subsystem.The Bluetooth Smart IP buyout is in line with the company's continued investment toward enhancing the DesignWare IP product portfolio. To strengthen its presence in this category, the company, in June, acquired Elliptic Technologies, a leading provider of security IP cores and software solutions.Synopsys sells electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies, and many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and help it gain access to newer markets and technologies. Some of its notable buyouts include Codenomicon, Coverity and Target Compiler Technologies.Also, since intensifying competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, acquisitions have helped Synopsys to boost revenues. The company witnessed a year-over-year increase of 7.6% in second-quarter fiscal 2015 revenues.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Nuance Communications, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

 is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Aug 19. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.38%. It is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 78.74%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys' second-quarter top line witnessed a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's earnings also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Recently, Synopsys announced the acquisition of Bluetooth Smart IP from Silicon Vision - a leading provider of high-performance, ultra-low-power wireless IP solutions - in line with its strategy of growing through acquisitions. Moreover, through the acquisition, Synopsys will gain Bluetooth Smart IP's customers thereby boosting its top line.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries.

Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp. coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 30 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Synopsys' Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Intuit Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +32.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)Seadrill Partners LLC  with an Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n an effort to broaden its product portfolio and expand globally,  recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire Atrenta Inc., a SoC realization solutions provider for the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries. However, the financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.Atrenta is a well known name in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry and enjoys a leading position among static and formal technology providers that cater to various design and verification teams across the world. The company claims that its solutions SpyGlass, GenSys and BugScope enhance the efficiency in SoC design and verification.Synopsys intends to integrate Atrenta's complementary static verification and implementation technology with its Verification Continuum and Galaxy Design platforms. The integration will facilitate Synopsys in offering a more comprehensive portfolio of software solutions to designers.Moreover, through the acquisition Synopsys will gain Atrenta's customers thereby boosting its top line. The deal is expected to be completed this summer subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.Synopsys sells EDA software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. In the current economic scenario, customers are strengthening their supplier relationships and focusing on cost efficiencies, and many have selected Synopsys as their primary EDA partner.Acquisitions are central to the company's growth strategy and help it gain to access to newer markets and technologies. Some of its recent notable buyouts include Codenomicon, Coverity and Target Compiler Technologies.Also, since intensifying competition is making the EDA market tougher to penetrate, acquisitions have helped the company to boost revenues. The company has recently reported the second-quarter fiscal 2015 results wherein revenues witnessed a year-over-year increase of 7.6%.We believe that the company's sustained focus on product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp.  coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is Advent Software Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

ontinuing with its earnings streak,  has once again posted better-than-expected results in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The company's adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) of 56 cents, on a proportionate tax basis, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents.However, non-GAAP earnings remained flat with the year-ago quarter as the benefit from higher revenues and lower operating expenses were fully offset by increased cost of sales and taxes. On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 35 cents per share compared with 41 cents in the year-ago period.Total revenue increased 7.6% year over year to $557.2 million and came ahead of the company's guidance range of $543-$553 million as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $547 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products.The company witnessed revenue growth across all its business segments. License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $492.2 million, up nearly 7% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues increased 13.7% year over year to $65.1 million.More than 90% of the second-quarter revenues came from backlog. A single customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenues.Adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) was $457.8 million, up approximately 6.7% from the year-ago period. However, as a percentage of revenues, it contracted 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 82.2%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis to $346.4 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, the same decreased 180 bps from the year-ago quarter to 62.2% mainly due to delayed hiring.Synopsys' adjusted operating income jumped 13.5% on a year-over-year basis to $111.4 million, primarily due to operational efficiency coupled with higher revenue base. Consequently, operating margin improved 100 bps to 20%.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis was $88.7 million or 56 cents per share compared with $88.1 million or 56 cents a year ago. The year-over-year flat bottom line was mainly due to increased cost of sales and taxes which fully offsets the benefit of higher revenue base and improved operational efficiency.The company reported GAAP net income of $55.6 million or 35 cents per share compared with $63.3 million or 40 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2014.Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.005 billion compared with $917.1 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $338.4 million compared with $283 million in the last quarter. Long-term debt was $30 million. During the first two quarters of fiscal 2015, the company generated a cash flow of $67.7 million from operational activities and repurchased stocks worth $144 million.Buoyed by the strong second-quarter performance, Synopsys raised the fiscal 2015 guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $2.210-$2.235 billion, up from $2.15-$2.235 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $2.76 and $2.81 up from $2.75-$2.80. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.222 billion and $1.46 per share, respectively. The company maintained its cash from operations guidance of approximately $450 million.For third-quarter fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $550-$560 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses within $430-$440 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 58-60 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents.Synopsys second-quarter top line witnessed a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, we are encouraged by the company's bullish fiscal 2015 guidance.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries.

 is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on May 20. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 195.65%. It is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 74.73%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys kicked off 2015 on a strong note with both the top and bottom lines witnessing a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though total revenue marginally fell short of the same.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and Mentor Graphics Corp. coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 32 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Synopsys' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Intuit Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Splunk, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) saw new options become available this week, for the April 17th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SNPS options chain for the new April 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 15 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SNPS, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.81/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.33% return on the cash commitment, or 2.34% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of SNPS stock at the current price level of $46.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.92% if the stock gets called away at the April 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SNPS shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Synopsys Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SNPS's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.11% boost of extra return to the investor, or 0.75% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 18%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 20%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $46.81) to be 17%.

hares of  (  ) gained over 5% in after-hours trade yesterday following the company's robust first-quarter fiscal 2015 results and bullish fiscal year guidance. The company's first-quarter adjusted earnings per share (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis of 68 cents increased 36% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents.However, on a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 41 cents per share compared with 43 cents in the year-ago period.Total revenue increased 13.2% year over year to $542 million and was toward the higher-end of the company's guidance range of $535-$545 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products. However, the company's total revenue marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $544 million.The company witnessed revenue growth across all its business segments. License revenues (including time-based and upfront) were $477.5 million, up nearly 10% from the year-ago quarter. Maintenance and service revenues increased 44% year over year to $64.5 million.More than 90% of the first-quarter revenues came from backlog. A single customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenues.Adjusted gross profit (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) was $443.4 million, up approximately 12% from the year-ago period. However, as a percentage of revenues, it contracted 90 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 81.8%.Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) increased 2.6% on a year-over-year basis to $324.9 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, the same decreased 620 bps from the year-ago quarter to 59.9% mainly due to a shift in the timing of expenses, delayed hiring and lower travelling and professional expenses.Synopsys' adjusted operating income jumped 49.6% on a year-over-year basis to $118.3 million, primarily due to operational efficiency coupled with higher revenue base. Consequently, operating margin improved 530 bps to 21.8%.Adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding all one-time items) on a proportionate tax basis was $107.2 million or 68 cents per share compared with $80.7 million or 50 cents a year ago.The company reported GAAP net income of $65.2 million or 41 cents per share compared with $67.7 million or 43 cents per share in first-quarter fiscal 2014.Synopsys exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $917.1 million compared with $985.8 million at the end of the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $283 million compared with $326.7 million in the last quarter. Long-term debt was $37.5 million. The company used cash of $87.3 million for operating activities. During the quarter, Synopsys repurchased $144 million worth of its common stock.Buoyed by the strong first-quarter performance, Synopsys raised the fiscal 2015 guidance. The company now expects revenues in the range of $2.15-$2.235 billion, up from its earlier guidance range of $2.185-$2.225 billion. Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share are now projected between $2.75 and $2.80 up from $2.67-$2.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.221 billion and $1.33 per share, respectively. The company maintained its cash from operations guidance of approximately $450 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $543-$553 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $538 million. The company expects non-GAAP expenses in the range of $418-$428 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 62-64 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents.Synopsys kicked off 2015 on a strong note with both the top line and the bottom line witnessed a significant year-over-year improvement. The improvement came mainly on the back of higher adoption of Synopsys' products and effective cost management. The company's bottom line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though total revenue marginally fell short of the same. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the company's bullish fiscal 2015 guidance.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand its reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. (  ) and Mentor Graphics Corp. (  ) coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Currently, Synopsys has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is DST Systems Inc. (  ), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hicago, IL - April 01, 2015 - Stocks in this week's article include:  -  -  -  -  and  -  . Kevin Matras shows why stocks with new analyst coverage are stocks you want to have.Given the recent run-up in the market, here's a screen I've been using recently for my own stock picking.First, it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries. Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buys and Holds, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And that's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:• We're screening for only those stocks with the best (lowest) average Zacks Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sectors give us the best 50% of sectors.• Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru. Since there are 264 'X' or expanded industries we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru. If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it's outside of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.• Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s. No Sells or Strong Sells (Zacks Rank #4s and #5s) allowed.• Only stocks over $5 with at least an average of 100,0000 shares traded daily will be considered.• This means we're screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.• Then finally we're scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market, they increased in price less than their peers.So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector. This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks, you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from.And from that list of winners, we're selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list. Remember, these stocks aren't 'dogs' or unresponsive stocks. Quite the contrary; they have all outperformed the market. It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list. But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry, we've singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It's an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names.Here are 5 from that list:(  -  ) Synopsys(  -  ) WebMD Health(  -  ) Aircastle(  -  ) Marten Transport(  -  ) Cross Country HealthcareAll great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

Further, she has also been associated with Ancestry.com LLC, the UCLA Anderson School of Management, Montalvo Arts Center and Illuminate Ventures as a supporting leader.Given her experience with technology firms and her understanding of Synopsys' business, she will likely contribute to the company's growth.We believe that Chaffin will employ better strategies and take Synopsys to newer heights in the changing demand scenario.Synopsys recently announced mixed fourth quarter 2014 results wherein its adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents cruised way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents.Moreover, benefitting from higher adoption of Synopsys' products and the Coverity acquisition, the company's sales jumped 6.8% to $539 million.The company provided an encouraging first-quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance. For the first-quarter of fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $535 million-$545 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $544 million. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 61 cents-63 cents, much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents per share.For fiscal 2015, the company expects revenues in the range of $2.185 billion-$2.225 billion, while non-GAAP earnings per share are projected within $2.67-$2.72.

Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand Synopsys' reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc.

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Xylem Inc. (Symbol: XYL), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), the market cap is now $6.51B, versus Xylem Inc. (Symbol: XYL) at $6.49B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SNPS vs. XYL (Note that we have found 2 splits in the  ):Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SNPS and XYL collectively make up 1.75% of the Guggenheim Mid-Cap Core ETF (  ) which is lower by about 2% on the day Monday.At the closing bell, SNPS is down about 1.3%, while XYL is off about 6.2% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Synopsys Larger Than S&P 500 Component Xylem@2015-01-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-larger-sp-500-component-xylem-2015-01-05
 (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Dec 3. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 57.1%. It is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 38.7%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys delivered modest fiscal third-quarter 2014 results. Both earnings and revenues improved on a year-over-year basis driven by increased adoption of Synopsys' products and the Coverity acquisition.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will back its quarterly results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand Synopsys' reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.It's worth mentioning that Synopsys' recent collaboration with companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, ARM Holdings and Intel Corp will help it to build and improve chips and electronic systems, thereby driving growth.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corp. coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding proper time to realize acquisition synergies are concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 36 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Synopsys' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Esterline Technologies Corp. (  ), with Earnings ESP of +5.35% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Red Hat, Inc. (  ), with Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2Adobe Systems Inc.

hares of  (  ) are trending up post the company's better-than-expected third-quarter earnings reported on Oct 23, 2014.PDF Solutions reported adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding expenses related to impairment, amortization, restructuring and a non-cash portion of income tax expense) of 12 cents that comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4 cents.Nevertheless, PDF Solutions' earnings and revenues declined on a year-over-year basis.PDF Solutions' Design-to-Silicon-Yield solutions revenues of $10.9 million were down 36.2% year over year more than offset the 36.3% increase in Gainshare revenues to $11.5 million. This resulted in a 12.1% decline in total revenue for the quarter which came in at $22.4 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter was pegged at $22 million.It is worth noting that 94% of total revenue came from PDF Solutions' top 10 customers. Geographically, 41% of revenues came from Europe, 47% from North America and the remaining 12% was contributed by Asia.Gross margins for the quarter came in at 56.6% compared with 58.8% reported in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower revenue base. Operating expenses (excluding amortization and restructuring expenses) came in at $7.8 million, up 8.9% year over year, while operating income decreased 37.8% year over year to $4.8 million. Operating margins came in at 21.6% compared with 30.5% in the year-ago quarter.PDF Solutions reported adjusted net income (including stock-based compensation but excluding expenses related to impairment, amortization, restructuring and a non-cash portion of income tax expense) of $4.1 million or 12 cents compared with $6.7 million or 21 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $116.1 million compared with $106.9 million in the previous quarter. Deferred revenues were $2.6 million compared with $3.4 million in the previous quarter. The company did not have any long-term debt.Despite PDF Solutions' better-than-expected third-quarter results, the year-over-year comparisons were unfavorable. Results were impacted due to delays in contract signings which were primarily responsible for the tepid top-line performance.Nonetheless, the increasing user engagement and multi-year contracts with customers are expected to remain the growth catalysts in the next few quarters. Particularly so because the ongoing technology transitions in the semiconductor industry require the qualification and testing of processes, which increases demand for PDF Solutions' software solutions and services.PDF Solutions' customers include leading foundries like GlobalFoundries and Samsung that are currently trying to improve the yield of their new processes. Therefore, the company will likely see sales momentum.However, competition from Synopsys, Inc. (  ) and Rudolph Technologies Inc. (  ), and customer concentration remain the headwinds (top 10 customers contribute 94% of total revenue).Currently, PDF Solutions has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors may also look at SunEdison (  ) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

n Aug 21, 2014, shares of  (  ) scaled a 52-week high of $41.82 buoyed by a solid third-quarter earnings beat. Shares closed at $41.75 gaining 6.23% during intra-day trading. The current closing price represents a 1-year return of 13.39% and year-to-date return of 3.29%.In the third quarter of 2014, Synopsys' top and bottom line figures improved on a year-over-year basis. Revenues were positively impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products and the Coverity acquisition. Also, the company expects Coverity to be accretive in fiscal 2016.The company's margin expanded due to operational efficiency and cost control. It is worth mentioning that during the quarter, Synopsys collaborated with Intel Corp. (  ) to facilitate the adoption of Intel's 14-nanometer (nm) Tri-Gate process technology by Intel Custom Foundry customers.Synopsys also provided an encouraging revenue guidance range of $537.0-$547.0 million for the fourth quarter, up from $505 million reported in the year-ago comparable quarter. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 59-69 cents, higher than the 50 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the Coverity acquisition will expand Synopsys' reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. (  ) and Mentor Graphics Corp.

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example ADT Corp (Symbol: ADT), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), the market cap is now $6.23B, versus ADT Corp (Symbol: ADT) at $6.15B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SNPS vs. ADT (Note that we have found 2 splits in the  ):Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, SNPS is down about 1.1%, while ADT is off about 1.9% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Synopsys Larger Than S&P 500 Component ADT@2014-09-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-larger-sp-500-component-adt-2014-09-25

However, it is worth noting that Synopsys has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with a positive earnings surprise average of 33.9%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys reported mixed second-quarter 2014 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same. Revenues improved on a year-over-year basis, impacted by higher adoption of Synopsys' products.We believe the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisition of Coverity will expand Synopsys' reach in the software quality, testing and security tools market.It is worth mentioning that recently, Synopsys collaborated with Intel Corp (  ) to facilitate the adoption of Intel's 14 nanometer (nm) Tri-Gate process technology by Intel Custom Foundry customers.However, competition from Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corp. coupled with a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty regarding proper time to realize acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings this quarter.

hares of  (  ) were down 3.9% on Tuesday's trade post the company's tepid year over year top-line performance in the second quarter of 2014 reported on Monday (Jul 28, 2014). Also, the company's revenues of $24.6 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28 million.Nonetheless, PDF's earnings per share increased 7.2% year over year to 21 cents and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents.PDF's Design-to-Yield solutions revenues of $13.1 million were down 12.4% year over year which more than offset the 17.2% increase in Gainshare revenues which came in at $11.6 million. This resulted in a 0.7% decline in total revenue for the quarter which came in at $24.6 million.It is worth noting that 93% of total revenue came from PDF's top 10 customers. Geographically, 44% of revenues came from Europe, 41% from North America, and Asia accounted for the remaining 15%.Gross margins for the quarter came in at 64.1%, up from 30.6% reported in the year-ago quarter, due to lower costs. Operating expenses (excluding amortization and restructuring expenses) came in at $7.9 million, up 5.4% year over year, while operating income increased 4.3% year over year to $7.8 million. Operating margins came in at 31.6% compared with 30.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.PDF reported a 9.7% increase in net income (including share-based compensation but excluding amortization and restructuring) to $6.6 million.The company exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $106.9 million compared with $100.9 million in the previous quarter. Deferred revenues were $3.4 million compared with $4.5 million in the previous quarter. The company did not have any long-term debt on its balance sheet. The company generated $6.3 million operating cash flow during the quarter.PDF reported mixed second-quarter results wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line lagged the same. Delays in project executions remained the primary cause for the tepid top-line performance.Nonetheless, the increasing user engagement and multi-year contracts with customers are expected to remain the growth catalysts in the next few quarters. Particularly so because the ongoing technology transitions in the semiconductor industry require the qualification and testing of processes, which increases demand for PDF's software solutions and services.PDF's customers include leading foundries like GlobalFoundries and Samsung that are currently under great pressure to improve the yield of their new processes. Therefore, the company is likely to see sales momentum.However, competition from Synopsys, Inc. (  ) and Rudolph Technologies Inc.

"hares of  (  ) hit a 52-week high as the company reportedly announced that it was designed into 130 new Android and Windows-based tablets to launch this year (Intel intends to power 40 million tablets in 2014).But that isn't all - the chipmaker also collaborated with  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) to facilitate the adoption of its 14 nanometer (nm) Tri-Gate process technology by Intel Custom Foundry customers. The partnerships will boost its 14nm design platform for cloud infrastructure and mobile market applications. These alliances are an extension of the work on the Intel Custom Foundry 22nm process design platform to the 14nm platform.Intel's collaboration with Synopsis will enable an extensive System on a Chip (""SoC"") design for its custom foundry 14-nm Tri-Gate process technology. Building on the proven success of the companies' design enablement for Intel's 22-nm foundry process design platform, Intel has chosen Synopsys' design expertise and IP portfolio for its new 14-nm foundry process technology. Synopsis is a provider of electronic design automation (""EDA"") software products, intellectual property (""IP"") and services to build and improve chips and electronic systems.Following the collaboration with Cadence, Intel will gain the latter's LPDDR4-3200 PHY for its 14nm Low Power design platform. Cadence's technology will cater to high memory performance, efficient power and cost, and compact system demands of Intel's mobile market applications. Moreover, the collaboration will also help in the expansion of the Cadence digital flow design platform, which in turn will enable customers to leverage the power, performance and area advantages of Intel's 14nm process technology. Cadence provides EDA software and its software, hardware, IP, and services are utilized to design and verify semiconductor and electronics systems.Intel, as part of its partnership with ANSYS, will gain access to ANSYS simulation solutions, which will enable customers to use a production-proven, industry-leading reference flow for power, electromigration (""EM"") and reliability sign-off solution for its 14nm Tri-Gate process platform. ANSYS offers engineering simulation software and services to bring clarity and insight to complicated design challenges.Intel together with Mentor Graphics will offer models and rule decks for circuit simulation, design rule checking (""DRC"") and layout against schematic checking (""LVS"") for mobile and cloud applications. Intel will incorporate Mentor's standard circuit simulation, verification and sign-off technology with 14nm design platform. This will enable customers to offer optimized designs for process-specific needs, thereby providing leading cycle time and physical verification precision. Mentor Graphics provides EDA software and hardware solutions, products and consulting services for electro-mechanical and semiconductor systems.Intel's Tri-Gate technology is a proprietary 3D transistor technology and its 14nm transistor technology for SoC is a highly developed and enhanced version of the Tri-Gate process technology. These transistors enable efficient and high performance chips compared to the earlier generations of transistors. Therefore, this allows chip designers to select transistors for low power or high performance, based on the applications.Intel has previously stated that its foundry partnerships are strategic agreements. These partnerships can enable fabless semiconductor companies to fully leverage the features offered by its 14nm process technology to build innovative products. They should therefore be beneficial for Intel's Custom Foundry business, which should in turn drive up utilization rates and boost its results going forward.Currently, Intel holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Joy Global Inc (Symbol: JOY), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Synopsys Inc (Symbol: SNPS), the market cap is now $5.85B, versus Joy Global Inc (Symbol: JOY) at $5.76B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SNPS vs. JOY (Note that we have found 2 splits in the  ):Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, SNPS and JOY collectively make up 1.09% of the PowerShares Fundamental Pure Mid Growth Portfolio ETF (  ) which is higher by about 0.6% on the day Wednesday.At the closing bell, SNPS is down about 2.7%, while JOY is trading flat on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Synopsys Moves Up In Market Cap Rank, Passing Joy Global@2014-03-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-moves-market-cap-rank-passing-joy-global-2014-03-26

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe Synopsys' recent product launches and deal wins will boost results, going ahead. Moreover, the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by the company will likely drive its forthcoming results. Furthermore, the company provided encouraging guidance. The company has a good cash reserve that is necessary for funding further acquisitions.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys is likely to beat earnings this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 to surpass earnings estimates. However, that is not the case here due to the following factors: : ESP for Synopsys is 0.00% since the Most Accurate estimate stands at 35 cents per share, which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. : Synopsys' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ), with Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

he board of  (  ) has fixed the ownership stake of Carl Icahn and his associate entities to not more than 10.0% of the company's shares.This deal also covers shareholders other than Ichan, who would jointly hold more than 15.0% of Dell's outstanding shares.Some of Dell's shareholders have expressed their dissatisfaction with Michael Dell's offer, after which Ichan and investment firm  (  ) have raised the bid.Icahn already has a leading position among minority shareholders and could therefore make it difficult for Michael Dell to acquire the controlling stake.Moreover, this has been a major hurdle for Dell's board, who were more inclined toward Michael Dell and an investment group led by Silver Lake Partners to take the controlling stake.Icahn has announced that he has rejected Dell's offer of $25.0 million as expense reimbursements if he agreed not to attempt a hostile takeover.The latest decision regarding the stake came quickly, as Icahn Enterprises received an approval to terminate the normal waiting period -- i.e. within a period of 6 days -- which is generally needed before somebody can acquire a 25% ownership stake.Considering the latest developments, Dell's future remains uncertain. In the past year, the company has had its share of challenges, as cutthroat competition from  (  ) and  (  ), as well as a restricted spending environment hurt revenues.Moreover, privatization might help Dell move away from public scrutiny, but the decision regarding ownership is taking some time to settle.Dell Inc. has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

TravelSky provides IT solutions to the country's airlines, airports, air travel suppliers, travel agencies, individual and corporate travel consumers, and cargo services. Financial terms of the deal were not divulged.Per the deal terms, H-P will help TravelSky in developing a Passenger Services System (PSS), which will be known as ""New Compass"". A PSS helps airlines to manage their reservation system (i.e. selling of seats), flight details, seat availability and check-in process.H-P will provide the design for the PSS system and support TravelSky in the development and delivery of the 'New Compass"" to its clients located in 300 cities in China and 80 other cities worldwide. With the 'New Compass"" PSS system, the served airlines, airports and travel agencies can access flexible and scalable solutions for improved passenger experience.In a separate development, H-P announced a success story with Japan's largest airline, All Nippon Airways. The airline adopted H-P Autonomy's 'Optimost' marketing optimization software and 'TeamSite"" web-content management system. Leveraging H-P's services, the airline witnessed 30.0% growth in its online ticket sales. This has improved All Nippon Airways' annual revenues.A report published by International Air Transport Association shows a modest improvement in the financial performance of the industry in 2013, with solid contribution from the Asian-Pacific carriers. Specifically, these carriers are expected to record a profit of $4.2 billion in 2013, much more than $3.9 billion recorded in 2012.Considering the Asian airline industry growth, we believe H-P success as well as expertise in the field of aviation could prove beneficial for H-P's growth in the region.Though further indication of PC market slump in 2013, declining revenues and competition from  (  ) are concerns, back-to-back product launches, growing exposure into enterprise storage space and deal win momentum are encouraging.Currently, H-P has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

n Mar 29, 2013, Zacks  upgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).With a stellar second quarter 2013 performance, upcoming product launches, continuous deal wins and recent expansion in Australia, this provider of information technology (IT) and enterprise application solutions is an attractive investment opportunity. The stock's return was 267.8% in the past one year.Positive news flow continued for NetSol over the past few months, prompting the upgrade.In March, NetSol expanded its operations in Australia to make the most of the growing market opportunity in the broad equipment finance sector and improve service capability in the region.In February, NetSol reported solid second quarter 2013 results with earnings per share of 28 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 154.6% and the year- ago level by 366.7%. Revenues grew 37.2% year over year to $11.8 million. Revenue growth was supported by higher License and Maintenance revenues.Operating margin increased to 24.6% from 14.2% in the year-ago quarter, mainly due to tight expense control.For fiscal 2013, NetSol continues to expect total revenue in the range of $46.0-$49.0 million, with earnings per share between 80 cents and $1.00. The company also sees a strong product pipeline, order growth and improvements in Maintenance revenues for the second half of fiscal 2013.Apart from this, NetSol kept on winning deals. In the past few months, the company's NetSol Financial Suite (NFS) has been deployed by a Fortune 500 global equipment manufacturer, a European auto captive finance company, a Japanese auto captive finance company and Mercedes-Benz Finance Co., Ltd. Japan.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 increased 9.2% to 95 cents.In the past four quarters, the company has posted an average surprise of 52.6%.

n Apr 4, 2013, Zacks  downgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Dell has witnessed some downward estimate revisions after posting mediocre fourth-quarter 2013 results. The company had decided to go private to save itself from public and legal scrutiny which was affecting its profitability. Moreover, due to the impending recession in Europe, the company is not able to generate much business from that region.On Feb 20, 2013, Dell reported weak fourth-quarter results with revenues and margins taking a big hit. Revenues across the entire business declined over the past year.The major challenge at the moment is the cannibalization of its PC/notebook business. Moreover, the company is up against cutthroat competition from  (  ) and  (  ), as well as a restricted spending environment. The competition faced by the company in the SMB and server segments is also a concern.Moreover, Dell's Small & Medium Business (SMB) has not been doing so well in the last few quarters. This segment was down 5.0% in the fourth quarter, mainly attributed to the reduction in the order renewal rate by the SMB client as economic conditions have prompted conservative spending by customers, so they are either deferring their purchases or looking for cheaper alternatives.Although privatization might have helped Dell move away from public scrutiny, the go-shop period raised new problems for founder Michael Dell. It now appears that the privatization could be delayed because of the interest shown by other parties.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 decreased 5.7% to $1.65 per share over the last 60 days. For 2013, most of the estimates were lowered in the last 60 days, which pulled down the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.7% to $1.57 per share. Over the last 90 days, estimates for 2014 and 2015 dropped 6.4% and 1.8%, respectively.Dell operates in the IT industry and is a key player in the PC, server and mobile computing segment.Most of the computing stocks are placed as poorly as Dell.

 's (  ) Enterprise Services unit received two task orders from the U.S. Army Human Resources Command (AHRC) for an undisclosed sum. The task orders require H-P to continue providing information technology (IT) services to improve the agency's recruitment procedure and overall departmental operations in a cost-effective manner. The U.S. agency has been assigned the task of managing careers of potential army soldiers.Under the first task order, H-P will continue to manage IT infrastructure for AHRC with the help of its data center services for another three years. H-P has been providing this support since past 20 years. The data center service includes support for hardware (PCs, laptops and printers), networking, enterprise architecture and help desk. The new task order would also require H-P to extend its services for the U.S. Army Cadet Command and Army Recruiting Command, in addition to AHRC.Under the second task order, H-P will help AHRC in hiring/recruiting personnel through its Applications Services. With this service, AHRC can manage applications from prospective candidates and select suitable candidates for the job. The service also allows AHRC to simplify the process of online applications.Last week, H-P's Enterprise Services unit was chosen by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Department to provide call-center support for its U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ('USCIS') arm. The 5-year task order was valued at $220.5 million.Though deal wins under the Enterprise Services unit is pretty frequent, the segment's financial performances are not encouraging. In the recently concluded first quarter 2013, the segment registered a year over year revenue decline of 7.0%. But during the call, H-P mentioned that it will continue to focus on strategic enterprise services business, which includes cloud, application modernization, security and information management, and analytics. We find H-P's commentary encouraging and believe that the continuous deal wins will lead to better growth prospects for the segment.Though further indication of PC market slump in 2013, declining revenues and competition from  (  ) are concerns, back-to-back product launches and growing exposure into enterprise storage space are encouraging.Currently, H-P has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

 (  ) is reportedly selling its non-profitable inkjet business to Japan-based consumer electronics provider Funai Electric Co. for $100.0 million. The decision to divest its inkjet business is in line with Lexmark's restructuring plan announced in Aug 2012.As part of its restructuring initiatives, Lexmark planned to abandon its consumer-based inkjet hardware (printers) business, which failed to generate profits for the past few quarters. Instead, the company intended to focus more on the high-margin imaging and software solutions business.Further, Lexmark also announced plans to shut down its inkjet supplies manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines, by 2015, resulting in a headcount reduction of 1,700 employees. The exit from the Inkjet business is expected to save roughly $85.0 million of cash annually in 2013 and roughly $95.0 million annually by 2015. But the company will record a pre-tax severance charge of $30.0 million in 2013 and $10.0 million in 2014 and 2015 each.Per the contract, Funai will take over all the assets of inkjet business along with 1,500 inkjet patents, inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, the manufacturing facility in Philippines and inkjet-related technologies.Funai shares a longstanding business tie with Lexmark. Previously, Funai supplied hardware for Lexmark's inkjet printers. Hence, it will be easier for Funai to integrate the business within its operations. The quick integration will also help Lexmark's existing inkjet customers as they can get the services, software and supplies without any interruption.Having divested the inkjet business, Lexmark is now busy focusing on the software space through consecutive acquisitions. Since Jan 2013, Lexmark has acquired printing software solutions providers Twistage, AccessVia and Acuo Technologies, LLC. In 2012, Lexmark acquired Australia-based ISYS Search Software, which is a leading provider for search and text mining software; Boston-based Nolij Corp., which develops web-based document imaging and workflow software targeted toward the education sector and Luxembourg-based software company BDGB Enterprise, along with its U.S. subsidiary Brainware Inc. These acquired units became part of its Perceptive Software business.During the fourth quarter of 2012, Lexmark generated a solid 37.0% year-over-year growth within its Perceptive Software segment.Lexmark's fourth quarter results were not encouraging as its earnings per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a wide margin. Revenues came below the year-ago period but were better than expected due to improved performances in Perceptive Software and Managed Printing Services. Guidance for the first quarter was deterring, too, reflecting inkjet exit and macro uncertainty. But management looked confident with growth in software, which could offset the legacy headwinds.Currently, Lexmark has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other technology stocks that are performing well and are worth considering include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

n Mar 9, Zacks  upgraded  (  ) to Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Blackbaud has been witnessing rising earnings estimates on the back of strong fiscal fourth-quarter 2012 results and encouraging full-year 2013 outlook. Moreover, this well-known software solutions provider delivered positive earnings surprise in the last quarter with a surprise of 58.8%. The long-term expected earnings growth rate for this stock is 15.0%Blackbaudreported fiscal fourth-quarter (ended Dec 31, 2012) results on Feb 13, 2013. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 27 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and year-ago earnings of 17 cents by 58.8%.Each of the company's business units performed well during the quarter and the recent acquisition of Convio was accretive to the earnings with its Luminate product line. In addition, the company also gained through its go-to-market strategies.Earnings growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, were primarily driven by disciplined cost management and significant cost synergies from the Covio acquisition.Based on its progress, the company provided an encouraging guidance for full year 2013. For the full year 2013, Blackbaud expects total non-GAAP revenue in the range of $495 million to $505 million.Revenue guidance takes into account a negative impact of approximately $6 million related to incremental progress rationalizing and integrating the product suite and due to changing contractual terms with the company's product partner in the ticketing area, which requires it to move from gross to net revenue recognition for sales in the related solution. However, this adjustment will have no impact on the profitability.Non-GAAP operating margin is expected in the range of 19% to 19.5%, reflecting approximately 250 basis points growth from the prior year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 increased 8.6% to 88 cents per share as most of the estimates were revised higher over the last 30 days.The following software solution providers with favorable Zacks Rank are also performing well and are worth considering.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Blackbaud Upgraded to Strong Buy - Analyst Blog@2013-03-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/blackbaud-upgraded-to-strong-buy-analyst-blog-2013-03-11
"Shutterstock photoThere's nothing like a new CEO to whip a sagging business back into shape.Add to that rising product demand, and you've set the stage for a new growth phase. That's been the way things have played out for electronic design automation software vendorCadence Design Systems (  ).Cadence develops software used by semiconductor and electronic system customers to design integrated circuits and electronic devices. After losing money in 2008 and 2009 as the recession took its toll on the semiconductor industry and Cadence struggled with internal issues, the company began to rebound in 2010 and has been on a roll with hefty gains ever since.Key to its success have been the efforts of Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in early 2009. Tan, along with a new management team to support him, gave the company a good overhaul.Tan and his team revamped the company's business practices to focus on deal quality rather than short-term bookings and revenue, says analyst Richard Valera of Needham & Co. The strong adherence to deal quality, he says, set the foundation for much more predictable, sustained growth over the next several years.""Their execution on rebuilding the infrastructure of the company and its renewal pipeline, which had been depleted by the aggressive practices of prior management, has enabled Cadence to generate significantly above industry-average growth,"" he adds.That it has, and then some. Cadence has logged nine straight quarters of double-digit sales growth. Earnings have climbed by at least double digits in the same time.If followers are on target, Cadence should keep up its double-digit gains when it reports fourth-quarter results Wednesday after the close. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 12% to 19 cents a share. They forecast an 11% gain in revenue to $340.7 million.If analysts are right, that would represent a slowdown in its growth rate from the past several quarters. In the third quarter, earnings rose 50% to 21 cents a share, topping views. Revenue grew 16% to $338.5 million. It was the eighth straight quarter Cadence beat analysts' forecasts for both sales and earnings.Piper Jaffray analyst Gus Richard estimates Cadence will see 11% top-line growth in the fourth quarter vs. a year earlier and a 13% increase in earnings per share.""That's a little bit of a deceleration, but we'll see how it comes out,"" he said. ""They have consistently met expectations over the last eight or nine quarters. I don't expect that to change.""In addition to software, Cadence also offers emulation hardware that lets customers verify that the chip and software they're designing in conjunction with it are working prior to manufacturing the chip. This enables designers of chips for game consoles and other consumer electronics to speed their products to market using hardware simulators to run software on a ""virtual"" chip long before the actual chip exists.Valera says the market for emulation hardware began to surge in 2011. And Cadence, which is the leader in the emulation hardware market, benefited from this surge, which continued through 2012. Although the growth in its emulation hardware business was modest in 2012 relative to 2011, he adds, it's still been a good source of upside for Cadence throughout 2012, likely including the fourth quarter.While Cadence has enjoyed a steady string of quarterly ""beats,"" Valera says it will be difficult for Cadence to continue to exceed estimates to the same magnitude it has for the last couple of years.""Being four years into their recovery, we think some of the tail winds from normalization of their license model and renewal pipeline will be fading and that the magnitude of beats in revenue and earnings they've been delivering is likely to mitigate as we proceed into this year,"" he said.Cadence and its peers -- which includeSynopsys Inc. (  ), Mentor Graphics Corp . (  )and Magma Design Automation -- are benefiting from the trend toward smaller and more-complex chips for smartphones, tablets and other devices.""There's hardly any microprocessor or chip on the planet that will not have been touched by software from this company and its competitors,"" said Griffin Securities analyst Jay Vleeschhouwer. ""It's become impossible to design them without the use of these software tools.""As the complexity of chips has increased and their size has gotten smaller and smaller, he adds, it requires new types of software and an upgrading of tools to make them.""The shift to a post-PC era, new products and form factors are stimulating design activity,"" said Richard in a report.""Companies likeMicrosoft (  ),Google (  ), Apple (AAPL) and others are increasingly designing their own chips to take advantage of the shifting landscape and drive their ecosystems' growth.""Watchers expect Cadence's 2013 earnings to rise 49% to 76 cents a share. They see a 20% pop in 2014.""I think they'll continue to grind out operating margin improvements and low double-digit revenue growth in calendar 2013,"" said Richard. It's not a rocket ship. It's a slow grind higher.""The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Cadence Design Seen With Strong Profit, Sales Gains@2013-01-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cadence-design-seen-strong-profit-sales-gains-2013-01-25

"Shutterstock photoJust as architects use software to design buildings, so doesMentor Graphics (  ) help engineers design chips for the semiconductor industry.The Wilsonville, Ore.-based firm makes design automation software and hardware. Its products are used to conceptualize, design, emulate and test various electronic systems and components.Mentor is the oldest and third-largest company within the electronic design automation, or EDA, space. The other two players areSynopsys (  ) andCadence Design Systems (  ).""Typically, about three-fourths of the total industry's revenue is comprised of these three companies. And the remaining one-fourth is proportioned over many other smaller, mostly usually privately held companies,"" said software analyst Jay Vleeschhouwer at Griffin Securities.""Everything that we take for granted and have for many years . .. none of that could exist without the technology of these companies. It would be humanly impossible to get the degree of complexity and microscopic scale that we see in semiconductors and chips without the software tools that are used to create this,"" he said.Mentor's strategy is to focus on areas with the largest market share and the best capability, said Mentor's chairman and CEO Walden Rhines.""That's a little different from others who spread themselves more broadly. One of the reasons that we are doing well is that there's a whole new generation of semiconductor technology coming along and Mentor is the leading supplier of physical verification tools for integrated circuit design,"" Rhines said.The new generation is referred to as the 28/20 nanometer design, which is part of the constant move to smaller, deep sub-micron range of designs. With the device complexity and number of components increasing, the semiconductor industry's demand for power and capacity of design and verification tools is rapidly increasing.Mentor's flagship product is Calibre, which is a software used in the verification and analysis of chips.""Before you spend millions upon millions of dollars putting a new chip into production and then, sometime later, discovering that there may actually be something wrong with it, you don't want to get to that point without having tested and verified the chip design,"" said Vleeschhouwer.Mentor also does chip verification via hardware. Its latest product is Veloce 2, where you can emulate a prototype of a chip.""In years past, it was a fairly special-purpose kind of product, used only by certain kinds of chip designs. Now, in the last two years, it's ... used much more broadly by a wide range of people who do complex chip designs,"" said Rhines.""It's become the most cost-effective way for people to verify that their designs are, in fact, correct in doing what they are supposed to do,"" he added.The company expects the emulation portion of its business to grow 100% for the year.Mentor also has strong technology in the design of printed circuit boards, or PCB. These are the laminated boards that are populated with electronics that go into phones, tablets and computers.""Mentor is by far the market leader in that PCB category, which, even though it doesn't get a lot of attention from investors, happens to be part of the largest end-markets in EDA,"" Vleeschhouwer noted.Software comprises more than 90% of Mentor's business and three-quarters of that goes into designing chips, while the other quarter goes into designing systems.The latter is another fast, though at times bumpy, area of growth for Mentor. The systems include everything from printed circuit boards to automobiles to airplanes.""The systems business, surprisingly, is very rapidly growing because planes, trains and automobiles have traditionally been designed by more manual methods and they're in the process of automating their design processes,"" said Rhines.The cost of products usually ranges in the five- to six-digit numbers. About half of a booking is recognized as revenue when the company delivers the product.The remainder is either delivered as support over the life of the contract or as services that go along with the contract, explained Rhines.Some of Mentor's semiconductor customers are Toshiba, Freescale Semiconductor andIBM (  ) . Systems customers includeBoeing (  ), BMW, Airbus, Honda andGE (GE).The average life of a contract is three years and customer relationships tend to be long-standing.""They are extremely long relationships, the majority of our revenue comes from customers that we've been doing business with for decades and last year, our average three-year contract increased between 25% and 40% compared to the prior contract of the three years before,"" Rhines said.He estimates similar increases this year, with some quarterly variability.Often, customers will buy products from multiple vendors, and will assemble and mix and match various software. There is a relatively small pool of customers and within that set, an even smaller number of engineers who work on designing electronic products.""These companies, Mentor, Synopsys and Cadence, have increasingly overlapping product lines,"" said Vleeschhouwer. ""They increasingly either try to diversify or bulk up in areas where they are already strong.""Geographically, the fastest growth in the past decade has come from the non-Japan Asia, especially China, Korea, Taiwan and India. Mentor has the No. 1 market share in China and India, said Rhines.""A lot of the customers have put more and more engineering resources into India, and so the revenue follows where the engineering bodies are,"" said Vleeschhouwer.Also, structural and organic growth contributes to the region's growth.""In Korea, you've got customers like Samsung that are putting a ton of money into R&D and China is trying to build up its industry, so they'll have to consume and hopefully pay for software,"" he added.Europe, while it doesn't represent the largest region in terms of revenue, is a region where Mentor has the best market share.""It's a very esoteric industry. It's probably hard for most people to really get a feel for how a chip is designed. Everyone takes it for granted, you turn on your iPhone and that's it,"" said Vleeschhouwer. ""It's an extraordinary engineering accomplishment. If you think about the capabilities and the speed and the memory storage that gets packed into this extraordinarily small thing, that doesn't happen unless you have the right software tools.""The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Mentor Graphics' Software Helps Design Chips@2012-09-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mentor-graphics-software-helps-design-chips-2012-09-20
n Mar 20, 2013, Zacks  upgraded  (  ) or H-P to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).With a stellar return of 63.6% over the past three months, continuous deal wins and a positive estimate revision trend, this provider of computing solutions is an attractive investment opportunity.Positive news flow continued for H-P over the past few months, prompting the upgrade.In January, H-P managed to retain a federal contract worth $543.0 million despite  's (  ) protest. Earlier, a 5-year wireless tracking contract was announced by the Department of Veterans Affairs. H-P won the contract defeating 90 other competing companies. IBM challenged the agency's decision and its evaluation process before the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the agency to resolve contract disputes. The contract was held back for evaluation but was ultimately awarded to H-P.Since January, H-P sealed a number of deals. A Poland-based government healthcare unit, National Centre for Health Information Systems opted for H-P's services to develop the e-health environment (or electronic health record system) across Poland. The Department of Vermont Health Access renewed a service deal with H-P's Enterprise Services unit for 4 years. The tech giant also provided its services to automatic test equipment manufacturer Teradyne Inc., bellwether brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co., the U.S Immigration Agency and the U.S. Army Human Resources Command among others.H-P also unveiled a new BPO (business process outsourcing) solution, a host of desktop printers, two media players and a customized mobile application for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The new launches indicate the PC giant's focus shift from its low-margin PC-centric business.H-P recorded a 5.5% year-over-year decline in revenues and 11.8% decline in earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. But the highlights of the quarter were a modest guidance, share buyback and dividend payout. H-P was positive about the growth within its Storage and Networking segments. Also, the company mentioned that it would continue to focus on the strategic enterprise services business, which includes cloud, application modernization, security and information management, and analytics.Lastly, H-P's restructuring activities, which focus on reducing the cost structure and realigning the workforce to create investment capacity, support growth initiatives and innovation, which enable more effective operations globally, are also encouraging.In the last 60 days, 14 estimates were revised upward for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 each. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 increased 5.2% to $3.47, while the same for 2014 jumped 3.4% to $3.64.In the past four quarters, the company has posted an average surprise of 6.5%. Considering the above factors, H-P has the potential to post a positive earnings surprise in the upcoming quarter.Investors could also consider other technology stocks that are doing well right now. These include  (  ) and  (  ) both carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@H-P Upgraded to Strong Buy - Analyst Blog@2013-03-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/h-p-upgraded-to-strong-buy-analyst-blog-2013-03-26

" (  ) recently completed the acquisition of EVE. The acquired company is a provider of emulation platforms for SoC verification.The emulsion segment provides a range of technologies that are specifically used for verifying some of the complex systems on chips (SoCs) services. The acquisition enables the integration of Synopsys' technologies such as simulation, debug and verification IP (VIP) with EVE's technology. Eventually, Synopsys's customers can avail of wider verification solutions. This is a new line of business for the company, which it wants to explore.The company did not disclose the terms of the acquisition and does not expect it to contribute much to 2012 or 2013 results. Synopsys has for long been trying to tap this emulation technology and this is a nice opportunity for the company. EVE offers innovative emulation technology which is used by companies in semiconductor and electronic systems across the globe.Strategic acquisitions have always been on Synopsys' agenda to strengthen its product portfolio and promote growth. In August 2012, the company completed the acquisition of a privately-held electronic design automation (EDA) company, Ciranova.The company largely works on delivering productivity improvements in custom integrated circuit (""IC"") design. Again in January 2012, the company completed the acquisition of a privately-held software maker ExpertIO Inc.Acquisitions might be a prudent way of expanding the company inorganically. However, Synopsys needs to make bigger acquisitions to compensate for the modest growth rate in the industry. Also, the revenue contribution by the acquired companies remains uncertain as the industry is yet to pick up and generate additional business volume.Although Synopsys is gaining traction from new products and acquisitions, we believe these might take a quarter to produce favorable results. Besides, the company is also facing competition from  (  ).Synopsys currently has a Zacks #2 Rank (short-term Buy rating).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Synopsys Strengthens Emulation Biz - Analyst Blog@2012-10-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-strengthens-emulation-biz-analyst-blog-2012-10-05
 (  ) reported earnings per share (EPS) of 43 cents in the third quarter of 2012, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue in the third quarter stood at $443.7 million, up 14.7% from $386.8 million in the year-ago period. The company witnessed strong business growth and customers are interested to witness new design aggressively even amidst the prevailing uncertain economy.The average length of renewable customer license commitments was roughly 2.5 years in the quarter. (including time-based and upfront) were $388.2 million, up 13.8% from $341.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Upfront revenue was 5.7% of the total revenue and was well within the company's targeted range of less than 10.0%. were $55.5 million, up 21.7% from $45.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Gross profit in the third quarter was $344.0 million (77.5% of the total revenue), up 13.9% from $302.1 million (78.1% of revenues) in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin declined by 60 basis points, as the growth in cost of production slightly exceeded the growth in revenue.Total operating expense in the quarter was $280.6 million, up 15.1% from $243.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Research & Development (R&D), Sales & Marketing (S&M), General & Administrative (G&A) expenses also increased considerably in the quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 14.3% versus 15.0% in the year-ago quarter.GAAP net income in the reported quarter was $75.7 million or 50 cents per share, up from $52.1 million or 35 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding special items like amortization, acquisition-related costs, facility restructuring charge, facility restructuring charges, non-GAAP net income in the quarter was 43 cents per share compared with 47 cents in the year-ago quarter.Synopsys has a decent cash position. As of July 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents were $963.8 million compared with $796.6 million at the end of the previous quarter.For the fourth quarter of 2012, the company expects revenue to be in the range of $440 million - $448 million. GAAP expenses are expected to be in the range of $387.0 million - $403.0 million, whereas non-GAAP expenses are expected to be in the range of $345.0 million - $355.0 million.GAAP earnings per share are projected in the 22 cents to 28 cents range, while non-GAAP earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 46 cents - 48 cents.For fiscal 2012, revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.742 billion - $1.750 billion, while other income and expense are expected in the range of $1 - $3 million. GAAP earnings per share are expected around $1.25 - $1.31, while non-GAAP earnings per share are pegged in the range of $2.09 - $2.11.Synopsys delivered modest third quarter 2012 results, with revenue and operating performance remaining almost unchanged compared to the year-ago period. The improved performance was due to efficient cost management, which increased keeping pace with revenue.Moreover, with the increasing importance of the automation and IP industries; Synopsys is encouraged to enhance its process of innovations. Synopsys' financial strength, technology leadership and global support would drive the innovation process.The fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 guidance are encouraging. Although Synopsys is gaining traction from new products and acquisitions, we believe these will take some time to have meaningful impact on its result. In addition, we also believe that it will take some time for Synopsys to integrate the chip-design software provider SpringSoft, which will ultimately help the company to come up with innovative solutions.The company has a short-term Zacks #2 Rank (implying a Buy recommendation).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Synopsys Reports Modest 3Q - Analyst Blog@2012-08-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-reports-modest-3q-analyst-blog-2012-08-27
 's (  ) Taiwanese arm is now set to acquire chip-design software provider SpringSoft, which marks the fourth acquisition by the company year to date. Taiwan-based SpringSoft was established in 1996 to develop VLSI (Very-large-scale integration) chip design and debugging software.The acquisition, which is expected to be completed by Synopsys' first quarter 2013 earnings announcement, is valued at NT$12.2 billion, which translates into $406.0 million. The transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share.Synopsys develops software used to design, test and manufacture semiconductor chips. SpringSoft's offerings will therefore complement its existing capabilities, enhancing its existing suite of chip design solutions. The combined solutions will help its customers to better address complex design requirements, thereby creating room for more demand.Strategic acquisitions have always been Synopsys' plan to strengthen its product portfolio. In January 2012, the company acquired privately-held software maker ExpertIO Inc. Then, RSoft Design and Ciranova were acquired in May and July, respectively.One thing to note here is that Synopsys has shown no initiative to diversify to other lines of business, although its acquisitions have consistently boosted its core competencies. Additionally, taking over similar businesses enriches its portfolio, while reducing integration time and cost.Synopsys' healthy net cash balance and free cash flow position will allow smooth funding for further acquisitions.

" (  ) recently announced the completion of the acquisition of a privately-held electronic design automation (EDA) company, Ciranova. The company largely works on delivering productivity improvements in custom integrated circuit (""IC"") design. Specifically, Ciranova limits the time and effort needed to develop transistor-level layouts at advanced nodes.Synopsys intends to utilize Ciranova's technology, which to speed up enhancements in its custom IC solutions. The latter's technology will help the design teams to effectively meet the productivity challenges that arise as a result of complexities in nanometer design.Strategic acquisitions have always been Synopsys' plan to strengthen its product portfolio and it is helping the growth strategy. During 2011, the company made a number of acquisitions. In October, Synopsys completed the acquisition of privately-held electronic design Automation Company; Extreme DA. Again in January 2012, the company acquired privately-held software maker ExpertIO Inc.Integration of Extreme DA was easy, as it had the same line of business as that of Synopsys. Not only has Synopsys gained from Extreme DA's technology, but also from the utilization of its experienced human resources, particularly engineers and sales agents.Acquisitions might be a prudent way of expanding the company inorganically. However, Synopsys needs to make bigger acquisitions to compensate for the modest growth rate in the industry.Even if the company finds larger targets to acquire, we believe that funding could be an issue given the recent slowdown in the business, which has impacted results. This apart, the revenue contribution by the acquired companies remains uncertain, as the industry-yet to pick up and generate additional business volume .Synopsys' product innovation strategy, the popularity of its time-based license model and its strong cash position are positives. Although Synopsys is gaining traction from new products and acquisitions, we believe these might take a quarter to produce favorable results. Besides, the company is also facing competition from  (  ).Synopsys currently has a Zacks #2 Rank (short-term Buy rating).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Synopsys Closes Ciranova Acquisition - Analyst Blog@2012-08-03@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-closes-ciranova-acquisition-analyst-blog-2012-08-03
Although European and American debt issues are fundamentally different in cause and severity, could United States budget reform, or lack thereof, bring the country to the same crossroads as the European Union?Michael Sivy of  acknowledges that Europe’s troubles are the result of past debt, “some of which is now compounding at such high interest rates that for all practical purposes it can never be paid back. Call it a problem of arithmetic. The U.S., by contrast, is still years away from a debt crisis of the same magnitude. But it is having great difficulty getting its current budget under control. America’s problem, therefore, is not mathematical but political.”To be sure, the US national debt is significant, but in relation to economic output it is a far cry from disastrous levels. US debt is nearly 100% of GDP while, for example, Italy is at 120% of GDP, but roughly one third of US debt is owed to itself (from one sector of the government to another), so it “doesn’t really count.”Furthermore, Italy’s interest rate climbed above 7%, to the level of junk bonds, which increases Italy’s chance of default. Because investors are more confident in America’s ability to repay debts the US enjoys a relatively stable borrowing rate below 3%.So, what can America do wrong from here that could bring it to the same circumstances and fate as Europe? According to Sivy, our budget is out of control.One of the biggest budget issues to tackle, the biggest cause of long-term deficits, is the growth of entitlements, such as Social Security, which “is the easiest to stabilize.”“The real intractable problem continues to be healthcare, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Benefits and such. With rising medical costs and an aging population, it is hard to see what the solution would be, especially since recent health-care legislation has not slowed rising costs, and the prospect of reopening the health-care debate is hardly encouraging. Although we still have plenty of time to fix things, the political challenges look daunting indeed.”He adds that given the aging Baby Boomers and record life expectancy the US has about 10 to 12 years to figure out this problem before its debts reach Italian levels (under what the Congressional Budget Office calls the Alternative Fiscal Scenario.)Are you worried?High debt levels can harm the U.S. economy, and it can also do damage to your portfolio. Which is why we wanted to create a list of debt-free companies that you can use to start your own analysis.To create this list, we started with the 200 largest debt-free companies.

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its third quarter 2011 results on November 30, 2011, and we do not see any variation in analysts' estimates at this point.The company reported second quarter 2011 earnings per share (  ) of 39 cents, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents. However, revenue of $393.7 million grew 16.4% on a year-over-year basis.Revenue in the second quarter was $393.7 million, up 16.4% from $338.1 million reported in the year-ago period. The significant revenue growth was attributable to strong orders in the quarter and a faster business run rate. Moreover, the company benefited from the healthy electronics industry and higher demand for new products during the quarter.Gross profit in the second quarter was $307.6 million (78.1% of revenue), up 14.3% from $269.0 million (79.6% of revenue) in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in gross profit was attributable to the shift in product mix to high-margin products. The operating margin was 13.1% versus 13.3% reported in the year-ago period.GAAP net income in the reported quarter was $81.1 million or 53 cents per share compared with $39.5 million or 26 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Including special items like amortization, acquisition-related costs, facility restructuring charge and tax benefit from the IRS settlement, non-GAAP net income in the second quarter was $59.9 million or 39 cents per share compared with $52.3 million or 34 cents in the comparable quarter last year.For the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, the company expects revenues in the range of $378.0 - $386.0 million. Non-GAAP expenses are estimated to be in the range of $292.0 - $302.0 million. GAAP earnings per share are projected at between 25 cents and 31 cents and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 41 - 43 cents.For fiscal 2011, revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.52 billion, GAAP earnings per share to be between $1.33 and $1.46 and Non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.70 - $1.77. Cash flow from operations are expected to be approximately $300.0 million.The single analyst providing estimates for the October quarter left them unchanged over the last 30 days. Similarly, the two analysts providing estimates for fiscal year 2011 and 2012, kept their estimates unchanged over the last 30 days.We believe that Synopsys is slowly growing through acquisition. The company recently completed the acquisition of privately held electronic design automation (EDA) company, Extreme DA in the month of October. As both companies have the same line of business, the integration of Extreme DA will be easier for Synopsys.Not only will Synopsys gain from Extreme DA's technology, it will also gain from its people, particularly engineers and sales agents. The combined effort will aid Synopsys to deliver advanced solutions, helping customers to achieve scalability, convergence and throughput needs while designing ICs.The analysts do not foresee a meaningful change in the fundamentals of the company, so they have kept their estimates unchanged for the upcoming quarter and also for the fiscal years 2011 and 2012.Synopsys delivered decent second quarter results, although there was minimal improvement in operating performance. The third quarter 2011 guidance is encouraging.Although Synopsys is gaining traction from new products and acquisitions, we believe these will take some time to produce favorable results. The company is also facing competition from  (  ). We believe Synopsys' time-based licensing model has good visibility, and the company's cash position is decent.The company currently has a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Synopsys Inc. - Analyst Blog@2011-11-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-synopsys-inc.-analyst-blog-2011-11-25

This new IP technology is compliant with different speeds, different mobile device and is also capable of handling a broad range of high-speed interfaces for mobile applications.This DesignWare product has the capability of providing a multi-gear solution, and it also supports different interconnect protocols, which includes the JEDEC Universal Flash Storage (  ), the USB SuperSpeed Inter-Chip (SSIC), and the MIPI Alliance's Low Latency Interface (LLI), apart from the DigRF v4 and future CSI-3 and DSI-2 interfaces.Separately, the company has also devised a new IP solution in collaboration with Arteris, Inc., the inventor and leading supplier of network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect IP solutions. The collaboration led them to implement an MIPI Alliance Low Latency Interface (LLI) 1.0 specification, which would help mobile phones to deliver high performance with low power consumption in a compact silicon footprint, thus, helping the manufacturer to save on the phone memory cost.Apart from the introduction of these new products and strategic collaborations, the company is also focusing on acquisition for growth. Strategic acquisitions have always been Synopsys' ploy to strengthen its product portfolio. In 2011, the company made a number of acquisitions.In October, Synopsys completed the acquisition of privately-held electronic design automation (EDA) company, Extreme DA. The acquisition gives Synopsys access to the existing product portfolio along with gaining the customer base of the acquired company.Improved operating performance and cost-control steps enabled Synopsys to report an encouraging fourth quarter. The company also announced the acquisition of Magma Design Automation Inc., a chip design software manufacturer, which is expected to boost profitability. The first quarter 2011 guidance is also encouraging.Synopsys' product innovation strategy, the popularity of its time-based license model and its strong cash position make us optimistic about Synopsys.
