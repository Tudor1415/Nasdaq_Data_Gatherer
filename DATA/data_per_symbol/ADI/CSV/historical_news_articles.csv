However, in recent days, the stock has pulled back to around $100 per share.Even with the recent positive developments, the analyst community remains mixed on the company’s prospects.Some analysts, like  Craig Ellis, upgraded the stock and boosted their price targets. However, . The main concern is whether demand has truly improved. It’s possible recent strong results will cool once manufacturing normalizes.In other words, if manufacturing doesn’t see a V-shaped recovery, results could disappoint and send shares to lower levels.However, the stock has plenty of runway if results meet or beat expectations.  for this quarter’s earnings is around $1.39 per share. If the company can beat on earnings like it did last quarter, MCHP stock could move higher. In short, the recent pullback may be a strong buying opportunity.What’s also at play with Microchip Technology? Selling at a discount to peers, shares could move higher thanks to multiple expansion. Also, the company’s exposure to automotive technology “megatrends” is another solid reason to buy shares now.In a June 8 article, InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake included MCHP stock as  that could move higher.

"The ongoing advance in digital wireless technology, 5G, is bringing a sea-change to the way we connect in the virtual sphere. By now, we all know the advantages that 5G will bring: faster connection times, lower latency, and improved connectivity – especially in networked systems and Internet of Things. First introduced at the end of 2017, 5G is going to dominate the digital landscape. The current crises – health and economic – have only slowed it down slightly.The major US providers – Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint/T-Mobile – have all introduced 5G coverage, at least in the largest urban markets. It’s only a matter of time before the new systems are available uninterrupted coast-to-coast. The tech is expanding in Europe and Asia, too. China already has the world’s largest 5G networks, and Europe is working on cross-border networks.From an investor’s perspective, 5G is going to send successful providers and supply chain companies soaring. Investors have a rare opportunity here – there is a new technology in the offing, it has been around just long enough that we know it works, and it’s public knowledge where to find the companies involved. We’ve pulled up the  on three tech firms that are tied to 5G; here are the details.We’ll start with a chip maker. Silicon semiconductors are the heart and soul of modern electronics, and leaps in chip technology usually stand behind advanced in computing and networking. Analog is well known for its data conversion and signal processing chips.That know-how in processing chips is Analog’s entry into 5G. The company announced earlier this year that it is entering a partnership with Marvell, combing ADI’s wideband RF transceivers with Marvell’s 5G digital platform. The collaboration aims at optimizing solutions for 5G base stations, a key part of the new network’s hardware.Also in the news from ADI, related to 5G, is the company’s announcement in May that it is introducing a new millimeter wave solution. Access to the millimeter wave band is what makes 5G special; it allows the networks to improve performance. Analog’s advance in beamformer IC and up/down frequency conversion is step forward in using the radio frequencies.ADI showed a sequential earnings increase in Q2. While earnings are still down from Q4 2019, the $1.08 reported was up 4.8% from Q1 and beat the forecast by 2.8%.5-star analyst , writing form Oppenheimer, likes what he sees in ADI. He says, “Comms grew 15% Q/Q led by 5G RAN. Unsurprisingly, Auto was weak reflecting COVID-inspired OEM shutdowns… We applaud mgmt.’s proactive cost control efforts and continue to like ADI’s 5G-led structural growth story.”Schafer’s $140 price target on ADI shares implies an upside potential of 24% for the coming year, and supports his Buy rating. (To watch Schafer’s track record, )Overall, Analog has a Moderate Buy rating form the analyst consensus, reflecting some remaining caution from the grim Q1. Shares are selling for selling for $112.97, and the average price target of $122.83 suggests room for an 9% upside this year. ()Next up is Micron, a major name in the chip industry. Micron boasts a $53 billion market cap – and a leading position in the memory chip segment. Micron’s products are widely used in the gaming and data center markets, and its new DRAM chips will have a solid niche in 5G.In fact, just last month Micron revealed that its DRAM memory chips and its NAND long-term storage chips are already featuring in top-end Chinese-made 5G smartphones and will soon have a world-wide presence. The improved performance of the memory chips will make a strong compliment to the higher performance of the digital networks, giving users an all-around better experience.MU shares have rebounded from their heavy coronavirus hit in Q1 – the economic closures disrupted both supply chains and distribution networks – but are still trading at a discount relative to peers. This gives investors a chance to buy a top-notch stock before it pops.""Micron is confident 5G will lead to a return to smartphone unit growth in 2021 and over the next few years,"" says 5-star JPMorgan analyst  following an investor meeting with management. ""Micron is well-positioned to drive dollar content higher in the 5G era in both DRAM and NAND,"" the analyst added.Looking at the bigger picture, the analyst noted, ""We continue to expect relatively strong data center demand to continue into the back half of the year as drivers of strong demand from work-from-home, e-commerce, gaming, etc., that are likely to persist.""Sur rates Micron stock a Buy and backs that with a $65 price target, implying room for an impressive 39% upside this year. (To watch Sur’s track record, )MU’s Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating is based on a mix of reviews, 26 in all, including 19 Buys along with 6 Holds and 1 Sell. The stock is priced at $47.91, and the average price target, $63.78, indicates a 37% upside potential. ()Last on today’s list is Keysight, a player in the lab equipment segment. Lab equipment? Yes, because every chip that goes out in a 5G product – especially the newly designed models – must be rigorously tested. Keysight produces the in-circuit testers, multimeters, oscilloscopes, and signal generators necessary for lab certification of silicon semiconductor chips.Keysight was the first test equipment provider to enter the 5G market, and holds a leading position. The company works closely with 5G manufacturers and providers, and offers a variety of 5G wireless test platforms. As the new networks ramp up, Keysight will only see a growing demand for these services.And this is what makes Keysight special, for an investor. The strength of its niche can be seen in the share performance: KEYS is the only stock on this list which has outperformed the markets during the current bear cycle. KEYS is up $10 since the February market slide.Credit Suisse’s 5-star analyst  paints a powerful case for KEYS in his ‘blue sky scenario:’ “Note that during both 3G and 4G transitions there were periods when the Company grew more than 10% y/y - as 5 G starts to become bigger investors will start to believe in growth. Assuming increased defense spending, 5G adoption and further broad-based demand across its segment we see the multiples expanding…”Pitzer’s $125 price target implies a healthy 17% upside, and justifies his Buy rating. (To watch Pitzer’s track record, )The stock’s recent gains have pushed it right up against the $110.57 average price target, so the upside is only 2.2%, but as Pitzer shows above, there may be more room than that available for share appreciation here. KEYS has a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 6 Buys and 3 Holds set in recent weeks.

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 5/28/20, Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), SBA Communications Corp  (Symbol: SBAC), and Badger Meter Inc (Symbol: BMI) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.  Analog Devices Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.62 on 6/9/20, SBA Communications Corp  will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.465 on 6/18/20, and Badger Meter Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.17 on 6/12/20.  

As a percentage of ADI's recent stock price of $114.36, this dividend works out to approximately 0.54%, so look for shares of Analog Devices Inc to trade 0.54% lower — all else being equal — when ADI shares open for trading on 5/28/20.  Similarly, investors should look for SBAC to open 0.16% lower in price and for BMI to open 0.27% lower, all else being equal.



When an S&P 1500 component reaches 20 years of dividend increases, it becomes a contender to join the elite ""Dividend Aristocrats"" index.  Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is a "","" with 17+ years of increases.

"  has made a nice recovery since the March crash on the back of a turnaround in the broader stock market, but the chipmaker's comeback isn't backed by a robust financial performance.The company had to  in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak that spawned uncertainty with respect to demand and disrupted supply chains. The novel coronavirus pandemic compounded Analog Devices' problems as the company was already witnessing  in the semiconductor business. data by And now, the company's latest quarterly results and the accompanying guidance provide further evidence that a turnaround in its fortunes is still some way off. There are quite a few pointers why Analog Devices may be a risky bet . Let's take a look.Image Source: Getty Images.Analog Devices' second-quarter revenue fell 14% year over year to $1.32 billion, while earnings fell to $1.08 per share from $1.36 per share in the prior-year period. The results were mixed from Wall Street's perspective as analysts were looking for $1.04 per share in earnings on $1.33 billion in revenue.But investors shouldn't forget that Analog was originally expecting $1.35 billion in revenue before it pulled its guidance on account of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The company's margins also took a hit during the quarter. Adjusted gross margin fell 290 basis points, while the adjusted operating margin was down by 350 basis points over the year-ago quarter.The third-quarter guidance isn't very promising, either. Analog forecasts $1.32 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, down from the prior-year period's earnings of $1.26 per share and revenue of $1.48 billion.As it turns out, Analog Devices is facing challenges across its different business segments. The company's automotive and communications businesses, which together account for 35% of the total revenue, were down 23% and 24% year over year, respectively.Management points out that weak vehicle sales and suspension of manufacturing operations dented the automotive business last quarter, which isn't surprising as several automakers halted production to contain COVID-19. The bad news for Analog Devices on this front is that auto sales in 2020 are expected to decline 22%, according to IHS Markit.Similarly, there are reports that the deployment of 5G networks may be delayed, creating a headwind for Analog Devices' communications business. CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah admitted on the latest  that its communications business ""is and will remain lumpy"" in the near term, though the deployment of 5G will lead to long-term recovery.And finally, Analog Devices says that its industrial business -- accounting for 54% of the total revenue -- is facing weakness across the board, barring some pockets such as the healthcare vertical.In all, Analog Devices' financial performance may not improve substantially in the near term thanks to the headwinds created by COVID-19.Management believes that Analog Devices will be able to withstand the short-term challenges thanks to its balance sheet and cash flow profile. The company finished the quarter with $800 million in cash and $5.6 billion of debt. It retired $300 million worth of debt during the quarter, but also put its share repurchase plan on a temporary hold as a precautionary measure.Analog Devices says that it has $2 billion worth of liquidity (including a revolving credit facility) that should help it meet its dividend commitment this year and the debt maturing in January 2021. That's good news for investors, as several companies have either suspended or reduced their payouts to preserve cash.Analog Devices sports a nice dividend yield of 2.33%, which may attract income-oriented investors since it has managed to sustain its payout during these uncertain times. But then, the company's payout ratio of 66% isn't what one would call conservative, especially considering that its cash flow and margins have been heading south over the past year. data by Additionally, Analog stock isn't cheap right now. Its price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 33 is higher than the five-year-average multiple of 30. It may not be a good idea to go long Analog Devices at this valuation given the ongoing weakness in the business as well as the headwinds expected in the coming months. So, anyone looking to buy  should look at  as Analog doesn't appear to be a solid bet right now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Dividend Stock Doesn't Look Like an Attractive Bet Right Now@2020-05-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-dividend-stock-doesnt-look-like-an-attractive-bet-right-now-2020-05-28

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"I wanted to find five cheap stocks that have huge price appreciation potential. For these stocks, the valuations are well below their peers.Here, the market is failing to recognize the growth potential of these cheap stocks. In effect, they are value stocks that should be growth stocks. The patient investor — who can withstand temporary dips –will do quite well with these investments.For example, the average price-earnings ratio of this group of cheap stocks is just 17 times earnings. But their peers have much higher P/E ratios. In addition, the same is true of their enterprise value-revenue valuations.The potential upside of each of these stocks is 30% to 50%, as a minimum, based on my target price for each one.Here are the names of this selective group of cheap stocks stocks:Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$27.7 billion19.2x54.9%The first company on my list of cheap stocks is Microchip Technology. It is a large semiconductor product designer and manufacturer based in the U.S. The company makes advanced microcontrollers and microprocessors, as well as memory and flash DRAM products.Its earnings have waned as a result of the novel coronavirus, which has lowered demand. However, now that global restrictions are being lifted, the company expects a significant pickup in orders worldwide.Moreover, its move into selling products for data centers as well as curtailing manufacturing to line up with demand should increase profits.Three of its peers have significantly higher valuations, despite similar industry conditions. Therefore, I suspect the company is worth significantly more than its present price.For example, right now Microchip Technology trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.1 times. This is well below its peers such as  (NASDAQ:), with its forward P/E ratio of 28.6 times. In addition,  (NASDAQ:) has a forward ratio of 27.1 times, and  (NASDAQ:) has a 50.5 times ratio.Using these peer ratios with Microchip Technology’s March 2021 expected earnings of $5.73 per share gives MCHP stock a target price of $170.43. This represents 54.9% upside for investors in the stock.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$13.1 billion17.2x218.4%GoDaddy is a U.S. domain registrar and web hosting company. It is a very profitable company with over a 23% return on equity in 2019.GoDaddy’s domain bookings and average revenue per user (ARPU) have been growing nicely over the past several years. Moreover, its free cash flow is very strong. Last year, it was over $635 million, and for the last 12 months to March 31, FCF rose to $685 million.Based on the GDDY stock $13.1 billion market value, the FCF yield is very high at over 5%.I like this stock for one simple reason. It is an arbitrage play on the valuations of some of its peers. For example, GDDY stock has a forward P/E of just 17.2 times expected earnings. But some of its peers have massively higher valuations.For example,  (NASDAQ:) has a forward P/E of 215.5 times.  (NYSE:) is at 186 times and  (NYSE:) is at 229 times.The average of these three forward P/E ratios is 210.2 times. I decided to discount these by 75%. The target P/E in my valuation is roughly 54.6 times.Even with that significantly lower P/E valuation, my target price for GDDY stock is $250. That implies potential upside of over 218% from its present price.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$11.7 billion14.1x57.8%OpenText is a Canadian software company that specializes in enterprise information management (EIM) applications. The company , which performs online backup for personal computers.The company is a serial acquirer of “bolt-on” companies in its space. Recently, it decided to institute a restructuring plan, which may reduce its operating profits in the short term.Nevertheless, its free cash flow in the last 12 months was very respectable. The company generated $904.1 million in cash flow from operations and spent just $68.4 million.That means it generated $835.7 million in FCF. Given its $11.7 billion market value, its FCF yield is very attractive at over 7%Using the same peer valuation method I used in the other stocks above, the average P/E ratio for OTEX stock should be 44.5 times earnings. However, the stock trades for just 14 times its forward earnings.Using a 50% discount factor, I set the price target at 22 times earnings. This means the stock is worth at least $68.06 per share. That represents a very respectable potential upside of 58% for OTEX stock.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
	$2.7 billion18.5x64.3%Cornerstone OnDemand is a California-based talent management and experience software provider. It helps companies with their recruiting, employee learning and performance management functions. The company is extremely profitable.For example, in the last 12 months ending March, it generated $114.2 million in CFFO. FCF in the last 12 months was $99.4 million. Moreover, some of the companies in this employment industry space are highly valued.Based on the relative P/E valuations of some of its peers, the company should be trading at a forward P/E multiple of over 60 times. However, CSOD stock trades for just 18.5 times its forward expected earnings for the year ending December 2021.I applied a 50% discount figure to that and derived a target price of $68.54 per share. This helps provide a margin of safety for the stock valuation. It also takes into account other factors. For example, this discount accounts for the fact that some of its higher-valued peers do not make money in employee software like Cornerstone.Nevertheless, this price target represents a potential gain of over 64% for investors in CSOD stock.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA
$77.7 million17.5x43.2%AudioEye is a software company that provides web accessibility software for existing corporate internet sites. For example, it helps blind people hear a reading of each page they search. Its software allows for a larger print of words on a site so people will have a clearer vision of the contents. Some people are color blind, so AudioEye’s software helps make some functions clearer to them.The company’s sales have been growing consistently over the past several years. Corporations allow AudioEye to modify software code on their sites, such that anyone who needs better accessibility can use it. Moreover, a number of legal cases requiring Americans with Disabilities Act compliance have propelled further sales.I have been following the company for a while. Here is why I think the AEYE stock is now worth looking at. Recently management indicated in its March earnings press release that .Moreover, the company produces consistent and recurring revenues. In fact, AudioEye regularly gives guidance on its monthly recurring revenues (MRR). Even more importantly, AudioEye is at the inflection point where operating leverage provides huge profit growth. Marginal increases in revenue, after variable expenses, go straight to profits as its overhead is covered by existing cash flow.Based on this, I estimate that earnings for the year ending 2021 will be at least 50 cents per share, if not higher.That puts AEYE stock on a forward P/E of just 19 times. For a company with this type of fast-growing revenue and recurring earnings, I deem it is worth at least 25 times earnings for 2021. That gives the stock a target price of $12.50 and an upside of at least 43%.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA holds a position in one of the aforementioned securities, AudioEye (AEYE).

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2020 , Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter 2020 [Phonetic] , which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. -- Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com.Now onto the disclosures; information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the uncertainty regarding the duration of COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on our business, our customers and suppliers and the global economy, and also those discussed in earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? -- Thank you, Mike and good morning to you all from Boston. I hope that you and your families are all staying safe and healthy during this period. First, we want to express our gratitude to the healthcare workers and the many other heroes on the front-lines who protecting the health and the well-being of our communities. Thank you all so very, very much. When we had our last  in mid-February, we were just beginning to understand the depth of the COVID-19 impact in China, and since then the pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, putting tremendous stress on society and of course, the global economy. To counterbalance this, we've seen an unprecedented response from governments, with the deployment of fiscal and monetary policies to soften the downturn and restart economic activity, whenever that may be.While our sector is not immune to the turbulent operating environment, it's my belief that technology will be what modifies the current weakness and drives new demand and business models post pandemic. That's not to say that we're standing still, we've taken actions to curtail spending and reinforce our cash position, and we are learning from this challenging period and deducting quickly, while still investing to ensure that we are well positioned in the recovery and for the long term.Our team has embraced the challenges, with many of our employees working from home. But obviously, not everyone can work remotely, and I want to acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees, who have continued to perform at exceptional levels and deliver for our customers. For these employees supporting our critical operations, we've implemented safeguards to protect them, including more PPE, increasing social distancing, and enhanced sanitization, and we've provided them with additional incentives and benefits to allow for continuity during this very difficult time.Our team has also done an excellent job staying close to our customers. We moved quickly to pivot manufacturing lines and prioritize our healthcare solutions that are needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has allowed us to expedite supply used in products, such as ventilators, respirators, imaging systems and patient monitors to our healthcare customers and I'm incredibly proud of the resourcefulness and commitment that we've shown in rising to this critical challenge.Additionally, through the ADI Foundation, we've made multimillion dollar donations to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. But our work goes beyond financial contributions. We're also partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions, such as, rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical grade patient monitoring, that leverage our technologies.So now I'd like to discuss the current operating environment a bit. Given the reach and depth of the current crisis, global business activity has been disrupted and to-date, we have seen a deterioration in demand within our Automotive, broad based industrial and consumer businesses. However, our business is proving more resilient than during the global financial crisis. To that end, healthcare demand is at record levels and communications demand is robust across wireless and indeed, wireline sectors. We are also seeing strength in portions of our industrial instrumentation business and steadiness in our defense business.Now this success is no accident. Through our organic investments and acquisitions of Hittite and LTC, ADI is a very different company than we were a decade ago, with more diversity, a broader portfolio across high-performance Analog, Power and RF, and higher exposure to more profitable and durable end markets.So now let me move to the other side of the equation, and talk a little bit about supply. Across the world, supply chains were disrupted, when many governments ordered shelter in-place mandates and closed their borders. For ADI, capacity was reduced at our back-end tests and assembly sites in mid-March across the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Once granted essential status, we acted quickly yet responsibly, to ensure employee safety and improve our capacity. And today, I'm glad to say we're operating at normal capacity levels. This demonstrates the agility of our global operations and the dedication of ADI's employees around the world. Despite the fluid and uncertain demand and supply environment, we delivered revenue of $1.32 billion and EPS of $1.08. This was in line with the original range we provided on our first quarter , underscoring the resiliency and flexibility of our business model in any economic backdrop.Now, as we mobilize to preserve ADI strength in the near term, we're capitalizing on the many opportunities we see to fortify and expand our market position for the long term. Our team remains focused on our three strategic priorities, so let me provide you with a brief update on each. First is the efficient use of capital. Importantly, ADI has ample financial liquidity to meet the needs of our business across critical investments, dividend payments and servicing our debt. Despite the current macro environment, we've generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 32% of sales over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500.Throughout our 55-year history, we've encountered and navigated several black swan events successfully, by taking a disciplined and balanced approach to financial management. Specifically, the first call on our capital is funding new product development. This means investing smartly in both our people and technologies, to ensure we continue to deliver disruptive innovation. In the quarter just passed, we invested 19% of revenue in R&D, spending 95% on the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets.We also remain committed to strong shareholder returns, with our dividend as the cornerstone. In the quarter, we returned over $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.So let me turn to our second priority, which is about maximizing customer impact. We are continuously innovating to stay ahead of customer needs, and while COVID-19 has brought new challenges, it has also reveal new opportunities in a reordered world. During the quarter, our customer engagement didn't slow down. We hosted hundreds of virtual seminars, with thousands of customers in attendance, training them on new solutions and new technologies. These interactions were very productive. We saw increased design activity on new product development across markets and customers. For example, we partnered with a key electric vehicle customer to reimagine how audio is rendered across their fleet. As a result of this increased and focused collaboration, we added our high performance audio digital signal processors to our A2B platform, more than doubling our content per vehicle.And then our instrumentation test business for datacenter compute, we continue to work with customers on reducing their system complexity and getting to market faster. Our innovative solutions combine our analog-mixed-signal and power micro module portfolios. These solutions deliver four times the channel density, while simultaneously increasing throughput. While these are just two examples, there are many more across all of our markets, it's this current flurry of design activity that positions ADI to accelerate post pandemic.Our third priority is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. While every downturn has its own unique characteristics, they all seem to have one thing in common, that is they drive tremendous change. Industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever, and new industries or emerging, focused on the physical and cyber. ADI, where the data is born, is at the center of these exciting secular growth opportunities, and I wanted to share some thoughts with you today.As I noted earlier, our healthcare business is providing several of the technologies that are critical to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Taking a step back, ADI has been committed to this market for many years, as we anticipated, the opportunity for innovation to deliver better patient outcomes. Now this crisis will challenge us to rethink and hopefully fast track the accessibility, affordability and wellness focus of global healthcare. To achieve this, healthcare systems are going to need to be upgraded and clinical grade patient monitoring will need to be extended from the hospital, right down to the patient's home. Massive adoption of sensing, computing and cloud capabilities is going to be required, and we believe that ADI's technologies will be at the forefront of this transformation.The communications market is moving at a rapid pace to keep up with the strains put on bandwidth and latency, as more people work remotely, transact business more digitally, and consume media from everywhere. Here ADI is playing a critical role in building out the infrastructure required for an always connected world. Our integrated transceiver, power and optical control portfolios are enabling customers to economically scale their investments to build the next generation networks. We continue to innovate to meet future performance, size and power needs, positioning us to gain share and to capture additional value.Another secular trend we're benefiting from, is the rise of Industry 4.0. Now while this trend isn't so new, the pandemic is moving it to the forefront of our customers' minds. It's clear that post pandemic, supply chains will be reimagined and new ones will be built, ones that are more flexible, automated and perhaps sovereign. To solve the economic burden that comes with this, customers will further automate their businesses with Intelligent and Connected Factory floors and the increased use of robots, cobots and analytics. This creates additional demand for our precision signal chain of power franchises and extends ADI into new areas like software I/O, depth sensing, condition based monitoring, and robust connectivity.Outside of these secular growth trends, I'm also personally inspired by the tremendous sustainability benefits that we've seen in a short amount of time. For example, we've seen sizable decreases in carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide. I believe that ADI and the industry at large can and should be leveraging its creative brainpower to be better stewards of the planet. We recently published our comprehensive Corporate Responsibility Report entitled Engineering Good, and I can assure you, there will be more to come as I am deeply committed to ADI's leadership here.So in closing, the shape of the economic recovery is still very-very uncertain and dependent on many variables. While we're confident in our outlook provided today, this unprecedented macro backdrop will continue to influence supply and demand dynamics for some time to come. We're embracing these short term challenges and by leveraging the collective power of our talent, our technology and customer engagements, I'm very confident we will emerge stronger.So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Prashanth. -- Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter . As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release.Back in March, we withdrew our guidance for the second quarter, as the spread of COVID created an enormous amount of uncertainty and impacted our supply chain. However we acted quickly and decisively and I'm pleased to say that our second quarter results were within our original guidance, with revenue of $1.32 billion, operating margin of 38% and EPS of $1.08. Without those capacity limitations, we believe revenue would have been above our original midpoint provided at our first quarter earnings, or approximately $50 million higher.So let's get into the market results. Our B2B markets, while very volatile intra-quarter due to COVID-19, performed relatively in line with our expectations. B2B revenue increased 3% sequentially and if not for supply constraints, we would have delivered on our outlook of growing mid to high single digit sequentially. Notably, we achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by $60 million in the quarter. Industrial, which represented 54% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 4% sequentially and declined 8% year-over-year. While we experienced broad-based weakness across most applications, our healthcare, memory test and energy verticals all grew from the year ago period.Communications, which accounted for 21% of revenue, finished up 15% sequentially and given the tough compare decreased 24% year-over-year with weakness across both wireless and wired. This market is and will remain lumpy, but over the long term, will be a high growth market for ADI, given our positioning in 5G and optical control systems.Automotive, which represented 14% of revenue, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year with declines across all major applications. Not surprisingly our auto business was impacted by lower vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production, as many customers were required to suspend their operations in response to COVID-19. Lastly, consumer which represented 11% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, as lower consumer spending impacted both portables and prosumer. Notably, we continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment.Let's go to the P&L for the second quarter; gross margin came in at 67.7%, down both sequentially and year-over-year related to low utilizations from reduced production levels and the factory closures I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we expect to realize $100 million of cost of goods savings exiting fiscal 2021, through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. Opex was $390 million, down 5% sequentially, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of declines. This was driven by a combination of the quick aggressive measures we took in response to pandemic, as well as our continued focus on cost management.Operating margin finished at 38%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and down year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $49 million, up sequentially but down over $10 million compared to last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11% and all told, second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $1.08.So now let's go to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we proactively bolstered our strong liquidity position. We retired a $300 million bond and subsequently raised $400 million from the semiconductor industry's first ever Green Bond, and as a cautionary measure, we also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway through the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and about 5.6 in total debt. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.9 times on a trailing 12 month basis. Between cash on our balance sheet and the commitments under our revolving credit facility, ADI has more than $2 billion of liquid liquidity, easily eclipsing our annual dividend payment and the debt due in January of 2021.Inventory was essentially flat from the first quarter. However, days of inventory fell to 126 from 133. Our sell-in revenue was well below our sell through revenue at distributors. As I mentioned, we reduced channel inventory by about $60 million in the second quarter. This brings our total channel reduction to around $100 million in the first half of fiscal 2020. Channel inventory currently sits comfortably at the low end of our seven to eight week range.So finishing on cash flow for the quarter, cash flow from ops was $429 million and capex was $60 million. We expect capex to decline meaningfully in the second half and finish the year below our normal target range of 4% of revenue. In the quarter, ADI paid approximately $230 million in dividends and repurchased $114 million of our stock. On a trailing 12 month basis, free cash flow finished at $1.8 billion or 32% of revenue. Over this period. we reduced debt by roughly $400 million and returned around $830 million to shareholders via dividends and an additional $500 million via repurchases.As a reminder, our capital return policy is to return all free cash flow after debt reduction to shareholders. In fiscal 2020, we expect to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million, and return 100% of the remaining free cash flow.Before moving to our outlook, I want to highlight what we are seeing in terms of demand and supply. As Vince mentioned earlier, our business is performing quite well under the current macro backdrop. Healthcare is very strong, and we expect this strength to persist into the back half of the year. We are seeing robust demand in communications across both wireless from 5G deployments and wireline from data center and networking upgrades. This strength is benefiting our industrial instrumentation business, where we sell high performance solutions used in both memory and 5G testing. And lastly, defense is typically a steady business against all economic backdrops. All told, these markets represent almost half of ADI's revenue over the last year.From a supply standpoint, we enter our fiscal third quarter at normal capacity levels. This is quite remarkable and I want to echo Vince's appreciation for the dedicated manufacturing teams across the world.And that brings us to our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially at $1.32 billion plus or minus $70 million, which is a wider range than usual to account for the uncertain environment. This outlook includes approximately $50 million of revenue that was pushed from second quarter, due to capacity constraints. We are assuming no change in channel inventory in this plan. We anticipate robust sequential growth in comps, modest sequential declines in industrial and consumer, and a sharp sequential decline in automotive. All told, B2B should increase slightly sequentially and decline just under 10% year-over-year. We anticipate op margins to be approximately 38.3% plus or minus 150 bps. We're planning for the tax rate in the quarter to be between 12% and 13%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be a $1.08 plus or minus $0.11.As Vince said, we are confident in our third quarter outlook, but we are mindful of the tremendous uncertainty around us. Our operating model is to plan conservatively and execute aggressively to preserve free cash flow in the near term. At the same time, we remain focused on the long term, continuing to invest to capture and create value across several exciting secular growth areas.Let me pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A. -- Okay. Thank you, Prashanth. Now let's get through our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we'll give you an opportunity for follow-up questions. Cheryl, can we have our first question please?Thank you. Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Yeah, good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the solid results, given the back backdrop. Vince, I guess the question I'm getting this morning from investors is, just relative to your July quarter guidance, most of your peers have been guiding anywhere from 10 to 15 percentage points below seasonal, you guys are guiding about 5 percentage points below seasonal. And I guess the question that's being asked is, to what extent are you just not being as conservative as your peers, to what extent are there some idiosyncratic drivers. Could you help us parse that out? -- Yeah thanks, John. So I think first and foremost, we've seen tremendous strength in our healthcare business over the last quarter and we expect that will also continue. Also generally speaking, you know with virtualized commerce, work from home, we're seeing again very-very strong demand for the communications products. The Optical Cable portfolios of ADI are doing particularly well and of course 5G, especially in China and Asia, the 5G buildout is moving at pace. So what we're seeing -- what we are predicting, looking ahead is based on the order streams that we've seen, and whatever -- but what others are predicting, we feel comfortable based on the strike in the areas I have just mentioned. Our defense business continues quite strong. Also business is attached to, let's say the build out of datacenters and flow like advanced instrumentation test systems for memory, storage and so on so forth, are also doing particularly well. So the overall industrial business holds in there, as Prashanth said, probably see a modest decline, a seasonal decline in the third quarter. So overall, they are the drivers and as Prashant said, we expect a steep decline in the automotive business, but when you look at the puts and takes, that's how we see the quarter shaping up. -- And just maybe... -- That's helpful. Go ahead, I am sorry Prashanth. -- I was going to give a little bit more background on kind of the orders and outlook, which may help investors as to why our guide came in where it is. So very quickly kind of, as expected, Feb was weak, March came back very strong, largely driven by China, but also some pretty strong demand outside from customer concerns, and then it began to correct. So April was soft, continued into May. We finished with kind of book-to-bill above 1.0 in all of our markets, except auto. So as we thought about the outlook, we -- we built our outlook on the expectation, that orders are going to continue to slow through the quarter or best case, stabilize. The guide that we have out there is build on a 100% backlog coverage, which is much higher than we would normally use when we are at this point in the quarter. We're working terms with our customers and we are enforcing them pretty stringently, so any customers or DISTI [Phonetic] orders are non-cancellable within a 35-day window, unless we agree to grant an exception. So that's helping to kind of clean through the backlog and limit order cancellations.So, all in, I think the assumptions are reasonable, given the amount of uncertainty and we did put a little bit wider range on there, plus or minus 70, to reflect the uncertainty. -- Do you have a follow-up John? -- That's great color guys. And then just as my follow-up, as you mentioned in your prepared comments, the concept of Industry 4.0 has been around for a while, but it does seem like COVID has the potential of actually shining a spotlight on that, in a way that we haven't. And I guess in my mind, that probably also helps the 5G buildout, because it's hard to have an intelligent factory floor without that 5G backbone. But I was hoping maybe you could help us define that market opportunity for you? When you look at sort of the intelligent factory floor, what percent of your industrial business is it today, and how should we think about potential growth rate, three to five years out, if this really starts to accelerate? -- Yeah, it's, it's a good question, John, I would say today, what we would consider to be industry 4.0 with a highly cloud connected industrial sector, is quite small. I think today it's probably less than 10% of the total installations of factory automation and process control systems. But the intelligence we're getting from many of our customers now is that, there are two things driving the need for the deployment of industrial -- probably three things, one, the need for them to understand how to gather and utilize data analytics to improve the outcomes for their customers. So that as soon as automatically that you deploy 5G, you deploy optical connectivity, many forms of shorter robust connectivity. I think also the -- in overseeing the fragility of the supply chain globally, and customers are telling us, they're expecting to bring more machine capability into managing the supply chain. And I think thirdly is the the regionalization or this optimization [Phonetic] of supply chains and we can see the pressures there globally. and not to mention the demographics, many of the societies that are producing lots of capital goods and consumer good outputs, like Germany, China and as America begins to regionalize supply chain, we're likely to see the adoption of cobotics and more robotics technologies in general. So I think there is a long way to go John, we're in the early innings of the industrial 4.0, the adoption of that. -- Thanks John, can we go to the next question please?Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Good morning, Terry. -- Thank you and congratulations on the results. First question is for Vince. Vince, you talked quite a bit about sort of investing in this time frame and you highlighted again, medical and industrial. What about the automotive market, are you seeing sort of a secular change there? Are you still investing or will you still be investing as heavily in automotive going forward? -- Well, we've actually been ramping Tore our investments in automotive, particularly in the infotainment, the power side of things and also the electrification of the vehicle, the electric powertrain. So you know right now, it's a very-very hard market to reach, both in terms of demand and of course, supply. I think, automotive has been extremely hard hit by the closures globally. So you know, we see, I would say the two areas of most interest, Tore, are the infotainment, the car experience, leveraging for example, our A2B technology, our heritage and digital signal processing and audio signal processing in general, adding for example, active noise cancellation to the portfolio, and we're deploying that -- starting to deploy that now. So I think the whole Infotainment side of things is an important part of the go-ahead, and that's a place where we have a lot of heritage and where we're actually increasing investment. We just acquired a company actually during the quarter to enable us to bring more signal processing to the audio space.In the electric vehicle area, I think it's got a long, long road ahead of it, as the electrification today, the powertrain as a portion of overall car sales, is only about 1%, certainly less than 2% of total car sales. So a long, long way to go and that's an area where we have strong position. We're on our fourth -- our fifth generation of technology now, product delivery to that sector. So I'd say in those areas, we are actually increasing investments. However, there is another area, the cross-connect of power into our business, particularly in Europe and the U.S., that's an important initiative and we're seeing some very good green shoots there, in terms of early stage production of designs -- of power designs that we've attached to the signal processing portfolio.I think it's also true to say Tore, that probably on the safety side of things, we've been decreasing our investments over the last several years, partly in MEMS, you'll recall, three, four years ago we withdrew most of our investments in that area. So I would say safety is more opportunistic. Infotainment and electric powertrain, more strategic. -- Tore, do you have a follow-up? -- Yes, that was very helpful. Follow up for Prashanth. Prashanth, I do realize obviously right now, the orders are kind of all over the place. But if we start to see deterioration, what would be the company's playbook, especially on things like manufacturing, utilization, inventory because it seems like some of your peers have different playbooks, just wondering what ADI's playbook will be, in response to potentially weaker or continuous weaker orders? Thank you. -- Sure. Yeah. So Tore, let's do that in two pieces. First, think about how we manage our costs. So in the near term, how we think about costs and you've seen it in the opex results already. We have a variable comp structure that is intended to act as a shock absorber, and that unwinds as revenue falls. On the discretionary side, we've already frozen hiring. We've essentially got travel at zero. We've exited consultants and any discretionary contractors and perhaps most impactful is, we've deferred our merit increase, which is usually 2% to 3% year-over-year. We are on track to realize about $35 million of synergies that we announced last year in November and we still have $100 million of cost synergies that will come through by the end of 2021. So there are some more permanent actions that we can take and we have taken in the past, such as furloughing employees until demand returns. We did this back in 2008-2009. We would certainly put activities, like temporary actions on the table. So there are all items that we will think about.On the manufacturing side, I would emphasize that our utilizations are fairly low right now. So we're kind of at the trough levels. Inventories are -- we feel at a good position. So I don't think we have kind of the same inventory exposure that we would have had, at the same time last year. We've reduced on the balance sheet, as well as in the channel. So overall, I think we're well positioned, if this breaks up or should it break down. Maybe Vince, you want to talk a bit more about kind of longer term? -- Yes, on inventory, we feel good about the stability -- the diversity and stability of our business. And with the profit margins we generate as a company, we are investing to make sure we come out of this trough, a stronger company, both in terms of product development, as well as customer engagement. So we also believe very strongly in the persistence and the pervasiveness of our technologies. So I believe that the story for ADI gets stronger with the tailwinds that we have and the portfolio that we have for the future.So look overall, our goal is to take advantage of the disarray, and while I think Prashanth said in his prepared remarks, we're preparing for the worst, but we're executing aggressively for the future. -- Very helpful, thank you. -- We will go to our next question, please.And our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the good execution. I'm curious, Vince, what -- in the communications segment, just near term, did you see any level of pull-in from China or Huawei in either April or July? And then as we get beyond the current environment, do you see any further impact from all the restrictions on Huawei, or do you think that share will be shifted over to Huawei's competitors. So longer term, you can start to regrow your communication segment? -- Well, Vivek, let me answer the second part of your question first. So we have tremendous coverage. We've got very strong market share across all the providers, all the OEMs of for 5G across the globe. So irrespective, I mean the networks are going to get built, and whoever builds will be using our stuff, our transceiver technologies, our microwave portfolios, many, many other ancillary analog technologies. And so I feel good about the position that we're in. If share shifts from one to the other, we will pick it up. And so the -- in terms of demand, I would say, we have reconciled. So it's pretty clear what the carriers are saying about the deployment of 5G globally right now. Our reconciliation, in terms of how we balance the demand of the carriers, is with -- it is very tightly tied to our supply. So we have a good sense for what the carriers are looking for and that's how we're planning essentially the the factory loadings to support this particular area.So I don't think -- I mean, you asked about, are we seeing double ordering, and so on and so forth? What is characteristic in the base station infrastructure market over many-many years is that, you get gyrations, you know, when a set of contracts are coming due, you see some level of, I would say, core need and a certain amount of redundancy built in. But it's pretty typical. What we're seeing right now in terms of 5G is no different, than what we've seen in terms of these dynamics, how 4G operated in terms of demand. -- Hey Vivek, remember on the call, what we said publicly about that large customer in China. A year ago we talked about them being a mid single-digit customer. They have been reduced meaningfully since that time, they are more around the low-single digit percent of sales today, and as we look forward to our third quarter and beyond, we don't see that changing from there. You have a follow up, Vivek? -- Yeah. Very helpful, thank you. On gross margins, how should we think about the trajectory from here, given all the puts and takes of mix, and I think, Prashanth, you mentioned fab underutilization but then you also mentioned some of the cost synergies. So let's assume sales stay at similar levels even going into your Q4, what can gross margins do then? Thank you. -- Sure. Yeah, good question Vivek. So our model is 70% long-term and you saw that in good times, we can get up to 72% plus, and in more challenging times like now, we're sort of in the high 60s. So through and through a cycle, we can average 70%. Getting to 70% is very macro dependent. As demand gets better, we are going to get utilization tailwind, we have, as I mentioned, utilizations are near trough levels now. What we have in our favor, is an additional $100 million of cost of goods synergies. So that should begin to to give some tailwind as well to our gross margins. And then as 2021, returns to kind of growth numbers, then I feel that it's reasonable for us to kind of to get back to that 70% level. -- Thank you. -- And to everyone on the call, in the interest of time, we're going to go to one question per caller to get through a bit more.Thank you. And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hi, thank you very much. Prashant, I had a question for you on -- a couple of quick ones. Opex trajectory, how should we be thinking about it? And then on capital allocation, is it fair to assume that given all the volatility, that share buybacks stays paused for now? -- So for opex, we are in our sixth quarter of consecutive improvement in opex. Some of that is clearly actively managing the the spend levels down, but some of it is also the result of this COVID situation, where travel is at a freeze. I think it's reasonable to expect that, as businesses reopen and customer expectations start to change and we need to get back in front of folks that some of that is going to climb and as well as some other discretionary spend, we'll will come back in. So I wouldn't run this level of opex out too long, but I think you've seen that we have been incredibly diligent with managing our opex over the last year and a half, and that's a muscle that ADI has built, and we're not going to let that go.In terms of how to think about the capital allocation, our framework really hasn't changed. The first call is to invest in the business, and whether that is organic or inorganic, and then after that, it's really 100% return of free cash flow after debt repayments. So the plan for 2020, we increased the dividend by 15%. We are still intending to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million in this fiscal year, and then everything after that goes back to shareholders, either through dividend or or share repo. So I would expect that we would be -- if the business holds out, that we would be reactivating the share repo in the coming quarters. -- Thanks Ambareesh. Can we go to our next caller please?Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Hi guys. Congrats on the strong results in challenging times. Just wanted to go back to the automotive side, you said it will be down sharply, so just a couple of questions on that. Do you mean sequentially year-over-year or both, and given the timing of when the auto factories have been shut down, and then are turning back on, how are you viewing the shape of that recovery and how much of that turning back on dynamic influences your thoughts for both your July guide and your October outlook conceptually? -- Yeah, thanks for the question, Ross. So I think first and foremost, we expect sequential and annual declines. It is extremely hard to read the automotive sector right now. I think it's easier to predict how factories will reopen and how supply will happen, I think the bigger question is what is going to happen with demand, and I think the way we view it is that, we don't understand the pace of reopenings right now, and what level of utilization or capacity will they operate. So I would say, we think it will be tough going for the remainder of this year in automotive, and perhaps we start to see a recovery in the first half of the coming year. So that's how we're viewing it. So the area that we feel kind of most conviction around, in terms of demand will be for electric vehicles, where our portfolio is making very strong headway, which was originally centered really in China, into Europe and of course America as well. So very-very hard to read I would say, but my sense is that remainder of this year will be tough and we'd start to see a pretty paltry bottom I think, some recovery in the first half of '21. -- And Ross, I would say that is reflected in our guide. We're relatively bearish on automotive in our guide. -- Thanks, Ross. Cheryl, our next question?Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi guys, good morning and congrats on the strong results. Vince, I wanted to ask about your BMS business specifically, how did that business trend in the quarter, what's the outlook into July, and if you can give us an update on customer traction with your wireless BMS solution into the back half of the year and potentially into fiscal year 2021, that would be helpful? Thank you. -- Yeah. So overall, in the quarter just gone you know, we saw a modest decline, I would say in our BMS revenues. But our design and hit rates are very, very strong, We are set to -- at the present time, we are somewhere in the region of 45 -- 40% to 45% market share of BMS and we believe that, that share will grow above 50%, given the design pipeline that we have and the commitments that we have from customers across the globe. As I mentioned in the previous answer there, we've managed to take what was a very China-centric BMS business, we've been taking it across the globe and that's for -- essentially the non-wireless side of things. The wireless battery, we are expecting to see our first production of that particular product happen in the -- kind of I think the second half of 2021. So that's how we see it. We're in a great position I think right now in North America, China, and we're also beginning to penetrate Japan and Europe, I think, is in the early stages of adoption, at any kind of meaningful level, and I feel good about where we are there.Our portfolio is highly differentiated. There are many pretenders out there, but when it comes to optimizing the miles per charge, we got more than 20% gain in that -- along that metric. So overall, it's a 1% to 2% penetration of the car sector. It will probably go to 25% over the next five, 10 years and we're in a very-very good position to see the tailwinds from that, as time plays out here -- Thank you, Toshi. We'll go to our last question please. -- Thanks Toshi.Thank you. And our last question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hey, thanks guys. I guess more of a clarification than a question. So you mentioned that you've seen a little bit of weakness in the April-May bookings. Does the guide take into account further weakening in the bookings? Did you build in any cushion or are you assuming stability from here now? -- Yeah. So I think we feel good about our guide, Chris, we don't want sort of guide out there, that we don't think we can -- based on what we know today, we can get to -- orders were down in April. May was at a slower pace. Our expectation in the guide is that orders continued to slow through the quarter or best case, might stabilize. We've got good coverage from the backlog, more than we normally do. So we're prepared for some cancellations or push outs, because we would have -- we always had some turns business in there. We're trying to control those cancellations or push outs, as I mentioned, by being pretty tough on the terms that we have for direct or disty customers, and we've also assumed that the channel is relatively flat, inventory levels sequentially. So we think we've calibrated the guide as best as we can, knowing what we know today. -- Thank you, Prashant. -- Thanks Chris.Thank you and I'll turn the call back for closing comments. -- Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website at investor.analog.com. You can also find our recently published ESG report, Engineering Good, there as well. Thanks again for joining us and your continued engine Analog Devices. Stay healthy.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Image source: Instagram.Facebook announced Tuesday that it would move forward with its plans to help small businesses establish an online presence using its proprietary platforms. Facebook Shops will use the power of Facebook, Instagram, and other services to help local businesses advertise their goods and services on the internet. Online storefronts will be available for users of both Facebook and Instagram, and users can provide customer service and support using messaging services WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram Direct.Facebook hasn't been as aggressive in pushing into e-commerce as some had hoped, but Facebook Shops represents a big move in that direction. One stock analyst said that Shops could bring in as much as $30 billion in revenue over time. More importantly, the offering would keep more businesses within the Facebook ecosystem, supporting its other efforts.There aren't many stocks at all-time highs, but Facebook is finding its way through the COVID-19 crisis. Investors should be pleased at what they're seeing, and the company has a lot further to go if it can keep up its pace of innovation.Shares of Analog Devices rose even more sharply, gaining 8%.

Revenue was down 14% from year-ago levels, sending adjusted earnings per share down by 21%. However, Analog's sales picked up from where they were three months ago.Moreover, Analog has taken steps to shore up its business in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of its products are used in key medical equipment to fight COVID-19, and Analog has prioritized production and shipment of those products.Perhaps most encouraging was Analog Devices' guidance for the fiscal third quarter, which includes projections for roughly flat sales and net income compared to fiscal second-quarter levels.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"  management seemed confident of the company's ability to withstand the novel coronavirus-related uncertainties a couple of months ago. It also sweetened its dividend with a hike of 15%.But Analog pulled its fiscal second-quarter guidance toward the end of March, citing supply chain disruptions and an uncertain demand environment caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite that, the broader stock market rally has lifted the company's shares, making Analog Devices stock relatively expensive considering that its business was facing  even before the pandemic started shutting the economy down. data by Analog stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E ratio) of 32, which tops the five-year average multiple of 30. It may not be a great idea to buy the stock at its current valuation because, according to the company's last guidance numbers, its top line was supposed to drop 12% in the second quarter.What's more, Analog's revenue in the fiscal first quarter that ended in February was down 15% year over year. The withdrawn guidance suggests that the economic impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak may deal a bigger blow to the chipmaker in the current quarter.Image Source: Getty ImagesSo don't be surprised to see Analog investors hitting the panic button when the company releases its quarterly results on May 20.Another problem with Analog Devices is that the company's balance sheet doesn't appear to be solid enough. Its debt of nearly $6 billion easily exceeds the total cash position of $654 million, while free cash flow has been heading south over the past year. data by This means that Analog's free cash flow generation could keep going south in the coming quarters if the decline in its top and bottom lines accelerates.That won't bode well for the . Analog management pointed out over the last  that the company returned ""more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments."" In the first quarter, the chipmaker had bought back $106 million worth of shares and paid out $200 million in dividends.For the full year, Analog expects to pay down between $300 million and $500 million in debt. The company will now have to think of using its cash more wisely, as the economic fallout of COVID-19 could squeeze its financials.Analog's interest expense in fiscal 2019 stood at $229 million, and it repaid $850 million in debt. Its dividend payments for the full year came in at $777.5 million, and the company had bought back $613 million worth of its stock. Analog was able to meet these commitments thanks to nearly $2 billion in free cash flow that it generated during fiscal 2019.Buoyed by last year's impressive cash flow performance, Analog hiked its quarterly dividend substantially in February this year, sending its forward dividend yield to an impressive 2.44%. So Analog may have to cut a few corners this year with respect to debt reduction and share repurchases if the cash flow performance takes a substantial hit. If Analog is unable to meet its debt reduction target, its interest expenses will be higher than what the company was originally expecting. Similarly, a slowdown in share repurchases means that its earnings per share won't be getting the boost that the company was aiming for.All in all, it doesn't make sense to buy Analog Devices at current levels.Analog Devices management struck a confident tone back in February, even though the novel coronavirus-related headwinds were threatening. According to CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah:In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remained relatively resilient into the second quarter.However, Analog Devices gets nearly half of its revenue from the communications, automotive, and consumer businesses. The bad news is that all these businesses witnessed steep double-digit annual declines, ranging from as low as 16% to 31% in the first quarter. The industrial business, which supplies 53% of the total revenue, was the only bright spot with a relatively smaller decline of 7%.The bad news for Analog Devices is that the auto, communications, and consumer businesses will continue to face headwinds on account of COVID-19. Auto sales, for instance, are  while the deployment of 5G networks is also expected to run into delays. Demand for consumer electronics devices such as smartphones has collapsed as well.A turnaround at Analog Devices looks unlikely amid all these challenges, making this  a risky bet given its relatively expensive valuation and a not-so-great balance sheet.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Chip Stock Pays a Nice Dividend, but Should You Buy?@2020-04-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-chip-stock-pays-a-nice-dividend-but-should-you-buy-2020-04-28
"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Invesco S&P 500— Pure Growth ETF (Symbol: RPG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $140.26 per unit.


With RPG trading at a recent price near $121.21 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.72% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of RPG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Qorvo Inc (Symbol: QRVO), Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), and Edwards Lifesciences Corp (Symbol: EW). Although QRVO has traded at a recent price of $97.30/share, the average analyst target is 27.95% higher at $124.50/share.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"Investors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 29th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new May 29th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $99.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $99.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $94.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $101.07/share today.

Because the $99.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.92% return on the cash commitment, or 35.95% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $99.50 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $102.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $101.07/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $102.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.77% if the stock gets called away at the May 29th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $102.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $102.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.85% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.39% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 70%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 66%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $101.07) to be 49%.

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , in trading on Friday, shares of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.48), with the stock changing hands as low as $120.81 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.  Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.



In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

"Investors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options begin trading this week, for the September 18th expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 204 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $100.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $111.27/share today.

Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $111.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00.

Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $115.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q1 2020 , Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 , which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. -- Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. Moving on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and the relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.Now on to the disclosures. Information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.Our comments today about ADI's first quarter of fiscal 2020 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. The comparative results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from their prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? -- Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. While our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, as you all have seen, importantly, we managed our operating costs and working capital effectively to position ourselves to deliver margin expansion in the quarters ahead.Before I discuss the quarterly highlights, I'd like to address the coronavirus outbreak. First and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of those affected and of course our employees. We're doing everything we can to provide our customers with the support they need to minimize disruption to their businesses. And while the situation remains fluid, we are monitoring it closely. Prashanth will expand on the financial implications in just a while.So now on to the first quarter, revenue was $1.3 billion, down versus the prior year, but in line with our expectations. Operating margin was approximately 37%, a decline versus last year due to lower revenue and our decision to lower utilization. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.03 above the midpoint of guidance. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 35% free cash flow margin and this continues to place us in the top 10% of the S&P 500.On our call last quarter, we shared our priorities for 2020, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress so far. Priority one is the efficient use of our capital. The first call in our capital is funding new product development activities. In the first quarter, we invested over $250 million in R&D with more than 90% of this spend targeting the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets.For example, an area of increased focus for ADI is our power franchise. Here we've been increasing R&D to enhance our strong position in the broad markets and to extend into new opportunities across areas like data center, automotive and 5G infrastructure. Our power design win momentum remains strong and we expect to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead of us. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders, and we just announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend.Priority two is deepening customer centricity. As I've shared before, the combination of our broad product portfolio, domain expertise and manufacturing capabilities sets ADI apart. We're always anticipating the technology needs of our customers and engaging with them fairly in order to solve their toughest challenges. And I'd like to share just a few examples specific to our automotive segment with you now.Our A2B platform continues to gain traction in the cabin electronics ecosystem. By leveraging our platform portfolio, we're opening up new applications for our customers, such as active noise cancellation. In the quarter, Hyundai became the 14th auto manufacturer to incorporate A2B technology. And together, we announced the industry's first all-digital road noise cancellation system. With the rise of active noise cancellation, we're creating stickier customer relationships due to the integration of our hardware and software capabilities, while increasing our SAM [Phonetic] per vehicle.There's also a lot of intensity and urgency in OEMs moving toward electric powertrains. We were an early player in the market partnering with industry leaders to improve the efficiency of the battery in electric vehicles. As a result, our BMS solutions are delivering greater miles per charge and monitoring battery health more accurately. In the U.S. electric vehicle market, we are benefiting from near-term strength as customers ramp production. And new design wins across future models will help us to deliver on our long-term objective of growing BMS revenue at a double-digit rate.Priority three is capitalizing on the secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversifying growth. We've previously discussed with you key secular trends across our company, such as 5G electric vehicle factory automation and data center. Now today I'd like to spend some time on the space market, perhaps a more obscure sub-segment of our industrial sector. Our space customers' challenges are not just around RF, signal processing and power management, space solutions must also perform under extreme cosmic radiation and conditions of high temperatures.We solve these challenges through the combination of our comprehensive product portfolio and the passive knowledge base built over many decades of serving this market. While space represents a couple of percent of ADI's total revenue today, the command stellar margins, and we see potential to double the business over the next five years.Now, let me share a little more with you about why this sector is exciting to us. The space market is rapidly evolving. Over the last decade, unprecedented levels of capital have gravitated toward this vertical, thereby increasing the number of privately funded space companies by 20 times. Therefore, new technologies and capabilities are emerging that are leading to new opportunities for ADI. This includes the advent of low earth or LEO communications satellites. These satellites are becoming the new frontier in space with forecast suggesting that by 2020 over 20,000 will be in orbit up from just hundreds today.To provide some context, LEO satellites differ from today's geostationary or GEO satellites. Technologically, they provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, which enable real-time communication. Operationally, they continuously change their position relative to the earth and only stay connected with a given terminal for approximately 10 minutes. As a result, the number of terrestrial terminals that communicate with these satellites whether they're on the ground or in the air will grow into the millions with the proliferation of LEO satellites.To succeed in creating this network, both satellites and terminals must be capable of being steering. This requires an exponential increase in channel count enabled through phased array antennas, an architecture that is used in 5G networks already today. And as you can imagine, more channels packed into smaller form factors is increasing thermal and power hard disk [Phonetic]. To help solve the engineering challenges of creating this ubiquitous and always connected LEO network, our customers are increasingly turning to ADI; looking to us to not only be a supplier, but indeed a key system architect.So we're engaging with customers early in their design process to develop end-to-end solutions from antenna to bits combined with power capabilities to deliver the required performance and of course robustness. Our ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of space grid solutions across the entire analog spectrum from RF and signal chain to power is unique and this cannot be completely replicated by any of our competitors, making ADI the go-to supplier for our traditional OEMs, as well as the next wave of disruptors.All told, we see the LEO communication satellite band becoming at least four times the size of GEO over the next five years. And with LEO refresh cycle compared to today's satellites, we expect our space business to deliver a steadier stream of revenue in the years ahead. In summary, space has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver and unlock value across other verticals as well. Once fully operational, these LEO networks will provide real-time, reliable high-speed connection globally, ushering an opportunities from autonomous driving to telesurgery.So in closing, and speaking broadly about ADI, I believe demand for our solutions will be unprecedented as technological innovation underpinned by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity continues to grow rapidly. And as I look ahead, I believe we're very well positioned to deliver sustainable profitable growth and indeed strong shareholder returns.So with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth. -- Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter . My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. ADI delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue came in line with our outlook as we meaningfully reduced channel inventory. And through our disciplined spending, operating margin and EPS were above the midpoint of guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.62, an increase of 15%, the high-end of our target range of 7% to 15%. The dividend is the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy and this represents the 17th increase over the last 16 years. These consistent increases reflect our commitment to strong shareholder returns, as well as our optimism about the long-term prospects for our business.Before getting into the income statement, let me first cover the end market. In line with our expectations, our first quarter B2B revenue declined 15% year-over-year, as better than expected industrial demand was balanced by softer communications activity. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, declined 7% year-over-year. As we forecasted, most applications within this highly diversified business declined, while aerospace and defense once again grew double-digits year-over-year.Communications, which represents 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 31% year-over-year as wireless and wired both declined. While communications is an inherently lumpy market, our position has never been stronger or more balanced across the ecosystem. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, which we continue to expect will be a multi-year tailwind.Our auto business, which represented 16% of revenues during the quarter, declined 16% year-over-year due to weakness across all applications. As Vince highlighted, we remain confident in auto due to our strong pipeline of customer wins, especially in our infotainment platform and our market-leading BMS position.And lastly, consumer, which represents 13% of revenue during the first quarter, declined 20% due to portable applications. As we said in our last , we expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment.Now onto the P&L. Gross margin came in at 68.5%, up slightly sequentially and down 180 basis points year-over-year as favorable mix was offset by lower utilization. As a reminder, fab utilization was near trough levels this quarter in order to reduce our balance sheet and our channel inventories. Opex in the quarter was $412 million, down 4% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. In light of the softer revenue environment, we curtailed spending and have delivered sequential opex declines in each of the past five quarters. As a reminder, we plan to exit fiscal 2020 with $50 million of annualized savings across cost of goods sold and opex.Operating margin finished at approximately 37%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $47 million, down $3 million sequentially and $9 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. All told, first quarter adjusted EPS came in above the midpoint of guide at $1.03.Now moving on to the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory was reduced by about $20 million or 4% sequentially. Despite this reduction, our inventory days increased 133 due to the lower level of revenue. Recall that our target for inventory days is 115 to 125, but during the process of closing two legacy LTC facilities, we do expect to carry an additional five days to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers. We also reduced channel inventory by approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and plan to reduce channel inventory in the second quarter again, but to a lesser degree.Capex in the quarter was $55 million or about 4% of revenue. And we expect to end fiscal 2020 slightly below our 4% long-term target. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $2 billion or free cash flow margin of about 35%. Over this period, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. We paid approximately $200 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million of our stock in the first quarter. We still plan to pay down between $300 million to $500 million of debt in fiscal 2020.Now I'll provide some context on our recent business trends and our current view on the coronavirus. In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remained relatively resilient into the second quarter. However, unsurprisingly, we have begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China demand for industrial, automotive and consumer is minimal for all of February before returning to a more normal level in the last two months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout. So while forecasting business dynamics in China is very difficult today, our guidance reflects our best estimates.So looking ahead at Q2, revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This includes an approximately $70 million revenue reduction due to the near-term risks with the -- associated with the coronavirus. And as I said earlier, we expect to reduce channel inventory again, but to a much lesser degree than in the first quarter. At the midpoint of $1.35 billion, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase mid-to-high single-digit sequentially with growth across all of our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications.Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be up sequentially to approximately 37.5%. We are planning for our tax rate to be between 10% and 12% for the quarter and we are improving our fiscal 2020 outlook to between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.08. While we are mindful of the uncertainty around us, I echo Vince's optimism, we are encouraged by near-term trends that point to a stabilization and improvement across end markets and we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.Let me give it back to Mike now to start our Q&A. -- Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we'll give you the opportunity for a follow-up. Operator, can we have our first question please?[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi guys... -- Good morning, Vivek. -- This is Jamie Zakalik. Hi, good morning. This is Jamie on for Vivek. Thanks for letting us ask the question. So similar to peers, you guys noted some stabilizing and improving trends in end markets in the January quarter, but it seems that growth has actually decelerated across all the end markets. So I guess are the improving trends more in the -- in February even with a lot of these virus headwinds? And is it specific to any end market or geography or is it more broad-based? -- Yeah. So Jamie. I think the first quarter was in line with what we expected. So there was deceleration going into the first quarter. Now remember that in this quarter we undershipped the channel. And as I said in my prepared comments, we undershipped by $40 million. So on a revenue rec basis, PO ship-in was $40 million below sell through.As we go into the second quarter, orders were improving over the course of the first quarter and we expect that to continue into the second quarter with this note that we made on disruption in China where we believe some of this demand is going to get pushed out to future quarters. So I do think that our view here is that we've sort of bottomed out and it's better from here through subsequent quarters. -- Yeah. Maybe I can add a little bit of color as well from a market perspective on that. So what we're seeing is in spite of what looks like a delayed 5G employment -- deployment in China, in the second quarter, we are expecting growth, actually quite good growth in our communications 5G sector, as well as wireline. And you know that growth is becoming a little more broad-based. We're seeing, I would say a green shoots in the factory automation and process control side of things as well, which is a significant part of ADI's industrial business and also gathering strength in the ATE sector. And from an automotive standpoint, we're seeing particular strength in our business in America, as well as Europe at this point in time. -- Given the long of that answer, we'll kind of push to the next caller please, Sheryl.And our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Yes. Thank you. Vince, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more there on 5G. You said it's becoming a more broad-based business. Just trying to understand geographically where the growth is coming from because obviously it's not coming from China near-term. So if you could elaborate a bit on that that would be great? Thanks. -- Well, I think, Tore, China has taken a pause. Asia is still at this point in time in terms of deployments today, Asia is by far the strongest in 5G. I think what we're seeing is the -- probably a faster roll-off in 4G than we had anticipated, 5G has taken a bit of a pause in China, but is set based on what we see in terms of demand is set for a ramp during the second quarter. And also I pointed out that wireline for ADI in general, whether it's data center, whether it's metro or long-haul networks is doing quite well. So as we come into the second quarter, our book-to-bill has been -- is well above one and that gives us the confidence in the growing strength of that business through the second quarter here. -- Thanks, Tore. Do you have a follow-up? -- Yeah, just a quick one. Prashanth, you did a good job lowering channel inventory. It sounds like you're going to lower a bit more again this quarter. Could you maybe give us some targets either by weeks or what dollar amount that you're trying to lower them by? -- Well, I think, Tore, we had mentioned in the -- in our first quarter or fourth quarter call that our goal was to get back to our target range by the end of the second quarter. It may take us a little bit longer now given we didn't include the impact of the coronavirus in the top-line. So we're still heading toward the same channel inventory target that we've had before. But with a bit of a softer top-line, I think it might actually be end of third quarter before we're back in range. -- Very helpful. Thank you. -- Thanks, Tore.And thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Your automotive business was down 16% in the quarter, which was in line with your guidance, but relative to peers, a little worse on a year-over-year basis. Vince and then Prashanth, you guys talked about your optimism around some of the design win activities in BMS and infotainment, but in the near-term, what's driving kind of the double-digit decline in your automotive business? Is that mostly channel inventory reduction? Are you losing share? I guess more importantly, how are you guys thinking about kind of the through cycle growth rate for your automotive business over the next couple of years? -- Yeah. Well look, we have been very, very clear. The two growth drivers for ADI in the automotive sector are the infotainment area, A2B, active noise cancellation, audio signal processing in general and of course BMS has been over the last couple of years a double-digit growth driver for ADI. I think in the quarter just passed, BMS, which has a route, a strong route in China has suffered as a result of the virus. And -- but you know when we look into the second quarter, we expect our -- as I said, our second quarter has better trends in North America and Europe. So we're expecting modest growth in the second quarter.The headwind for ADI has really been the safety sector where our 24-gigahertz radar technology is declining, probably at a rate a little faster than I had expected. And also in the area of MEMS, more of the kind of the passive safety MEMS where we withdrew investment three or four years ago. So I think we'll begin to bottom out I think on those headwinds. Specific to safety, we have a new safety modality in 77-gigahertz which is by all accounts, very, very exciting for our customers. We will see the bottoming I think of the MEMS and the 24-gigahertz radar decline. So my sense is in the areas we're effective, powertrain, infotainment, we're very, very well positioned to grow those sectors over the next two, three, four years. -- Thanks, Toshi. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. Prashanth, I had a question on the actual weeks of channel inventory, and I might have missed it. But did you give an actual number, I think you were 8.5 weeks in the prior quarter? -- We did not -- we did not give a number, Ambrish. The -- what I mentioned is we took the channel inventory down $40 million. But if you do the math, we're still going to be above our target range because the revenue -- the numerator has moved but the denominator has also shrunk. So on a ratio standpoint, the weeks is still high, but we did take a big chunk out and we're going to take more out in Q2 as we mentioned. -- Okay. -- Do you have follow-up, Ambrish? -- I did. Vince, maybe for you. In the two areas, real quick on industrials. What's the right way to think about given what's going on in China? And broader, how to think about return to growth in the industrials business? You guys outperformed last year, but what -- how should we think about year-over-year growth returning? And then in comms, we always ask you about wireless, I had a slightly different question. How is -- how are you guys positioned in wireline versus if you look back at two, three years ago? And then what gets you excited about the design wins that should be ramping out in wireline? Thank you. -- Thanks, Ambrish. Let me try and address the industrial question first. So we are seeing our aerospace and defense business continue to grow at double-digit rates annually. We are seeing, as I said, a little earlier on the factory automation side of things outside of Asia is on a, I'd say, a solid improvement in its demand pattern. I think inventory hangover has largely been taken out of the equation in the industrial sector.So I think when you look -- when we look at the impact of the virus in China, we are not expecting really anything in the industrial sector in terms of shipments there for the month of February. But all that said, we have a very solid book-to-bill in the industrial sector. And we will get I think a decent increase in our top-line in industrial during the second quarter.On the wireline side of things, our game there is really two pieces. We have a very strong -- we've a strong leadership position in optical control systems for data centers. So all of the fangs for example would use our technology in their data centers for control of the optical signal chain. And also the cable market we have a good position there and infrastructure system. So wireline business has been growing high-single-digits now for several years, and I don't see any decline in that. I think that will be a decent growth driver for ADI. It run into the region of $400 million annually in terms of sales at the present time. So I view that very much, Ambrish, as a tailwind for the company. -- Yeah. Ambrish, I'd also add industrial side. We did take down channel inventory meaningfully, a lot of that relates to industrial. And if you look at industrial, kind of zoom out and look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, we're only down low-single-digit, which is a pretty good performance in a tough macro backdrop and that goes to the diversity of that business. With that, Sheryl, we'll go to the next question.Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter. But I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. I think you guys did a very good job now kind of talking about your capital allocation. But what I'm having a hard time understanding is kind of the margin mix here, I realize that space and satellite is probably higher margin, I'm guessing like 80%, 90% gross margin, but you guys are actually coming down a bit on the gross margin line. Can you maybe talk us through what the gross margin profile should look like in the first half and the second half? And then how they would flow through to the operating margin line as well? -- Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Mitch. So I guess a little bit of a background, right? Our model is 70% gross margin is our long-term model. And in good times, we were operating at 72%. In more challenging times, like now, we're down in the high-60s. So through the cycle 70%. As we move forward from here, we see two things that are going to be impacting margins, both utilization and mix. So Q1 represented the trough level of our utilization expectations for the year. So a fair amount of underabsorption at our internal manufacturing facilities that gets better from hereon and that will be tailwind to margins.And also, as some of the questions that were asked, Vince mentioned the strength in industrial, we expect industrial to continue to be growing as we move forward, and industrial in general is one of our highest margin businesses. So that will also provide tailwind. So we -- I would expect that you could see sequential improvement in gross margins through the balance of this year, likely getting back to our model margins in the second half, maybe toward the end of the year. -- Okay. That's very helpful. And then I just have one follow-up, just in terms of the seasonality for the business. I think maybe you should probably be taking a little bit of a more conservative view in April just because it didn't sound like China is going to open up March 1. But when I look at the July quarter going from April to July, should that be I guess above seasonal given that April was depressed from all the macro items that are going on? -- All right. So the guide for our second quarter included a $70 million adjustment that we made at the top for the impact of the coronavirus. And the math that we used to arrive at that is we essentially zeroed out February in China for industrial and auto and consumer. And then we also made an adjustment for communications being pushed, the deployment of 5G being pushed out a bit just because of the labor challenges that are going on there.We expect that to begin unwinding as in the subsequent months and certainly be back to normal in the third quarter. Could it be above normal? That's certainly a possibility. It depends on the timing of how that $70 million comes back. It's our current view that that is purely a timing shift that that is not locked demand. But as to when that falls back in, it's hard to say. But the order activity certainly suggest that it's not going away. -- Okay, perfect. Thank you. -- Thanks, Mitch.Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. -- Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to zero in first on comm. So it sounds like you're pushing it out some. Your prior guidance for comm last year was for it to grow year-over-year, and it feels like you're backing away from that. But the trajectory in the second half on the old guidance was for very strong sequential growth kind of every quarter going forward. How should we be thinking about the trajectory of comm in the second half, I guess given -- I guess the bump in Q2 versus the profile that was -- that you had in mind three months ago when you gave this guidance. Do you still expect to see a similar ramp maybe just off a lower base? -- Yeah. So just a few things, Stacy. For the first quarter, a little bit lower than we expected mainly due to the 5G pause that started in the second half of '19. Moving into the second quarter, orders have begun to come back in very much as we expected and our book-to-bill is above one. So that's supporting a strong sequential increase in second quarter for both 5G, but also as Vince mentioned, we're seeing some good strength in wireline as have been reported by number of peers as well.The sequential increase is below our initial expectations because of the -- a lot of that was related to 5G timing in China. So I think everything is moving a little bit to the right here. So it's hard for us to say at this point whether the timing of that recovery is still going to put us up year-on-year, but I think we'll have to see how quickly this demand recovers and whether the installations happen as -- is it caught up in the year or not. But we feel very good that this is really a dislocation of demand versus actual loss or destruction. -- Yeah. I'd say one other comment on that, Stacy. Our optimism about what's happening in America related to 5G has strengthened over the past quarter as well. So yes, we have the disruption in China. It's really a delay of demand rather than destruction. But my own sense is that we'll probably see more activity in the back end of the year in the U.S. relating to 5G. -- Do you have a follow-up, Stacy? -- I do. Thank you. So it sounds like also, even though we have the delay because of coronavirus in China that the order patterns still seem to be very strong. How do we think about the strength of those Chinese orders in relation to potential increases in sanctions that we've been hearing about? Do you feel like there is any sort of scramble on the part of Chinese customers to get out in front, although sanctions -- I guess what you're seeing in terms of customer behavior in relation to the regulatory? -- Yeah. I think first off, when you look at the geopolitical machinations, it's actually very hard to figure out what's going on. So -- but I think with our business in general, we have many thousands of customers in China, many thousands of product SKUs and we see ongoing demand. There are obviously areas where we are restricted, particularly in 5G. But I think the rest of our business right now is in a kind of a normalized market and regulatory situation. So the demand we are seeing is despite the disruption here because of the virus. The demand in China is actually quite strong across the board otherwise. -- Let me rephrase the question. If all of a sudden like the de minimis threshold gets dropped from 25% to 10% and the foreign direct products gets strengthened and they put more stuff on the control list, does that impact how you guys view the trajectory in China as we go through the year? Would you have to reevaluate what you can ship and what you can't? -- Well yes, we would have to reevaluate. But remember that we have adjusted one large communications customer down from a traditional mid-single to low-single-digit as a percentage of revenue. So that is kind of -- that's the limit of our exposure depending on what happens to that particular customer. -- Yeah. I think that very much depends on the scope of what happens. And so far everything we've seen is relating to one specific area of communication. So unknown, Stacy, but we'll see, time will tell. -- Got it. Thank you, guys.Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to follow-on the comments about the opportunity to double Linear's growth in the coming years. And Prashanth, if you could talk about, I know there's some gross margin levers as you consolidate manufacturing and just kind of how you're viewing on that in terms of the growth profile versus kind of margins for Linear in the next couple of years? -- Sure, sure. So I'll take the margins side of it and then in terms of doubling the growth, I'll let Vince comment. On the margins side of it, we have talked about the focus we've got on shutting down two facilities. We've taken -- we've made announcements on those. We've actually been able to accelerate some of the savings for the -- for one of the factory closure. So we're going to start seeing some of that benefit in cost of good sale at the end of this year. But the balance of that $100 million, we see feathering in over 2021. And as we have stated in the Q4 earnings call, our intention is to let -- to kind of let all of that come through the bottom line. So we are not looking to redeploy that cost of good savings. So you should see some lift in our gross margins on an ongoing basis as we exit 2020 and through 2021.In terms of kind of the progress we're making to double that Linear growth rate, let me hand that up to Vince. -- Yeah. So we're -- I think we're making good progress, Craig, in trying to equalize the value of the kind of legacy ADI mixed signal technology value in a given application with power. So we're looking for equivalents. For every dollar of mixed signal, we expect to get a dollar of power, and that's what the market opportunity available is.I can tell you that our pipeline for the OTC portfolio and specifically power is up about 40% actually year-over-year. And we're moving into production on the automotive sector, the communication wireless sector, wired, we're in early volume production as well. So we expect to see those areas ramp in terms of meaningful impact on the top-line during 2021. And there are many, many, many new sockets in the industrial area that we're working on. So that will just take a little longer given the slower uptake in terms of turning design-ins to revenue. But I think a lot like Hittite, we feel -- we went through this process with Hittite, we've doubled the size of that company that franchise over the last five years. And I think we're in a very good track right now with LT to achieving 200 basis points, 300 basis points of top-line growth based on the strength of the portfolio and the activity at the customer level that we're seeing. -- Thanks, Craig. We'll go to the next caller.Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Good to see the fundamental is starting to improve here. A&D grew greater than 20% last year. Defense budget was approved beginning of this year at strong, up 4% versus last year, and you guys expect double-digit, continued double-digits year-over-year growth here this year in A&D. Is most of the strength coming from the defense segment or are there also programs in the commercial aerospace, satcom sector that are starting to fire as well? -- Yeah. As I said in the prepared remarks, obviously defense budgets are in our favor in terms of buying technology and deploying it. So we're in good shape there. And yeah, we're seeing strong double-digit growth in the space area as well. And that's relatively -- we've had a good position there, but the -- if you like, the explosion in the launch of LEO satellites and GEO satellites is really increasing demand for the company. And we're looking at in these applications many thousands of dollars of content for satellite kind of thing. So we're very optimistic about that, but it's a combination of both, both parts of that business are really growing well.Harlan, I would say, remember, think about defense as when DoD gave some money to the primes and the primes start deploying it, this is going into design decisions that were made many years ago. So we are enjoying the flow of that larger budget into the primes and then to us for decisions that were made some time ago. We still have quite a bit of great design activity that has yet to be funded. So that's all going to come.On the aerospace side, it's holding as well as it can be expected given the environment that's going on there. And then in space, as Vince mentioned, space is really in front of us, that growth is in front of us so while. That has been growing at a nice clip and continues to. We feel even more optimistic about what's in front of us coming both from space and future design win activity that happened for the defense business. -- Thanks, Harlan. We'll go to our last caller please.And our last question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. Two of them really. First, hoping you can provide some update or commentary as to the competitive situation and maybe the legal competitive situation with an FPGA supplier in high-performance converters, maybe competitive trends as to design win traction relative to that vendor? -- Well, broadly speaking in terms of competition, we are -- we've outgrown our closest competitors for the last, the last three years. And so we're clearly gaining share across the board in communications and industrial in particular. So I think competitively. We're in good shape. I think pricing is very, very stable as well. So I think overall, legacy is strong, our design pipeline is strong and we're excited about the new R&D programs as well that are coming to fruition for the company.In relation to the litigation with as you said, large FPGA company, you know we will give you -- as new information emerges, we'll be transparent with you and we'll communicate with you. But at this point all I can say is that we're confident that this matter is going through the courts, it will be successfully resolved and we are defending our IP very aggressively and we believe we have a very, very strong case. So that's what it is. It's within the courts, but we're very optimistic with how things are going. -- Do you have a follow-up, Will? -- Yeah. I appreciate that. Just on the Covid impact. It sounds like what you're saying is that you're assuming certain orders are zero for February given where the February 19, I assume that's actually what you're seeing in the order book. Is there any anticipation for weakness later in the quarter? And also any supply disruption that you're noticing at all? Thank you. -- Sure, yes. So on the orders, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it is very hard to kind of size the activity of what's going on in China. So when we arrived in our 70, we wanted to give the investor and analyst community what assumptions are we using knowing that these are very dynamic. So for our assumptions, we've taken our China activity to zero in February and pushed out a little bit of 5G.On the supply chain side, we are not seeing much disruption at this standpoint. We had some of our back-end suppliers early on were struggling just with getting some labor into run their activities, but that's also been resolved as time has settled out here. So from our standpoint, our supply chain and we just revalidated this with the guys this morning, our supply chain we feel good about. -- That's great. Thank you. -- Thanks, Will. And I think it might be helpful given your question, kind of given our outlook of B2B what we think these market is going to do because it seems a little bit of confusion out there of how we think the market is going to do. We think each market grow sequentially. We said in total B2B will be up mid-to-high single-digits. Our rank order [Indecipherable] I'd say comms is a little better than that. Industrial does in line with the overall look and auto does a little bit worse. So that kind of help you think of how the Covidien -- sorry, how the corona is impacting our business.And with that, thank you everyone for joining us. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and information can also be found on the Quarterly Results section of our website.

"The coronavirus outbreak in China is turning out to be a challenge for a wide swathe of companies. Several big names in the tech sector have blamed the outbreak for negatively affecting their businesses. Smartphone giant , for instance, recently  as iPhone sales in China are expected to take a hit due to store closures driven by coronavirus concerns.Not surprisingly, chipmakers dependent on smartphones, automotive, communications, and other businesses with China exposure have been in limbo.   is the latest to join this bandwagon as the company had to reduce its second-quarter revenue estimate by $70 million to account for the potential business impact.Image source: Getty Images.The end-market conditions looked ripe for Analog Devices to  this year after its businesses suffered in 2019 thanks to the restrictions imposed on Huawei by the U.S. government. The company was banking on the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) wireless networks to boost its communications business in 2020 and beyond, but that might be pushed out now.On the latest , management said the coronavirus outbreak is expected to reduce the company's revenue by $70 million during its fiscal second quarter. The chipmaker is looking at $1.35 billion in revenue for the period, which would be a decline of nearly 12% from the prior-year period.This doesn't paint a good picture for the company as revenue was down 15% annually during the fiscal first quarter as well. But the company's tepid results and shallow outlook didn't deter investors from bidding up the stock as much as 7% as management painted a bullish overall picture about the direction in which the company's business is moving.""Encouragingly, demand across our end markets has stabilized and is beginning to show signs of improvement as we enter our fiscal second quarter,"" CEO Vincent Roche said.The company also pointed out that it is witnessing ""weaker demand"" because of the Chinese New Year. It also sees the possibility of a delay in 5G rollout, which will impact the company's communications business.Despite all these negatives, investors are giving the company some leeway this time. That's not surprising considering that Analog sweetened the deal for investors with a 15% quarterly dividend hike, coming in at the high end of its 7% to 15% guidance range.The impressive payout increase is not surprising, considering Analog is focused on returning all of its free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. The good thing is that Analog has managed to keep its free cash flow at a stable level in the past year, despite a declining top line, through its focus on cost controls.Analog's operating expenses were down 8% year over year last quarter. The company is looking at another $50 million in annualized savings this fiscal year on the cost of goods sold and operating expense fronts, which should help mitigate the impact of near-term revenue challenges on the bottom line to some extent.But Analog investors shouldn't forget the fact that the stock is valued richly right now, especially considering the headwinds it faces.Even after the historic broad market decline last week, Analog Devices stock is currently trading at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 34, which is significantly higher than the five-year average of 30. Looking ahead, the stock also trades at 23 times forward earnings estimates, again topping the five-year average multiple of just 19.For fiscal 2020, analysts estimate Analog Devices' top and bottom lines will decline this year, so it remains to be seen how the chipmaker manages to sustain its rich valuation. If Analog Devices disappoints investors in the upcoming quarters, don't be surprised to see this  pull back substantially.As such, investors should wait for Analog Devices' end-market improvements to actually reflect on its financial performance before going long.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Chip Stock Might Be Getting Ahead of Itself as Headwinds Loom Large@2020-03-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-chip-stock-might-be-getting-ahead-of-itself-as-headwinds-loom-large-2020-03-01

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options become available today, for the January 2020 expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new January 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $117.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $117.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $113.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $118.27/share today.

Because the $117.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.74% return on the cash commitment, or 19.97% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $117.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.00.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $118.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.00% if the stock gets called away at the January 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.54% boost of extra return to the investor, or 18.52% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 31%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 34%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $118.27) to be 30%.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.40.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $103.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $115.73/share today.

Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.33% return on the cash commitment, or 6.76% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.85.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $115.73/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.15% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.48% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 33%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 30%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $115.73) to be 30%.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"As the famous Wall Street maxim goes, ""Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered."" The saying warns against approaching investing as if favorable conditions proceed without interruption.The current bull market run started in March 2009, meaning we're just months away from an 11-year bull run. Even if the current bull market doesn't make it to the 11-year mark, this has still been the longest rally in U.S. history. That doesn't mean you should panic and dump all of your holdings. Timing the market remains incredibly difficult, and history has shown that the vast majority of investors will be best served by staying in the market, rather than attempting to predict when a crash might hit and the right time to jump back in. It's a matter of allocation.Investors are right to be thinking about when the next recession and market crash will hit. Shifting holdings to high-quality defensive companies poised to deliver solid performance through thick and thin remains the best move. Three recession-resistant stocks, in particular, pay dividends and are worth buying this January. Image source: Getty Images.While the  index's level fell roughly 24% from 2008 through 2009, 's  share price rose roughly 12.5% -- and the retailer's market-beating performance remains similarly impressive if you compare it to the major index on a longer timeline and include dividend payments.  data by Walmart's dividend-adjusted return from 2008 through 2011 crushed the dividend-adjusted return for the broader market, and there's a good chance it will once again be resilient when the next downturn hits.The table below charts Walmart's annual sales and earnings performance across its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2009, through its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2011 -- a period spanning The Great Recession (which kicked off in December 2007 and lasted until June 2009) and the economic malaise that lingered for years after.Source: Walmart.As the table shows, Walmart's business continued to post solid performance even amid the challenging economic backdrop, and it's in a good position to keep chugging when the next recession hits. Walmart's budget-focused model and one-stop-shop retail experience have made it the go-to big box chain for customers looking to save time and money.If a recession hits and purse strings tighten in the U.S., that could encourage shoppers to head to Walmart over other alternatives. It also gives the company avenues to sales and earnings growth in the U.S., even if shoppers are being more careful with their money.Walmart's progress in developing its international and e-commerce businesses should also be a boon.

Even if a recession hits this year, 2020 will likely see dramatic advancements for the rollout of 5G technology and devices that support and rely on the the next-gen wireless networks -- and this tech shift is still very young.Shares trade at roughly 25 times this year's expected earnings and sport a dividend yield of roughly 1.9%. The company also boasts a 15-year streak of annual payout growth -- a stretch that includes the duration of the Great Recession and the still relatively lean economic times that followed soon after.Analog Devices' earnings multiples might look a bit steep, but its profits have been depressed this year, and  going forward.Shares are valued at roughly 21.5 times the average analyst target for 2020's earnings, and the company's sound core business and potential to see big benefits from tech trends like 5G could prove to be a positive long-term catalyst. might be slowed by potential economic downturn, but tech becomes increasingly integral to other sectors every day -- and Analog Devices is positioned to benefit.Infrastructure needs don't simply disappear during a downturn.   wouldn't be completely immune to a downturn, but most of the  (MLP) cash flow comes from long-term contracts or investments in predictable regulated markets. Investors can count on performance to be pretty resilient, even in the event of recession.In the company's most recent shareholder letter, Chief Financial Officer Bahir Manios explains Brookfield Infrastructure's steady performance:  The low volatility in our underlying results stems from the fact that 95% of our cash flows are either contracted or regulated. We operate regulated businesses in five different continents, invest in businesses with very attractive regulatory frameworks and all of that with very well-established regulators. These are in great countries like the U.K., the U.S., Australia, and Brazil.If economic conditions hold strong, that's certainly good for Brookfield Infrastructure. However, the partnership looks well positioned to weather economic downturn, and it's been making moves with the business investments in its portfolio that should drive growth. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners has been selling off investments that appeared relatively mature and using the proceeds to build its positions in more fields, including telecommunications, North American rail distribution, and natural gas pipelines.  The company is valued at roughly 11 times its funds from operations over the trailing 12-month period, a valuation that looks appealing in light of its recession-resistant portfolio structure and strong dividend component. Brookfield Infrastructure units (the MLP equivalent of shares) sport a 4% distribution yield, and the partnership has increased its payout for 12 consecutive years and boosted its dividend by roughly 755% over that stretch. As an MLP, Brookfield Infrastructure is subject to some specific tax rules that mean it's probably not a great fit for tax-privileged retirement accounts. Otherwise, it looks like an attractive income-generating investment that can weather volatility and deliver impressive long-term performance.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he Cambridge Dictionary’s definition of an expert is a “person with a high level of knowledge or skill relating to a particular subject or activity.”Apply this to the investing world, and how do we see this in action? We pull out TipRanks’  and notice who sits at the top of the heap.Occupying the throne right now is renowned investment bank RBC Capital, which means that among the company’s employees there are seasoned pros with a proven track record for success. Utilizing the  tool, we’ve found three stocks receiving Strong Buy ratings from most analysts in general, and endorsed by RBC in particular. Let’s take a closer look:Ovid Therapeutics shares are on a tear. The stock price of this neurological medicines firm has raced ahead 66% this year, leaving the Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) in its dust. But would you believe it has even further to run? Would you believe it could go up another 200%? RBC analyst  does. In his latest research note, Abrahams reiterated an Outperform rating on OVID, along with a price target of $12.00 (To watch Abraham’s track record, )The drug maker has several therapies in the pipeline. Leading programs in development right now are OV101, which focuses on a potential treatment for Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome, two neurodevelopmental disorders caused by genetic mutations, and OV935, a program focused on developing potential therapies for people living with rare epilepsies.Top-line data from a Phase 3 NEPTUNE trial of OV101 in Angelman's Syndrome should be released in mid-2020, and Abrahams thinks there is a very reasonable chance of success. While acknowledging some risk given disease heterogeneity, unclear dose dependence, and inconsistent subdomain effects in ph.II, the 5-star analyst noted, “We believe clinical and preclinical data for the company's lead candidate OV101, an extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist, are in totality supportive of the drug's activity in Angelman Syndrome, and believe the stock price currently underappreciates the likelihood the drug succeeds in improving clinical symptoms of the disease in ph.III. Given the high unmet need in this population, we believe FDA will be permissive -- highlighted by the Agency's endorsement of the pivotal trial design -- and if approved, should enable good uptake and pricing power.”Other analysts are even more optimistic. Indeed, the average price target on Wall Street is $13.50 -- implying nearly 240% upside. And over the last three months, no one on the Street has assigned Ovid shares anything less than a ""buy"" rating. This year has seen a number of car crash IPO’s, as several over valued startups got on the receiving end of a harsh reality check following public listings. One to avoid such a fate, is cloud computing ‘connected planning’ platform, Anaplan.The company’s name derives from the combination of analysis and planning, which makes sense to us, as it makes software that connects people in a shared environment to business data in order to make better-informed plans and decisions.Anaplan impressed Wall Street with its latest F3Q20 earnings report. The company handily beat expectations on several key metrics, including top-line, billings, and margins. Additionally, this led to management significantly boosting its FY20 guidance.RBC’s  believes that a ‘large addressable market’ can serve as a catalyst for Anaplan’s growth, noting, “Anaplan indicates that the Planning market is a $21B+ opportunity (based on IDC forecasts). We believe customers are paying legacy vendors billions of dollars today and there is potential for spend significantly above that if greenfield, excel-based business processes meaningfully start to convert to Planning vendors.”Anaplan’s growth potential has Zukin reiterating his Outperform rating, along with a price target of $70. PLAN is currently trading at $52.56, indicating gains of 33% might be in the cards should Zukin’s target materialize. (To watch Zukin’s track record, )What’s the Street’s plan for PLAN, then? The consensus is that the connected planning innovator is a Strong Buy, a rating achieved as a result of 9 ""buy"" and 3 ""hold"" ratings issued in the past 3 months. The average stock-price  of $63.33 implies upside potential of 20% from current levels. Last and least, we come to semiconductor maker Analog Devices, which scored an ""outperform"" rating (i.e. ""buy"") from 5-star RBC analyst ADI stock is up nearly 38% in 2019 compared to the S&P 500, which has returned 24%. That’s impressive, but the big question for investors is whether the company (and its stock) can maintain the momentum. Steves suggests that if everything goes as planned, ADI will be a $136 stock in the next 12 months, implying about 18% return. (To watch Steves’ track record, )The company’s recent FQ4 numbers were mildly below Street expectations. Revenues of $1.44 billion slightly missed the Street’s estimate of $1.45 billion, while EPS of $1.19 came below the $1.22 estimate. FQ1 guidance also missed the Street’s targets.Steves commented, “We continue to believe that sentiment is still quite negative on the stock and remain positive as operating margin expansion should begin in Q2 and beyond [...] We remain positive on ADI and its suggestion of a recovery in Q2 is in line with our Analog view as well.” The analyst further added, “We are seeing positive trends within ADI’s communications business, as the company manages to sustain share gain and capture 5G opportunities. Being exposed to 5G radio content represents significant differentiation relative to the analog group, in our view.”The RBC expert is not alone in his take on ADI, as 11 Buys and 3 Holds from the analysts tracked by TipRanks over the last 3 months result in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at $125.57.

"nalog technology giant   reported fourth-quarter results early Tuesday morning. Share prices fell as much as 4.7% at first as the company fell short of analyst expectations across the board. The market reaction turned around to a small gain during the , where management painted a more handsome picture of market conditions in 2020.Data source: Analog Devices.  = generally accepted accounting principles.Your average Wall Street analyst had been looking for adjusted earnings near $1.22 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of $1.45 billion. These projections were set in line with the midpoints of Analog Devices' guidance ranges, which in turn were below Street estimates when they were issued three months ago.Guidance for the first quarter also fell below the current analyst views across the board. Sales are expected to fall 16% year over year, landing at $1.3 billion. Adjusted earnings should stop in the vicinity of $1.00 per share, 25% below the year-ago period's reading. Analysts had been looking for earnings near $1.18 per share on sales of roughly $1.43 billion.Management pinned the soft results and equally weak first-quarter forecast on ""continued trade and macro uncertainty.""Given the disappointing results and next-quarter forecasts found in this report, the 5% drop this morning wasn't much of a surprise.Image source: Getty Images.The  came along at 10 a.m., Eastern time, with far more encouraging words from Analog Devices' management.CEO Vincent Roche spelled out how customers in the communications and industrial end markets are partnering with Analog Devices to drive analog data collection and processing in an increasingly complex business environment.""We are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling solutions with our comprehensive portfolio of high-performance mixed-signal RF, and microwave, and power management technologies,"" Roche said. ""To that end, as we enter 2020, our opportunity pipeline value is at record levels and increased more than 15% year-over-year.""Later in the call, CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah added a deeper discussion of market trends pointing to a weak first quarter but substantial improvements beyond that.""From a macro level, it's our take that we're kind of bouncing along the bottom. Certainly, there is ongoing uncertainty with the trade war that's impacting overall demand and customers are putting a pause on CapEx spend,"" he said. ""For communications, in 5G, there is a lull between deployments. [...] It's very early days on the 5G and we are expecting demand to kind of stay soft through the end of this calendar year, but pick up nicely for 2020.""The company is managing some inventory overload in the first quarter, expecting to get back to full manufacturing capacity in support of that 5G trend in the second quarter. The weak seasonality of Analog Devices' first-quarter results will be amplified by these effects, getting back to business as usual in the following period.As a major player in the , found at the heart of many component supplier pipelines, Analog Devices functions as a bellwether for the technology industry as a whole. This weak earnings report isn't doing the tech sector any favors, but management's rosier view of 2020 turns that argument upside down.Taken in the context of optimistic comments from chip industry peers such as  and   earlier this earnings season, we might be in for smoother sailing in 2020.

"  has been hit hard by the semiconductor slowdown this year. The company's revenue in the recently concluded fiscal year 2019 fell nearly 3.7% over the prior year, driven by the  in key chip markets such as the industrial and automotive sectors.However, investors have been buying Analog Devices stock despite the headwinds. The stock has generated a decent return even in tough times, paving the way for more upside in 2020, when things are expected to get better. Let's take a look at the reasons you should consider going long on Analog Devices right now. data by .Analog Devices' fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter results revealed that its industrial business has started turning around. The company's industrial revenue increased slightly year over year to $744 million, accounting for 52% of the overall top line.Analog credits the slight improvement in its industrial revenue to ""strength in aerospace and defense, healthcare and electronic test and measurement"" markets. More importantly, the company anticipates that the industrial business will get better from the second quarter of fiscal 2020 once the inventory correction is over in the first quarter.Responding to an analyst query over the , Analog Devices CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said that he estimates a sequential increase of 5% to 10% in industrial revenue during Q2. The recovery Analog anticipates starts making sense if we consider that the overall semiconductor market is expected to bounce back strongly in 2020.Image Source: Getty Images.According to , worldwide semiconductor market revenue is expected to increase by 5.9% next year following a drop of 12.8% in 2019. The aerospace and defense sector, for instance, is expected to stage a comeback next year. Deloitte anticipates a 3% to 4% increase in defense spending in 2020, while demand for commercial aircraft is also expected to pick up the pace.An industrial recovery, however, is not the only catalyst for Analog Devices next year. The company's communications business saw strong momentum last year, enjoying 12% annual revenue growth thanks to the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) wireless networks.Though the communications business did take a hit in the final quarter of fiscal 2019, Analog believes that it will be back on track next year, since 5G rollouts are still in their early phase. According to CFO Mahendra-Rajah, ""We are at the early stages of the Global 5G rollout, and we remain confident in our expectation that our comm's revenue will grow in 2020 and beyond, given our market-leading position and higher content opportunity in 5G.""All of these tailwinds have expanded Analog's opportunity pipeline to the tune of 15% for next year, according to CEO Vincent Roche. So there's a good chance of Analog Devices making a nice comeback in 2020 on the back of the secular growth opportunities in the industrial and communications markets.Analog Devices has delivered a decent stock price upside this year. But at the same time, the company also pays . Its dividend yield of 1.90% is better than the 1.5% average dividend yield of tech companies in the S&P 500. More importantly, Analog Devices has raised its dividend 16 times in the last 15 years.This makes it an ideal choice for investors looking for a combination of growth and dividend in a single stock, especially considering the potential turnaround that could happen in 2020.Analog Devices follows a philosophy of returning 100% of its free cash flow to investors through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. The company returned 120% of its free cash flow by this method in the last fiscal year after repaying $850 million of its debt.Analog's free cash flow generation took a slight hit last year as its top and bottom lines declined, but  could take care of that and help the company bump the dividend once again. data by .In all, Analog Devices can give investors the best of both worlds. Its growth could go up a notch as the catalysts listed above come into play and lead to stock price upside, while the dividend will provide investors with a regular income stream.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them!

"Investors' focus has locked in on semiconductor stocks following news of a potential ""phase one"" trade deal between the U.S. and China. Many chipmakers do production work in China and/or distribute products to Chinese companies, so the industry has suffered a nasty case of whiplash throughout the two or so years of the two countries' tariff spat.The upside is that the volatility still is coming out on their side. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF () has soared nearly 40% year-to-date, doubling the already better-than-average returns for the S&P 500. While trade enthusiasm has helped, the industry also is recovering from inflated inventory levels that have weighed heavily on the space.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Stein wrote in October, ""Looking through any tactical correction (due to tariffs), the big move is still to the upside. We believe patient investors will be rewarded for being long semis."" And Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari wrote in July that chipmaking equipment companies' fundamentals could improve ""sooner than previously expected.""Here are five semiconductor stocks to buy to take advantage of an improving outlook for the industry. We took advantage of TipRanks'  tool to pinpoint five chip stocks that have recently accumulated bullish sentiment from Wall Street analysts. Let's take a look.
Market value: $22.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $108.11 (13% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Microchip Technology (, $96.08) is a semiconductor company that manufacturer of microcontrollers, analog chips and other products. These products are used to power everything from home appliances to medical devices to space travel.MCHP recently got a shot in the arm thanks to an Oct. 1 vote of confidence from KeyBanc's Weston Twigg. The analyst believes the demand-and-inventory issues that bogged semiconductor stocks down last year are subsiding for a few companies, namely MCHP. ""We were encouraged to find inventories beginning to normalize and expectations for normal seasonality in 4Q,"" he writes.Twigg upgraded Microchip from Sector Weight (equivalent of Hold) to Overweight (equivalent of Buy) and set a $110 price target, implying 14% upside over the next 12 months.Twigg isn't alone. Over the past three months, Microchip has received eight Buy ratings versus just one Hold. Among the Buys is B. Riley FBR's Craig Ellis, who highlighted Microchip's ability to manage inventory levels. ""MCHP was characteristically early in flagging a correction in August 2018 and then responding with assertive inventory management thereafter."" Ellis has a Buy rating and a $120 price target on Microchip shares, implying 25% upside. .
Market value: $7.8 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $23.46 (24% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: ON Semiconductor (, $18.97) produces a wide variety of custom, discrete and logic semiconductors across several continents. It gets about a third of its revenues from automotive clients, though its products are used in a variety of industries, from communications to computers to aerospace and defense.ON shares are up 17% year-to-date, which is only a little behind the market but significantly behind the SOXX. Nonetheless, its positioning in the ""fastest growing semiconductor end-markets,"" as CFO Bernard Gutmann said in the most recent , has several Wall Street analysts keeping ON among their top semiconductor stocks to buy.Benchmark's Ruben Roy is among the analysts singing ON's praises. ""Many of ON's focus market design wins are single-sourced as opposed to being multi-sourced in the computing and consumer markets, which ultimately should lead to more stability in top-line performance,"" he writes. Roy, who also expects the company's shift toward higher-end markets to drive margin improvements, rates ON a Buy with a $26 price target (37% upside).Raymond James analyst Chris Caso is optimistic, too. While he points out that the company is exposed to trade war and macro-economic threats, he believes investors should buy the stock for its ""reasonable"" valuation. He raised ON from Market Perform (equivalent of Hold) to Strong Buy and set a $21 price target, implying another 11% upside potential from current prices. .
Market value: $40.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $123.43 (12% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Analog Devices (, $110.59) is another analog producer that also offers mixed-signal and DSP integrated circuits. Shares are up 29% year-to-date, and analysts see further upside in part because of the promise of its multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology.MIMO, and ""massive MIMO,"" use groups of antennas to allow devices to transmit more data, making wireless spectrum more efficient. Among other things, telecoms see massive MIMO as important to unlocking the true potential of the 5G technology they're rolling out.According to Barclays' Blayne Curtis, the massive MIMO and millimeter wave (mmWave) silicon market could double to $6 billion by 2022. He believes Analog Devices is best positioned to benefit from this emerging space, calling ADI the ""clearest winner in Massive MIMO."" Curtis upgraded ADI to Overweight in September and lifted his price target from $105 to $130, which is 18% better than current prices.Loop Capital analyst Cody Acree (Buy) delivered a smaller price-target update, from $120 per share to $125, in September. He believes 2020 will be a ""stronger environment"" for semiconductor stocks, and that Analog Devices will get a boost from its hyper-scale datacenter products. He also thinks the inventory correction will help out ADI's industrial business, which makes up about half of sales. .
Market value: $33.9 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $33.29 (8% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Advanced Micro Devices (, $30.81) is a semiconductor company that develops graphic processors, motherboards and microprocessors. But it has really made a name for itself in recent years with its Ryzen CPU that has given  Intel () a run for its money.In fact, AMD recently scored another win against its larger rival: Microsoft's () new Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X will be powered not by Intel, but by AMD Ryzen processors.To be clear, analysts aren't gushing about AMD at the moment. The ""smart money's"" sentiment is more bullish than it isn't - it has 8 Buys versus 1 Sell over the past three months - but 12 analysts are sitting on the sidelines, maintaining Hold ratings as they wait for more clarity.Still, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann argues that the Microsoft collaboration is an impressive victory for AMD. ""Huge win for AMD with a semi custom APU with integrated graphics (aka APUs) for the new Microsoft device (first time at 15-inch),"" he writes, adding, ""This is just the beginning of the relationship with AMD, as next year AMD rolls out even higher performance 7nm CPUs and APUs.""""Note that the street is reluctant to believe Intel would allow AMD to take leadership in desktops, much less laptops or servers,"" continues Mosesmann, who reiterated a Buy rating and $42 price target, or 36% upside. ""This is a multi-year AMD cycle.""Nomura's David Wong sees more upside on top of AMD's 67% year-to-date run, too. Wong reiterated his Buy rating Oct. 1, shortly after the company announced the availability of a pair of professional desktop processors built on its groundbreaking 7-nanometer technology. That follows its launch of the first 7nm CPU, the Epyc Rome, in August.""We think that AMD is doing an excellent job of executing on its 7nm product roadmap and that this lineup of new products will help it continue to drive desktop processor market share gains in the coming quarters,"" writes Wong, who reiterated a Buy rating and $37 price target (20% upside). Get the scoop on .
Market value: $118.3 billionTipRanks consensus price target: $191.59 (1% downside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Nvidia (, $194.21) actually rates among many analysts' top semiconductor stocks to buy, despite its price target implying a small amount of downside from current prices. NVDA has garnered 20 Buys versus just five Holds and two Sells over the past three months. Nvidia's shares have shot up a quick 16% over the past three months, however,  reaching those price targets more quickly than some analysts expected.What's important to watch out for next is whether analysts start upgrading those price targets in response.According to Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse, investors should also pay close attention to the growing demand for gaming notebooks that feature Nvidia's GPUs. Muse said earlier this month that Nvidia could start enjoying a boost  this year that continues will into 2020. He believes the company's Gaming division could experience at least 15% annual growth through 2022 - and that's before considering business wins for its cloud gaming products. Muse has an Outperform rating (equivalent of Buy) on the stock, but more importantly, he raised his price target from $185, which NVDA has surpassed, to $225, which adds another 16% upside.RBC Capital's Mitch Steves is on the same page, predicting in October that Nvidia will be the ""best-performing large cap in our universe over the next six to nine months"" thanks to its datacenter, gaming and auto segments. Indeed, Steves thinks the datacenter business could double in the near term. He also bumped up his price target from $190 to $217 (12% upside). .Maya Sasson is a content writer at TipRanks, a comprehensive investing tool that tracks more than 5,000 Wall Street analysts as well as hedge funds and insiders.

"ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at , in trading on Thursday, shares of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.16), with the stock changing hands as low as $107.85 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.  Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.



In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

t's no secret that global growth has slowed in 2019, and the industrial economy in particular has taken a downturn. The near-term outlook is negative, but long-term investors don't buy stocks with a quarter-by-quarter view. The big question is when the cycle will turn positive again. With this in mind, three companies giving earnings reports in November --  ,  , and   -- will help to provide answers for investors in stocks ranging across a wide swath of industries.Image source: Getty Images.The company is one of the , and as such, its revenue is other companies' capital spending, making it a key bellwether of overall industrial conditions. The company gives its fourth-quarter results in the middle of November, and aside from the general market commentary, there are three things to keep an eye out for.First, management believes that organic sales will decline by 3% to 3.5% in the fourth quarter, but aside from the headline number, investors should focus on the architecture and software systems segment results and revenue growth outlook -- it tends to be more exposed to short-cycle spending patterns and so will lead the direction of Rockwell's overall sales.Data source: Company presentations.The second thing to look for is its guidance on its automotive end market.  expecting flat sales growth from the automotive end market, only to reduce expectations to a mid-single-digit decline on the  in January and then cut it to a 10% decline in April. Will Rockwell meet this guidance? And what will Moret say about 2020?Third, semiconductor spending has been weak in 2019, but companies that supply the market such as , , and  have all been pointing to improving conditions lately, and it wouldn't be a surprise if Rockwell indicated potential improvement too -- something to look out for.Speaking of the semiconductor sector, Analog devices will give earnings toward the end of the month, and investors will be looking to see if the sector has really passed a trough, as Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser believes it has.The company's year-over-year sales growth has been in negative territory for the last four quarters, and it's hard to expect much improvement from its automotive end markets, while communications growth has been driven by 5G spending. However, considering the brighter outlook given by some of its peers, it's possible that Analog could report some relatively positive numbers on its consumer end markets and some stabilization in its industrial end market.Analysts have the company eking out 1% sales growth in 2020, and it will be interesting to see whether the company guidance matches or even meets that estimate as it reports its fourth-quarter 2019 results.Meanwhile, for broader market watchers, it's worth noting that semiconductor capital spending is often seen as being a very early-cycle activity, and if it comes back, investors can feel more positive about the general economic outlook in 2020.Data source: Company presentations.Agricultural and construction machinery company Deere will also give its fourth-quarter results at the end of the month. The key things to look out for are its outlook for U.S. and Canadian agricultural machinery equipment sales in 2020 and its overall construction equipment sales forecast.It's been a complicated year for the company, with a combination of the fallout of the trade war (agriculture has been a key battleground, leading to a slump in U.S. soybean exports to China) and African swine fever causing dramatic declines in China's pig herd and consequently its demand for soybean meal.As such, management now expects its full-year U.S. and Canadian agricultural equipment sales to be flat compared to a forecast for flat to up 5% . The key question is what Deere will guide toward for 2020. The answer will tell investors a lot about how the trade war is impacting the U.S. agricultural sector.Data source: Company presentations.Deere also has a construction equipment business, and as you can see in the table above, the construction segment has also lowered full-year guidance through the year. That said, there's been some evidence of an improvement in the construction end market recently -- for example, industrial supply company  and  turned positive in October after a few months in negative territory.Given the recent strength in the S&P 500 and the 24% gain so far this year, the market appears to believe the industrial economy will avoid a recession. However,  will feel a lot more confident if companies like Rockwell, Analog Devices, and Deere give decent outlooks, and what their managements say will guide investors as to which sectors are best placed to invest in during 2020.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them!

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q4 2019 , Good morning, and welcome to Analog Devices Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 , which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. -- Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO Vincent Roche and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. If anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.Now onto the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.Our comments today about ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.As a reminder 2018 was a 53-week year and does include an extra week of operations. In today's remarks, we have normalized our fiscal 2018 results to a 52-week year, so that our comments on annual growth rates make for more accurate comparison.And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? -- Thanks, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, we delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results against what was a backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions and ongoing trade uncertainty. Importantly, we made progress positioning ADI for continued long term success, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.In the fourth quarter revenue was $1.44 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $1.19. For the full year revenue was approximately $6 billion down slightly year-over-year. As double-digit growth in our communications market was offset by slower demand across other markets. Specifically collective revenue from our B2B markets of industrial, communications and automotive increased slightly compared to 2018 led by strong demand across the wireless communication sector. Given the current operating conditions, we continue to actively manage our business reducing operating expenses.All told, full year adjusted EPS was $5.15. We generated approximately $2 billion in free cash flow. While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is below our long-term operating model. We continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500. ADI is a diverse business across customers, products and applications that positions us to succeed in any macro environment. And in 2019, we added to our cutting-edge technology portfolio through strategic investments while partnering even closer with our customers. The resiliency of our business model in any economic environment is evidenced by our B2B revenue outperforming the industry in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. And we're not standing still.To that end, let's turn to our priorities for 2020. Priority one is deepening customer centricity. We possess the broadest product portfolio, applications expertise and manufacturing capabilities and high performance signal processing. This enables us to solve our customers' toughest challenges at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. The factors driving customer demand are first, our customers are facing a scarcity of available analog design engineering talent and thus they are increasingly turning to us for that expertise.Second, the challenges our customers face in the third wave of information and communications technology are becoming ever more complex. In this world digital systems increasingly rely on real world information to make mission critical decisions and the accuracy and the integrity of this information is becoming more important.As a result, our customers are partnering with us more deeply to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product inventions and innovations. We are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling solutions with our comprehensive portfolio of high performance mixed signal RF and microwave and power management technologies. To that end, as we enter 2020, our opportunity pipeline value is at record levels and increased more than 15% year-over-year.Priority two, is the efficient use of capital. First, R&D is critical to our Company's success. And in 2019 we invested $1.1 billion there. To continue this virtuous cycle of innovation-driven success, we choose our investments wisely and when necessary pivot quickly, targeting the most attractive opportunities, particularly across our B2B markets.This long-term approach to R&D allows us to continue to innovate and fortifies our position against any economic backdrop. Second, we're extracting value from our acquisitions to complement our R&D and drive long-term value creation. With the Hittite acquisition, we became the market leader in high-performance RF with a portfolio that spans DC [Indecipherable] gigahertz. Since the acquisition five years ago, we've more than doubled Hittite's revenue.And in the last year our RF franchise revenue increased over 30% led by industrial and wireless communications growth. The LTC acquisition out of high performance, power management and precision signal processing to our portfolio positioning us to provide more fully integrated solutions and capture additional value. Due to the combination with LTC, we're building our power pipeline, which is up nearly 40% over the past year and beginning to deliver new revenue streams for example in Power, we've won designs across 5G infrastructure, datacenter and automotive that are moving to lower volume production in 2020. Ahead of a more meaningful ramp in 2021. This puts us on a path to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead. In addition, we are making steady progress on the next phase of our LTC cost synergies which Prashanth will elaborate on just a while.Third, we're committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. Our target is to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. And in 2019, we returned more than 120% of our free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments.Priority three is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. And some examples include, for example, in 5G wireless, we are pushing the innovation curve on our market leading integrated transceiver by adding digital capabilities, algorithms and optimized power solutions. This enables customers to scale channel count by 8 times, while managing size and thermals. And 5G isn't just about wireless, it will also require a complete rearchitecting of the core and wireline network to meet the 5G vision of gigabit speeds, low latency and high reliability demanded by mission critical applications.This network expansion will require a significant upgrade of the backhaul system opening a new revenue opportunity for ADI's optical and point-to-point microwave solutions. For electric vehicles, we have the highest performance BMS solution providing customers with up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. Next in our roadmap is revolutionizing how monitoring and controlling batteries will be sold and that is wirelessly. This creates a more accurate, reliable and necessary approach to measurement for the entire battery life from formation to implementation to reuse.With the rise of Industry 4.0 factory floor are becoming more digital with greater sensing measuring and actuating activities. In turn this creates additional demand for our precision signal chain franchise as well as extensions to this franchise into new areas. For example, our innovative software IO solution enables greater flexibility across the factory floor and high performance power is essential to managing heat dissipation as information density increases at the equipment level. however, it's not just about our core technologies, digital factories are also creating new TAM for our suite of connectivity and sensor solutions.And last but not least in healthcare, to build upon our strong growth trajectory, we're extending our high-end component franchise with integrated modules, increasing our bond. We're also extending our signal processing hardware and algorithms into new areas such as glucose meters, surgical instruments and digital health applications that predict and manage chronic disease.So in closing at the start of this year, I shared the adage [Phonetic] [00:19:24] with you that a rising tide lifts all boats, and that the true test of the company's strategy and business model is its performance during the low tide. Despite the external turmoil, for the full year we posted approximately 70% gross margins, best-in-class across the semiconductor industry and almost 41% operating margins, in line with our long-term operating model.As we look ahead, we are hopeful that market demand will improve as early as our second quarter, and in an ever-changing world, we remain focused on being agile and responsive to market dynamics demonstrating courage in creating and seizing opportunities, showing additional prudence in our investments while driving continuous improvement across every facet of our business. Longer term the data era is creating an inflection across our industry. I believe that ADI prospects are extremely compelling as our product portfolio is aligned with favorable secular trends that I believe will provide tailwinds for many years to come.And so with that I will turn over to Prashanth. -- Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. And let me add my welcome to our Q4 '19 . As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comment on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which exclude special items outlined in today's press release. So let's start with the fiscal 2019, which was a solid year for ADI. Revenue finished at $6 billion, down a modest 2%, while our B2B revenue was up slightly despite continued trade and macro uncertainty.As Vince shared our margins continue to be strong. Gross margins were approximately 70% and operating margins were 40.6%. Adjusted EPS was $5.15. Free cash flow was approximately $2 billion. We repaid $850 million of debt, paid $780 million in dividends and repurchased over $600 million of stock. All told, after debt payments we returned 120% of free cash flow to our shareholders.So now let's look at the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.44 billion was down 6% year-over-year as flat industrial was offset by broad-based weakness across our other end markets. So I'm going to go through some commentary on the individual markets.Industrial, which represented 52% of revenue in the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year. Trends were similar to the previous quarter where we saw strength in aerospace and defense, healthcare and electronic test and measurement. Offset by weakness across automation and memory test, these fourth quarter application trends were consistent throughout 2019 and for the full year industrial revenue decreased 2%. Our industrial results highlight the benefits of having a diverse product portfolio and tens of thousands of customers across many applications. Communications, which represented 18% of revenue in the fourth quarter was down 19% year-over-year with both wireless and wired down double-digits.For the full-year, comm's [Phonetic] [00:23:00] revenue was up double digits, driven by a notable pickup in 5G-related revenue. As we have mentioned the comm's market is inherently lumpy and we believe this softness is largely timing based. We are at the early stages of the Global 5G rollout, and we remain confident in our expectation that our comm's revenue will grow in 2020 and beyond, given our market leading position and higher content opportunity in 5G.Automotive, which represented 16% of revenue in the fourth quarter was down 8%, while BMS continues to be a bright spot, growing double-digits. We did face are headwinds, which impacted our other application areas. For the full year auto revenue declined 6% in line with the decline in vehicle sales. And in total fourth quarter revenue from our B2B markets decreased 6% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, full year B2B revenue increased slightly. Consumer, which represented 15% of revenue in the quarter was down 7% and our performance for the full year was down 16% in line with our outlook.Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, gross margin was 68.4%, a decrease of 200 basis points sequentially. Approximately 140 basis points of this decline was related to a one-time inventory charge associated with a customer within our communications market. Opex was $427 million, a decrease of more than 5% year-over-year and sequentially opex was down 2%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of opex decline due to our disciplined and discretionary spend and lower variable comp. Operating margins were approximately 39%, excluding the one-time charge, operating margins were above 40%.Interest and other expenses were down $6 million year-over-year as we continue to focus on reducing debt. Our tax rate was 13%, which came in that the lower end of our guide and all told adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.19 or $1.24, excluding the one-time inventory charge.Now moving on to the balance sheet. Sequentially inventory dollars decreased $28 million and days declined by five, to 124. As a reminder, our target for inventory days is 115 to 125, but as we have communicated in the past ADI is currently in the process of closing two legacy LTC facilities. During this transition, we plan to carry an additional 5 to 10 days a bridge inventory to support our customers. Channel inventory ended the quarter at 8.5 weeks, above our seven to eight week range. For the fourth quarter, our sell-in revenue was below sell through. Fourth quarter capex was $51 million and for the year was $275 million or approximately 5% of revenue. Looking to 2020, we are forecasting capex to be slightly below 4%.And now on to the first quarter outlook for 2020. In our seasonally weaker first quarter, revenue is expected to be $1.3 billion plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to decrease mid teens year-over-year and there are few items factored into this outlook.First, we are planning to meaningfully reduce channel inventory in the first quarter and return to our target range of seven to eight weeks by the end of the second quarter. Next, we expect 5G demand to remain modest through the end of this calendar year with a positive inflection and demand to occur in the fiscal second quarter, as the global 5G rollout ramps. And lastly, in fiscal 2020 the Chinese New Year falls in the last week of our first quarter. So during this time, there is a minimal activity across our Chinese distributors.So turning to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter, Op margin is expected to be approximately 36.7% at the midpoint, mainly due to lower revenue and lower utilization. Our non-op expenses are expected to be approximately $49 million and for fiscal 2020 we are reducing the low end of our long-term tax rate and guiding 12% to 15%. Based on these input first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be a $1 plus or minus $0.07. As Vince stated one of our priorities is the efficient use of capital, and I want to highlight the actions we are taking related to this effort in the current environment.The first action is preserving working capital by managing inventory, both on our balance sheet and in the channel. In the fourth quarter, we reduced factory utilization and plan to do so again in the first quarter. To put this in context, our current factory utilization is at levels consistent with prior cycle troughs. The second action is restructuring, in line with our disciplined approach to managing cost and operational efficiency. In the fourth quarter, we executed a restructuring and realignment of our business. This restructuring combined with the previously announced LTC facility closures will result in a $135 million of total cost savings over the next two years.As we exit 2020, we expect to realize approximately $50 million of savings with around 75% coming from opex and the balance from cost of goods sold. These cost reductions will begin in the first half. And in 2021 after the facilities are closed, we expect to realize the remaining $85 million of savings in cost of goods sold. Together these position us to drive operating margins toward the high end of our long-term operating model over time.And the third action is continuing to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders after debt payments. In 2020, we plan on paying down between $300 million to $500 million of debt. We expect to return all remaining free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.So in summary, the external environment will continue to present headwinds, at least in the near term. However as Vince noted, we are seeing early indications of improving conditions beginning in the second quarter. And with that let me turn it back over to Mike to lead our Q&A. -- Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's go to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we'll give an opportunity for a follow-up. Operator, can we have the first question please.[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Good morning Vivek. -- Hi, yes, this is Jamie Zachlich [Phonetic] on for Vivek. -- Good morning Jamie. -- My first question is on gross margins. I know you mentioned that one-time inventory charge, but going forward, how should we think about the sensitivity of gross margins to sales and mix and is there something else that could impact those? Thanks. -- Great, thank you for the question, Jamie. So first, let me start by reiterating our model. 70% is our long-term model and as you saw in the good times we were operating above that closer to 72% plus and in these last two quarters or last quarter, in the current quarter with some of the revenue compression, we're in the high 80's, so through a cycle we're still going to see 70.But the way I kind of guide you to think about it is, there are two factors, utilization and mix. Mix doesn't change and given kind of where the outlook is industrial is going to be above 50%. We have lower utilizations in the first quarter, and this is going to impact the first quarter margins and bring it down to that 70%. The first quarter does not have the reserve headwind, but it does have the lower utilization. So on a go-forward basis, what happens is really going to be macro dependent -- as volume comes back, we will have a pretty significant leverage from where we are and then on top of that I just mentioned, the additional cost reduction actions that we're taking, a $100 million in cost synergies exiting 2021 and roughly kind of $15 million of that will come in by the end of this year.Do you have a follow-up question Jamie? -- Yeah. Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the 5G e-com side of things. You guys gave some great color on timing, but I was just wondering if there was any specific geography or area that was weaker on comm's the 5G side or if it was more broad based? Thank you. -- Yeah, Jamie, the downturn of -- the short-term downturn here in 5G was broad based. It was all regions and all customers. -- Thank you. -- We will do our next caller question.Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Yes, thank you and congratulations on managing through this environment. So first question, if we look at revenues down 15% year-over-year for the January quarter. How would you qualify that between a, seasonality; B, lowering channel inventory; and c, weaker end demand. Just trying to understand, between those three what's driving the down 15%? -- Yes, thanks for the question. So first, the outlook is mid-teens and B2B and in that sense on a year-over-year basis, I would say industrial did a bit better than mid teens, maybe down about say 10% or so year-over-year. That implies, I would say worst in seasonal sequential growth, part of that is demand, part of that also reducing the channel.Automotive, it's right around that mid-teens percent down year-over-year and comms was down a bunch more than mid-teens and down sequentially as well. On consumers, the math on that implies about 20% or so down year-over-year. -- Tore, as a rough estimate, I'd say that if you took the combination of what we're doing in the channel plus the impact of Chinese New Year roughly like a $50-ish million impact on a -- on a revenue impact to kind of how we're guiding the outlook. -- Do you have a follow-up, Tore. -- Yeah, thank you. That was really helpful. So follow-up for Vince. Vince, you talked about connectivity now for BMS and including wireless, I assume that is based on your proprietary wireless technology. If not, maybe you could elaborate a little bit on that please? -- Yeah, thanks for the question Tore. Yeah, so we've got the highest precision battery management the sensing and measurement portfolio. Note to that we are beginning to sample this wireless technology. It's a proprietary, rugged, robust, [Indecipherable] feeling radio technology and so yes, it is proprietary, based on proprietary ADI hardware as well as software stack. -- Great, thank you very much. -- Thank you,Tore. To our next question.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hi, thank you very much. Good morning, guys. I had a question on distribution inventory and -- I'm just confused in the why the difference between the disty work down, the channel work down that your analog as well as broader diversified guys have seen vs your channel inventory went up the last quarter. And so, you're taking the action now, but just wanted to understand why the difference in timing Vince. -- Yeah. So Ambrish, remember that we manage the business on a sell through basis. We're reporting revenue on a sell-in basis and over the course of 2019, our sell-in was roughly equivalent to sell through. But as we've seen revenue come down toward the later part of 2019, the levels in the channel, have gotten outside of our preferred range of seven to eight. So we're taking specific action, we began in Q4, will continue in Q1 with a goal that by the end of Q2, we will get channel inventory kind of back in that seven to eight week range. The result is that we're going to be putting less into the channel and the channel is selling out and the answer I gave to Jamie earlier is -- is that -- Tore earlier is that roughly -- if you include that plus the Chinese New Year impact, which is at the end of our fiscal first quarter is at a rough estimate kind of $50-ish million worth of revenue impact. -- Ambrish, I'll also add one thing that Vince and Prashant noted in their script. Our industrial business was only down about 2% last year, which I think versus the market it was very -- performed very well. So there's always timing with all the different things, but on a performance basis, we outperformed in '18 and again in '19. Do you have a follow-up Ambrish? -- Yeah I did. And this was with -- with respect to the writedown, typically in the analog world, inventory writedown usually then results in a tailwind down the road, but I was wondering are we seeing something different here and I'm assuming, it could be a wrong assumption that this is related to Huawei. So does that come back and are you able to sell that inventory or are we looking at -- we always think of Analog as company with deep moats, which I'm sure you do. But are we seeing a change at Huawei that they are also developing analog parts that go into their infrastructure? -- Yeah, let me take the first part of that and I'm going to recap what I said in the prepared comments. We took a $20 million inventory reserve related to a one-time charge for a customer in the comms market. We were building to one forecast and then the demand changed pretty rapidly after they were added to the BIS entity list restriction. So it was -- our determination that it was the prudent thing to do and absent another law change, we believe we have minimal to no more inventory exposure for this customer going forward. Is it possible to sell some of that inventory? It's possible, but obviously not probable given that we didn't take the reserve. -- Yeah. So I think the second part of your question there was regarding potential competition there in China. So I think it's not a surprise that Chinese customers are going to look for security of supply. They're going to look for alternate sources, but there is nothing to suggest that we're losing designs anywhere. And as you said the analog market naturally has deep and wide competitive moats given the complexity of the technology, the diversity that's required to be a stable long-term supplier into those markets and of course the lifecycles as well are very, very long. So I guess the way to look at it, the threat from local suppliers in China. Well, it really isn't anything new, but you know there is a lot of other facets of -- that required just beyond the product, the the quality levels we ship are in the parts per billion.You know the support required is very, very sophisticated, very, very complex. And I think the asymmetry between the skill sets and talents that we have as an analog supplier compared to anybody else, that asymmetry is pushing more and more toward ADI. So the gap between the skills that we have and many others that gap is growing. So I think to just finish up my commentary here on China, it has been and will continue to be an important market and we expect to be doing thriving business there in the years ahead for many, many, many decades. -- Thank you, Vince. Good luck, guys. -- Thanks Ambrish. -- Thanks Ambrish. -- Thanks Ambrish. Next question please.Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi guys, thanks for taking the question and I apologize for any background noise. Vince and Prashanth, I think you both talked about the potential recovery in demand starting in the fiscal second quarter. Is that -- was that a comment specific to comms or was it more broad-based? And I guess more importantly what gives you the confidence to make those comments. given the uncertainty, both from a macro and trade standpoint? Thank you. -- Okay. I'd like to start on that, Vince, anything you want to add? -- Yeah. -- So there is some macro and some kind of specific to ADI. So from a macro level, it's our -- it's our take that we're kind of bouncing along the bottom, certainly there is ongoing uncertainty with the trade war that's impacting overall demand and customers are putting a pause on capex spend. It is weaker than a year ago, but it seems to be stabilizing at this level. For comms in 5G, there is a lull between deployments. As I said in the prepared remarks comms is inherently lumpy. It's very early days on the 5G and we are -- we're expecting demand to kind of stay soft through the end of this calendar year, but pick up nicely for 2020 and as I mentioned in the remarks, we're expecting comms to grow year-over-year in 2020. Specific to ADI, we've got a couple of things that are impacting our first quarter. So as I had mentioned I think, we had a couple of questions on this now. We are proactively reducing inventory in the channel and then on top of that the Chinese New Year, which is normally a non-event, if it falls in the middle of a quarter, this time it's falling at the end of our fiscal first quarter. -- Yeah, I think the only other thing I'd add to what Prashanth has said is that, you know, typically our first quarter is weaker than our second. There is a seasonality to that, particularly in the industrial and the automotive businesses and that's how we see things shaping up at this point in time. And as Prashanth to said, we're confident that 5G demand is really poised to ramp at the beginning of our second quarter. So I think that's the summary of demand here for you. -- Thanks, Toshiya. Do you a follow-up? -- I do. Thank you. And then Prashanth, you talked about $135 million in cost reductions over the next -- I suppose, two years. How should we think about that number of kind of sticking to the P&L. In other words, should we expect a pretty high percentage drop through to margins or should we expect you guys to reinvest some of those savings in your high priority areas? Thank you. -- Thanks Toshiya. Let me -- let me break -- let me break that break that down again. So we had talked about $100 million of cost savings, when we closed down the two facilities. And then in addition to that we made some -- we took some actions in the fourth quarter to generate an additional $35 million. So those actions are in process. In 2020, we would expect to exit the year with about $50 million of those savings in the run rate and that would be split between opex and cost of goods sold. We'll have those savings sort of feather in over the course of the year, that is at this point kind of roughly a net number. So that is -- the expectation is we're going to be able to drive most of that down through the -- through the P&L and into the -- into the EPS number. -- Thanks Toshiya. Our next question.Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Great, thanks for taking my question. And I want to address the optimistic April commentary. By my math I think normal seasonality in April is about up three and it sounds like the real recovering end market is comms infrastructure related to 5G. I'm wondering if there is any insight into other end markets and if normal seasonality is up three, do you think we wind up posting meaningfully better than that. Any -- It would seem an outside possibility that we could be up year-over-year in that quarter, but any comments would be helpful? Thank you. -- Thanks William. Also, I'll give you some basis of seasonality. We don't guide outside of a quarter, I would say. We could give you some context around counting a growth market for us in 2020 despite the slow start. Seasonally speaking, industrial in 2Q is up call it 5% to 10% sequentially. Automotive is up also probably call it 5% to 10% maybe sequentially. Both those seasonally are up. We don't visibility into those orders today, but seasonally standpoint, they do. There is some tailwinds to those businesses. And communications, we're talking about a pretty big uptick in 2Q, which helped drive that business to grow for 2020. Do You have follow-up? -- Sure. Any comment as to where we are in the comms and pardon me the consumer end market. We know there was this Force Touch design win that's been sort of fading from the model, you decline this year, maybe an outlook as to the coming year in that end market would be -- would be helpful, both in that sort one charismatic design win and then maybe the core business? Thank you. -- Yeah. So my sense during 2020 is that we will have -- we will have a continuing headwind. It's lasting a little bit longer than we initially thought, but -- so I think 2020, we expect it to be down in the range of 10% to 15% and it relates really to the ongoing mix issue in our portable business. But what I would like to report to is that I believe overall that 2020 will mark the bottom for this business, the diversity of our products across products, across customers and applications is stronger than we've seen actually for several years. And so based on that diversity and the strength of our pipeline and the diversity of our pipeline that gives me the optimism that we're going to get back into a pretty solid growth trajectory I think in the 2021 and beyond period. -- Thanks, Will. Our next question, please.Our next question comes from Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Yes, thank you. Good morning. My questions on the automotive market. And I think your comments were that's it's looking down 6% year-on-year this year in line with industry units. I presume you're still gaining some content there, so is the difference there inventory that's come down and perhaps you could, if that's the case, what's the set up as we go into 2020 has perhaps some of that inventory normalizes? -- Yeah, thanks for the question Chris. Let's do this in two parts. I'll kind of lay out how we're thinking about our order performance in 2019. And then let Vince talk about a bit more on the growth drivers. So as a recap, our fourth quarter was down 8% for the full year and -- our fourth quarter was down 8%. The full year was down 6% year-over-year in line with SAR and we saw that across all applications on the year-over-year decline, except for BMS, which continues to show very strong double-digit growth. As we look to 2020. I'll let Vince kind of talk about the outlook for auto, 2020 and beyond. -- Yeah. So, during the -- during the past year, we've grown our pipeline of designs at across the globe with all the key automotive customers. And I think one of the areas that I'm pleased most pleased about is in our power portfolio, which cuts across all the various sub-application areas, in automotive, I'll give you a couple of examples. We've won an integrated power management solution for a market-leading Tier 1 radar platform, where the key reference design at a market-leading vision camera supplier. And given the strength of our Infotainment business as well in DSP and audio signal processing solutions, we've been able to bring more power management from the LTC portfolio into that particular suite of applications as well.We've talked before about our A2B and our A2B solution. So today that only represents kind of low -- very low single digits of our auto portfolio, but the design pipeline is gaining robustness. At this point in time, we've got design wins at around 14 OEMs and half of them are currently in production. So my sense is that over the next three years, we can double the size of our A2B business and also the other facet of A2B is that the time for this expanding into being able to participate in active noise cancellation of power delivery. Prashanth has touched on the BMS side of things. So that will continue to be, we believe a strong growth driver for the Company probably off again double digits in 2020.And you know on the autonomous vehicle side of things, we're sampling a CMOS based radar solution that doubles the dynamic range against anything else that's out there from our competitors. So I think we have some very, very good innovation drivers in the business as well as the fact that we are bringing the OTC portfolio into many, many new accounts in new geographies. So hopefully that gives you a sense for what's going on in the auto sector. -- Thanks, Chris. Do you have follow-up? -- I do. Thank you. The follow-up question will be on production. You talked about being that cycle trough utilization rates, what would be the plan going forward, if you did see some of these indications of improvements going the second quarter with the plan B to start increasing production at that point? Generally, how are you looking to manage inventory as you go through next year with any understanding that you're going to be keeping some of that bridge inventory for the fab closures? -- Great. Yeah, thanks, Chris. So, yes, so the -- I guess the way to think about it is utilizations are -- comfortable utilizations are at trough levels. So as -- and you can see the impact of that on our gross margins. So, as the demand comes back and revenue improves, then we'll have great leverage from an internal manufacturing and be able to capture that demand with new manufacturing and then in addition to that we mentioned, we're taking the channel down. So there will also be likely some opportunity to provide product into the channel to meet that growth. So we are -- we're setting ourselves up for what we believe is a good trough in Q1 and then will grow from here. -- Great, thank you. -- Thanks Chris. And so, we'll move to our last question please.Thank you. Last question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Yeah, hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Thanks for managing the business extremely well and actually taking actions to get better profitability. I had one on gross margins. So all things put together based on what you've said, we should think about gross margins for the January quarter, take that 140 bps charge that you had, Prashanth Is that a good way to think about it and down maybe 50, 60 basis points? -- I think maybe --maybe you're saying the same thing, Harsh, but we're going -- we're essentially going to swap the inventory charge with the under-utilization. So that's probably how you should think about gross margin for the first quarter, is we don't have the recurring inventory charge, but we do have the headwind from kind of trough factory utilization levels as we kind of bottom out in the first quarter. -- Do you have a follow up Harsh. -- Yeah. Got it. Thank you. Yes, please. And then just real quickly in the auto business next year, do you think with all that's happened this year with the flushing of production and SAR being down mid-to-high sort of 6%, 7%. Do you think we're at a point where we can basically say that automotive for ADI will grow next year on a year-over-year basis? -- Well, it's very, very hard in what has been a very uncertain environment in automotive over the last several quarters. Very, very hard to call. I think if SAR stabilizes, my sense is that we'll have a normal year. And you know for the last five years we've been outgrowing SAR. So my expectation is that if SAR stabilizers given the the length of the product life cycles of our legacy business, as well as the new designs we have that you know the the business should behave normally, we should have growth SAR. So one of the things as well that we've got, I think we've mentioned in the prepared remarks as well is that our power business is poised, given the design wins that we've got across infotainment and safety systems in particular, we expect that during the course of the year here to gain momentum, and starts to show meaningful revenue in the 2021 period. -- Okay. -- Thanks guys. -- Thank you, Harsh. -- Thank you. -- And thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Copy of the transcript will be available on our website. All of our reconciliations and information can also be found there. Have a happy Thanksgiving and thank you again.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

  looked like  at the beginning of the year thanks to a clutch of notable catalysts, an attractive dividend, and . The chipmaker has not disappointed so far, but a few signs of weakness have started emerging.Analog's fiscal third-quarter results (out in August) revealed a slight drop in revenue and margins, which eventually hurt the company's bottom-line performance. Its adjusted earnings per share fell an alarming 17% year over year to $1.26 in the third quarter on the back of a 5% revenue decline. data by With Analog stock having delivered close to 30% gains this year, should investors hit the sell button before things get worse? Let's find out.It is not difficult to see why Analog Devices struggled last quarter. The addition of Huawei to the U.S. government's Entity List meant that it was no longer allowed to ship its products to the Chinese giant. The chipmaker had  that this would hinder its third-quarter performance.The bad news for Analog investors is that its business with Huawei is not as strong as it once was, and the company is unsure of when and if things will get back on track. CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah made this clear in the Q3 :But at least for the near term, our Huawei demand has taken a step down from previous levels. As a result, we are planning for sales to this customer to be meaningfully below our previous mid-single-digit percentage range, which we discussed with you last quarter.The company anticipates $1.45 billion in revenue this quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which represents a 9% decline over its prior-year period revenue.Image source: Getty Images.So top-line erosion is going to be greater this quarter. But the problem is that the Huawei situation alone is not responsible for the slowdown. An uncertain macroeconomic environment and a tense geopolitical climate are posing challenges.The industrial business segment accounts for half of Analog's total revenue. Sales from this segment dropped 4% year over year in the last reported quarter, and they are down 5% in the nine months of the ongoing fiscal year.Analog points out that the aerospace and defense sub-segments within the industrial group are delivering impressive growth. But a slowdown in industrial automation and tepid demand for memory test chips on account of weakness in that industry are weighing on the overall industrial business.The industrial automation market, for instance, is expected to hit a speed bump in 2019. Demand for industrial automation equipment is expected to rise at a slower pace of 3.2% this year as compared with last year's 4.7% growth, according to IHS Markit. This tepid growth can be attributed to a stark reduction in industrial capital-expenditure growth this year, which is expected to increase only 2.2% in 2019 after a strong jump of 7.1% last year.The report points out that businesses are scaling back automation projects, manufacturing output is declining, and real GDP growth is expected to contract in key economies such as the U.S., India, China, and the Eurozone. So the industrial business will probably start turning around when the macroeconomic scenario starts improving.Analog's automotive business is also feeling the heat because of a slowdown in auto sales. The business -- which supplies 15% of the company's revenue -- saw a 9% revenue decline last quarter. The bad news is that it might not turn around anytime soon as major automakers are cutting production.Both  and  are taking steps to curb production as auto sales in the U.S. are down 1.4% through September, according to Edmunds data. And the auto sales decline could accelerate in the coming years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch senior auto analyst John Murphy. He forecasts that U.S. auto sales could drop 30% by 2022.The end-market trends indicate that Analog Devices could be in for tough times. Moreover, the stock seems fairly valued right now with a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 29, which is right in line with its five-year average trailing P/E multiple.Thanks to the near-term headwinds, there might be an opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a much cheaper valuation in the future if the price tumbles. So it might be a good idea for Analog Devices investors to book profits in the current scenario and wait for concrete signs of a turnaround before going long once again.

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options begin trading this week, for the October 18th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new October 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $108.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.65.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $108.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $106.35 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $109.06/share today.

Because the $108.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.53% return on the cash commitment, or 69.70% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $108.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $109.06/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.33% if the stock gets called away at the October 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.47% boost of extra return to the investor, or 66.94% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 34%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 33%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $109.06) to be 32%.

"y Tim BeyersNowadays, almost anything can connect to the internet. From light bulbs and traffic lights to cars, TVs, refrigerators, sensor-pocked oil pipelines and the smart speaker in your home, it's become difficult to walk 20 feet without bumping into the Internet of Things (IoT).Size and scale makes  complicated. Too many companies do  to make the IoT what it is, and yet buying every stock with an IoT story isn't an option for most investors. What to do? The simplest and potentially safest route could be to invest in the biggest IoT stocks --  companies with well-defined IoT business units that will grow as the movement grows.Before we dig into the businesses behind the 10 biggest IoT stocks, it's worth spending a couple of minutes to provide a bit more detail on the two different layers of the Internet of Things: the consumer IoT and the industrial IoT.Most IoT companies serve both consumers and industrial customers in some way. Amazon, for example, has the in-home Alexa smart speaker technology (consumer) and Greengrass software for helping process sensor data without a cloud connection (industrial).It's worth paying attention to the distinctions, because the opportunities are different. Consumer IoT is the fastest-growing segment, while industrial IoT is the biggest segment, researcher IDC . By 2022, combined spending on consumer and industrial IoT technology and services is expected to cross $1 trillion for the first time — and keep growing in the years to come.Which stocks are profiting from the dramatic rise in IoT spending? Are they worth adding to your portfolio? Let's tackle those questions for each of the 10 biggest IoT stocks by first examining their offering, and then reviewing their financials, competitive position, and the durability of their competitive edge. Here's the 10 biggest, ordered by largest to smallest market cap:DATA SOURCE: S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE. You may notice that three of the world's largest companies —  ,  , and   — aren't listed, yet all have substantial IoT operations. Why not include them? Put simply, IoT is a minor add-on for these companies – features of broad public cloud offerings that do much more than buttress the IoT operations of their customers.That said, the Big Three have plenty to offer when it comes to IoT support. Take Microsoft, which offers a handful of tailored IoT products tied to its Azure public cloud platform. Most of Microsoft's products are built to help customers grow their investment in IoT without adding physical infrastructure for supporting new devices. But it doesn't end there. The company also bundles together sophisticated hardware and services to secure the equipment that shepherds IoT data across geographies. Amazon and Alphabet have similar solutions.Amazon, for example, has tools for connecting and operating devices at the ""edge"" of the internet. Also referred to as an endpoint, the edge is where you'll find internet-connected devices — from smart speakers such as Alexa to sensors on oil platforms. Amazon's AWS IoT Greengrass is built to allow industrial devices to process data independently from the cloud, like the pressure sensor array connected to an oil drill pushing into the depths of the the Gulf of Mexico.Alphabet's Google Cloud is similarly broad in how it provides support for the Internet of Things. The company bills its Cloud IoT Core as a ""fully managed service"" for gathering, processing, analyzing, and ultimately visualizing data from a customer's IoT deployment. Cloud IoT Core is also capable of orchestrating updates to every device on an IoT network.At a high level, it's best to think of the cloud as an enabling technology for IoT instead of part of the IoT. That's why we didn't include Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft on our list of the biggest IoT stocks to own.As the world's largest and most diversified chipmaker, Intel serves both the consumer IoT and the industrial IoT. Company marketing materials show seven areas where Intel offers IoT products and services, including:Other IoT solutions from Intel provide more intelligent and immersive classroom experiences, automate factories, improve patient care, and put the smarts in smart, connected vehicles.Financially, Intel is a slower-growth business with roots in the global PC business. To this day, it remains subject to the fits and starts of the global economic cycle. Revenue is up just 5.5% annually over the five years dating back to 2015, while cash flow from operations has improved 6.4% annually over the same period. Yet those figures belie how much revenue and free cash flow Intel generates on an annual basis — usually over $50 billion and $10 billion, respectively.Competitively, Intel has the brand and resources to deliver IoT solutions at scale. According to its website, Intel has 15 wafer fabrication facilities around the globe, including four in the United States. These ""fabs,"" as they're called, is where Intel manufactures thousands of IoT-ready chips from in-house designs.While the Internet of Things is still a modest portion of Intel's overall business, it's growing quickly. Operating profit from the Internet of Things Group shot up 50.7% in 2018 on a 9% increase in segment revenue. That's serious leverage Intel can continue to exploit in the years to come. In the meantime, a historically generous dividend yield — usually above 2% — makes buying to hold for the long term all the more rewarding.Data networking is the glue that holds together a connected world. Cisco is the world's largest data networking company, and a key player in enabling the industrial IoT. The company offers four specific products in this area:Cisco has plenty of time to let the strategy for these products play out in the market. You have to go back a decade for the last time the company generated less than $10 billion in cash from operations. In exactly none of those 10 years did Cisco ever spend more than $1.5 billion on capital expenditures. To this day, the company is flush billions of dollars in excess cash to acquire and deploy new technology to serve customers with IoT ambitions.For years Cisco has faced upstart threats to its data networking business and has used its cash to acquire the most serious. The next 5-10 years shouldn't be any different, especially with the company throwing off so much excess cash flow. Expect Cisco to keep making deals and expanding its lineup of IoT products and platforms. While some may know Honeywell for smoke alarms and other household musts, the company is putting plenty of marketing muscle into its signature suite: ""IIoT by Honeywell.""Say what you want about the name but the product appears to check all the boxes: connect sensors to the cloud, provide detailed analytics on the resulting data, automated systems that trigger alerts when problem patterns emerge. Honeywell also claims the customers of its platform are more likely to get maximum use of industrial assets and use data to optimize performance.Whether or not you believe the platitudes there's no disputing the numbers. According to S&P  Intelligence, Honeywell has produced over $4 billion in free cash flow every year from 2015 through 2018 . So while there may be others on this list with proven industrial technology it appears .Does that make the stock a buy? Not necessarily. Honeywell tends to trade at a slight premium to its competitors in the industrial conglomerates segment, according to data from S&P  Intelligence. That's a less-than-ideal price for a company whose history includes slow and declining revenue growth.IBM shows a Smarter Planet exhibit at Disney's Epcot. Image source: IBMBig Blue bears significant responsibility for the popularity of the IoT. In November 2008, at the apex of the financial crisis, IBM's then-CEO and Chairman Sam Palmisano gave a speech to the Council of Foreign Relations laying out a vision for a Smarter Planet. From a retrospective posted at the IBM website:In his speech, Palmisano painted a picture of a world made up of a trillion connected and intelligent things, and the oceans of data they produce.Smarter Planet became IBM's first commercial foray into IoT. Today, Big Blue uses the Watson artificial intelligence engine to make more of the data piping through cities, cars, factories, and more. It's a scaled-up business with, as the company calls them, ""solutions"" for:And like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, IBM has Watson in the cloud for organizations to connect their IoT systems and analyze data at scale. Overall, IBM is battling Google for third place in the public cloud market and is relying on its $34 billion purchase of Red Hat to further bolster its efforts to get customers to trust it with large-scale projects.Financially, Big Blue has spent years struggling to find new sources of growth. Revenue declined annually each year from 2014 to 2018. Gross margin has also contracted during that time, as has cash flow from operations. (Down 1.4% annually over the last five years.)The good news? Watson appears to be the most mature of the nascent A.I. platforms and a potentially ideal system for managing IoT projects at scale. Mix in Red Hat's proven appeal with software developers and Big Blue's long history of providing IT services to the world's biggest companies, and it's possible IBM nets the largest share of dollars spent on industrial IoT projects over the next five years.That's a potentially appealing position for buy-to-hold investors, made more so when you realize that IBM has a history of paying out close to a third of its annual cash from operations (CFFO) as dividends. Big Blue tends to generate at least $15 billion in annual CFFO and at least $12 billion in free cash flow.Sensors and connectors are the glue that allows IoT data to flow between and through connected devices. QUALCOMM is in the business of making those connections with wireless technology. The company is focusing efforts in four areas:In virtually all these projects, QUALCOMM is selling its chip designs and and other ""SoC"" — or, ""system on a chip"" — platforms upon which partners build products for use. It's an old model that's served QUALCOMM well over the years. In fact, the company's original innovations in mixed-signal wireless CDMA chips annually accounts for over $5 billion in licensing and royalty payments from QUALCOMM partners.Whether the company finds the same licensing opportunities in the IoT is an open question at this point, as is . Questions linger over the legality of QUALCOMM's pricing strategy with respect to licensing as competition heats up in the greener fields of its business — notably, chips to support the connectivity needs of the IoT. Last year QUALCOMM pledged $44 billion to acquire IoT peer  to improve its positioning in the space but .So how does QUALCOMM fare on its own? Both revenue and cash flow growth have been woefully inconsistent over the last five years. For now, there's no reason to believe we'll see a change in the status quo anytime soon.Whereas QUALCOMM specializes in the wireless connections that form the backbone of the IoT, Analog Devices makes many of the ""things"" that form the Internet of Things. From sensors and converters to transceivers and processing systems, Analog Devices' products exist at the industrial edge of the industrial IoT.Think of Analog Devices as the front line of the industrial IoT, where small single-purpose machines take measurements, sense changes, and report anomalies in the integrity of the network. Most of these basic systems capture data in a raw form to be converted into digital signals — 1s and 0s, essentially — that are readable by computers in the cloud.You might expect that with the rise of a more connected world with the IoT at its core, Analog Devices' positioning would make it essential for the era in which we live. And you'd be right. Over the five years from 2013 to 2018 Analog Devices has improved revenue and cash from operations by 17.3% and 21% annualized, respectively. The company has also grown its dividend per share by over 7% annualized over the same period, adding a 100%-plus return in the share price. More market-beating gains should follow, presuming the company's position as a premier supplier of the sensors and converters that comprise the front line of the IoT remains largely intact. Like the other industrial conglomerates on this list, Emerson Electric is jockeying to get as much revenue and profit as it can from providing technology that makes the industrial IoT more functional. The company's Plantweb digital ecosystem is its top-billed IoT offering for collecting, analyzing, and preserving the data that describes the physical health and performance of factory assets.It's a good story, but it's also  such as oil and gas drillers to be spending on exploration. That's a hit-and-sometimes-miss position to be in, which makes Emerson more of a cyclical business than a steady performer. (Total revenue is down 5.7% annually over the five years ended on June 30, 2019.)Cash spent on acquisitions is a key part of the long-term story, and so far the news isn't good. Emerson spent $2.9 billion cash on acquisitions in 2017 and then $2.2 billion the next year. Adding the $1.2 billion-plus Emerson pays in annual dividends plus another $600 million to $700 million in capex eats all of the company's cash flow from operations — and then some — which means there may not be enough for Emerson to sustainably pay a 3%-plus dividend.If you work in an office building in any city in the U.S. — or anywhere around the world, for that matter — Johnson Controls may be helping to keep the lights on, the office cool (or warm in the winter), all while monitoring for security breaches and energy inefficiency. Basically, Johnson Controls wants to give your office building a brain.It's an interesting but old idea. Building management systems have been around since the commercial adoption of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, which were invented in the early 1900s. Today's building management systems leverage the IoT for the same reasons factories and oil platforms do: to monitor systems to maximize their useful life and to automate any process that can be automated. Shutting off lights when motion sensors no longer detect movement in a section of the building, for example.Johnson Controls provides a full range of industrial HVAC equipment that's cloud-connectable plus building management software for monitoring the health of the systems built to keep workers safe, comfortable, and productive. That's a $30 billion-plus business as of this writing, but Johnson Controls used to be bigger. In 2018 the company sold its battery making division, Power Solutions, for $11.4 billion in net consideration.The company has significantly strengthened its balance sheet since the sale, paying off over $3 billion in debt while adding nearly $3.5 billion in cash. JCI also appears on track to sustainably produce over $1 billion in annual free cash flow, enough to fund its dividend payments and make this stock a potentially attractive long-term hold for the first time in years.The Internet of Things is constantly changing and shifting — and, moving. NXP Semiconductors creates ""endpoints"" for intelligently tracking data from the systems in the IoT. Smart automobiles are a particular specialty but the company also has broader ambitions to . NXP's microcontrollers, power management chips, radio frequency ID chips, sensors and more can be made to support smarter cities and smarter factories as well as smarter cars. To that end, NXP has a Rapid IoT Prototyping Kit to help designers and developers bring intelligence to any device that can be networked.NXP's strategy has drawn significant interest, . The bad news? Good strategy hasn't always translated to good financial results. Revenue has grown just 12.3% annually over the past five years, a sharp deceleration from where the company was in 2016. Fortunately the company is more streamlined and is generating over $3 billion in free cash flow, a positive trend that should allow NXP to strengthen its balance sheet and reinvest in its IoT products.In the meantime, the stock is trading for historically low multiples to sales and projected earnings as of this writing. Even modest improvements in NXP's IoT business over the next few years would add meaningfully to profits and cash flow and drive the stock higher.For over a century, Rockwell Automation has been providing the foundational infrastructure of industry. Today that includes the ThingWorx IoT platform for visually connecting devices, data sources, and applications to automate processes across plant facilities. Sound good? There's one catch: engineers at Rockwell partner   are the brains behind ThingWorx. So it should be no surprise that in June of 2018 Rockwell announced plans to invest $1 billion in PTC equity. The company held roughly 9.2% of PTC's shares outstanding as of this writing.Rockwell needs the help. After two years of declines, revenue grew 7% in fiscal 2017 only to to 5.6% in fiscal 2018 and just 1.4% in the trailing 12 months ended on June 30, 2019. Rockwell's once cash-rich balance sheet deteriorated over the same period and is saddled with just over $1.3 billion in net debt (i.e., the remaining debt after subtracting excess cash) as of this writing. Rockwell needs industrial IoT projects to be a catalyst for its business. The Internet of Things is complicated. Billions of sensors and transceivers built into lights, HVAC systems, pipelines, and generators make cities, factories, and workplaces smarter while voice-activated speakers and smart-sensing cameras enhance how consumers experience the world while using the cloud to connect to our digital personas. We've never been more interconnected. That's both a plus and a minus for investors.Because the IoT weaves together the fabric of our lives -- the homes where we live, the buildings where we work, the cars we drive, and so much more -- it's likely we'll see increasing government oversight of everything connected to the internet. When -- not if -- regulation comes, it'll makes headlines in major news outlets so you won't have to look far to find out what's at stake. Just don't panic! All tech-driven industries are subject to increased regulation at some point. Think of  finally submitting to adding state sales taxes on purchases after years of claiming the internet made it exempt. The new rules did little to slow the company's march toward dominance and today it remains the world's top e-commerce brand.How can we profit from this movement as investors? Any of these three options could serve you well, depending on your ability to endure some losses for the promise of long-term market crushing gains:I prefer the third option, and Intel is my choice as one of the . The company is an established position leader in data center processors, and we're going to keep needing more powerful data centers to manage IoT sprawl around the globe. Intel is well-positioned to beat the market over the next five years. Whatever path you choose for , commit to at least five years of holding fast. The IoT is a long-term trend. Profiting from it requires the discipline to buy to own for years.

"illiam von Mueffling has long been regarded as one of the world's leading fund managers, and since his Cantillon Capital Management currently holds only 33 stocks, it's worth keeping a close eye on what the fund has been buying and selling.Digging into the latest 13F filing at the SEC shows three significant purchases in very contrasting companies. Let's look at all three -- semiconductor materials company  , marine boat and engine company  , and life sciences and diagnostics technology company .Not only do the three operate in vastly different end markets, but they also offer significantly different investment propositions. Brunswick is ,  refocusing on its core marine business following the sale of its commercial fitness equipment business, called Life Fitness, to a private equity firm in June.Relax and let the world's best investors do the work for you. Image source: Getty Images.Agilent has solid defensive growth characteristics and might suit risk-averse investors looking for a combination of mid-single-digit growth and some security in an economic downturn. Meanwhile, Entegris operates in a cyclical industry, semiconductors, whereby revenue and earnings can fluctuate significantly from period to period.Data sources: analyst estimates, Yahoo! finance.The life sciences and diagnostics company is  the easiest investment to understand, as Cantillon is also holding stock in relatively defensive names like , animal health company , and Agilent's direct competitor . Agilent belongs in a stable of blue-chip life sciences and diagnostics companies that also includes  , , , and Thermo Fisher, which offer relatively safe mid-single-digit annual growth prospects. As such, investors have warmed to the sector in the past year, as it offers security in an environment of slowing global growth -- particularly as it doesn't appear to be a battleground area in the trade conflict with China.Agilent is currently toward the low end of its peer group valuations, and Cantillon may have bought it on a relative valuation basis. data by That said, Danaher is arguably the most attractive company in the sector, not least because of its transformative deal to buy 's biopharma business -- a deal on a very attractive valuation, and one that should be complimentary to Danaher's own life sciences solutions.The sale of the Life Fitness business in the summer has created a marine-focused company with three related revenue streams -- boats, marine engines, and parts and accessories, each contributing roughly a third of total revenue.  It's a marketplace that has traditionally been seen as tied to the housing market, and it's no coincidence that U.S. new boat sales last peaked in 2006 -- just before the housing market slump set in -- but there has been a slow and gradual recovery since then.Moreover, management argues that its revenue is now a lot less cyclically exposed than in 2017, with some 35% coming from engine parts and accessories and around 60% coming from outboard engines and boats, compared with around 15% and 25% in 2007. That's good news for long-term investors. Management expects to generate $4.15 in EPS in 2019 and $5-$5.50 in 2020, in line with analyst forecasts, with around $260 million in free cash flow in 2019 and $300 million to $350 million in 2020.  Such figures put the company on very attractive valuations, but the question for long-term investors is whether the recreational boat market in the U.S. is set for the kind of long-term growth Brunswick needs to sell its outboard engines and boats. If it is, then Cantillon's purchase looks like a good stock purchase.A developer and manufacturer of materials for use in semiconductor manufacturing, Entegris is always going to be tied to the cyclical nature of the industry. Long-term growth trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ever-increasing need for more powerful and efficient semiconductors is seen as benefiting Entegris' solutions, which aid advanced manufacturing processes.Cantillon's purchase clearly represents the expansion of an investment theme, as it also holds semiconductor manufacturers ,  -- a major Entegris customer representing 10% of 2018 sales -- and . Entegris' other major customer is , representing 11% of 2018 sales. Together, these stocks make up around 10% of Cantillon's holdings. It's an interesting idea because the semiconductor industry has been hit in 2019, partly as a consequence of declining smartphone sales and the fallout of the trade war on manufacturing in Asia. Entegris' revenue declined 1% in its recent third quarter. However, there are some positive green shoots emerging. For example,  CEO Mike Roman spoke of ""early indications that [the semiconductor industry] is looking like it might start to improve"" and added that there have been ""some consumer electronics, [original equipment manufacturers], and brands that have talked about increasing sales.""If that's borne out in a pickup in semiconductor capital spending, then von Mueffling's investment in Entegris will prove to be a wise investment.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

 (NASDAQ: TXN) stock has risen from about $69 in August 2016 to around $120 in August 2019. The rise was primarily driven by a steady growth in revenues and net income margins, accompanied by a drop in shares outstanding, and a slightly higher P/E multiple. We expect growth to stagnate in 2019, due to lower consumer electronics demand and trade tensions. However, the advent of 5G could help somewhat offset this cooling demand.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: XSD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $96.34 per unit.


With XSD trading at a recent price near $87.47 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.14% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of XSD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Ceva Inc (Symbol: CEVA), Impinj Inc (Symbol: PI), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although CEVA has traded at a recent price of $27.94/share, the average analyst target is 19.54% higher at $33.40/share. Similarly, PI has 18.47% upside from the recent share price of $30.81 if the average analyst target price of $36.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $119.78/share, which is 12.87% above the recent price of $106.13. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CEVA, PI, and ADI:  

   Combined, CEVA, PI, and ADI represent 5.31% of the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Revenue from the segment was up 31% year over year, providing nearly a quarter of the company's total revenue. A year ago, the communications segment was supplying just 18%.Management pointed to that massive surge in communications revenue as the key driver of its impressive second-quarter performance, noting that the results reflect ""ADI's higher content and share in 5G."" CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah added that Analog's 5G opportunity is still in its early stages, suggesting that the communications business has a lot of room to grow.It is not surprising that Analog is bullish about 5G, because it sees four times the content opportunity for its technology in those new networks as compared to 4G networks. That's because Analog's solutions will help carriers and data centers to boost data speeds while keeping operating costs in check.The rollout of 5G networks will lead to an increase in data transfer speeds, create the need for more storage in data centers, and also lead to higher power consumption. As CEO Vincent Roche said on the latest :By partnering closely with our customers, we're developing highly optimized optical control and power management products that match the smaller form factor required in next-generation optical systems. Importantly, for every 4X increase in speed in an existing network, our control content opportunity increases by more than a third.The company believes that it can tackle this problem through its 5G-specific radio frequency solutions, which will reduce the complexity of design in next-generation networks. This will allow Analog's customers to reduce power consumption and hold costs down, as cooling and power account for 30% of a data center's total ownership cost.In short, investors can expect Analog Devices' communications business to get better in the coming quarters and years as the 5G rollout accelerates.Analog Devices' warning that its business will take a hit due to the sanctions on Huawei shouldn't be a deal-breaker for investors. As Mahendra-Rajah pointed out on the latest conference call, ""our largest communication customers only represented mid-single digits or less as a percentage of total ADI sales.""Bloomberg estimates that Huawei accounted for just 3.3% of Analog Devices' total sales. As such, it shouldn't be difficult for the company to absorb the hit delivered by the Trump administration's ban on sales to Huawei as the 5G catalyst gains traction. Moreover, Trump has suggested that some companies could get temporary exemptions to the ban for technology that doesn't present national security concerns. Given that, there's a good chance that Analog will beat its guidance the next time it reports earnings.So there's no reason for Analog Devices shareholders to panic, because the company's opportunities are outpacing the risks it's facing. Investors need only look past the short-term headwinds and focus on its lucrative 5G market.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Chip Stock Could Win Big From 5G@2019-07-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-chip-stock-could-win-big-from-5g-2019-07-26
"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options become available today, for the October 11th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new October 11th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.40.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $101.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $106.34/share today.

Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.24% return on the cash commitment, or 31.10% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $107.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $106.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $107.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.29% if the stock gets called away at the October 11th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $107.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $107.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.67% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.23% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 33%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 32%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $106.34) to be 31%.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2019 , Good morning, and welcome to Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 , which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.I would like to now, introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. -- Thank you, Cheryl and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Mr. Roche and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. Anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q.These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today about ADI's third quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from these prior quarters and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about the non-GAAP measures, are included in today's earnings release.I also want to point out that during the third quarter, we improved our method to more accurately estimate the end-market classifications for shipments to distributors. This has opened to some modest changes to historical end-market revenue breakdown, but did not change our total revenue or EPS. We have posted a quarterly end-market lookback based on this improvement method to our Investor website.Okay. With that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? -- Thanks very much, Mike and good morning to you all. Well, in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment, we executed soundly in our third fiscal quarter and delivered solid results. Revenue of $1.48 billion in the third quarter came in above the midpoint of our guidance. Our B2B markets decreased 3% year-over-year, given the weaker macro conditions and performed well relative to the market. This performance is testament to the diversity of our franchise and investing ahead of secular trends to drive ongoing share gains and some expansion.Operating margins of approximately 41% were above our guidance, as we moved quickly to reduce expenses, given the ongoing market weakness. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.26. Over the past 12 months, we've generated approximately $2 billion in free cash flow or 33% of revenue. And during the same time period, we have returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments.Now while there are clearly a number of near-term external challenges we are navigating through, ADI has always been and remains focused on delivering sustainable long-term profitable growth. To that end, before Prashanth covers our financial results in more detail, I'm going to continue our quarterly practice of providing a deeper level of insight into one of our markets, the trends influencing its future and how we are positioned to capitalize on these trends over the long term.So today, I'd like to discuss the emerging automotive electrification ecosystem that are supporting a number of underlying industries from energy to transportation to manufacturing, and indeed beyond, and paving the way for the transition to cleaner energy sources. ADI has always been focused on making the most efficient use of energy in both our products and operations, and I'm proud to say that we are playing an important role in this new wave of electrification.We approach automotive electrification from an ecosystem perspective, that is to say the electric vehicle is just one element. For ADI, the origin of our journey starts with the formation of the battery if that extends to the ongoing management of an installed electric vehicles battery system, and then to powering the supporting electrical infrastructure needed to few EVs. The common thread woven through all of these applications is the precision signal processing control and power management capabilities they require, capabilities indeed, in which ADI excels. So let me explain a bit more.Our value journey starts with battery formation and test, a time-consuming and complex chemical process where extremely precise measurement means the difference between a safe, high-quality battery and the low quality one. The lithium ion batteries that power electric vehicles represent nearly a third of the entire cost of the vehicle. So OEMs place a high premium on battery quality and reliability.Our portfolio of fully integrated precision signal processing, control and power products, allows ADI to offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, safety and reliability for their battery formation and test process. Our solutions reduce battery formation costs by two-thirds, by shrinking our customer's equipment footprint by 4 times and enabling up to 95% power reuse, which reduces environmental impact as well. Once the battery system has been manufactured, our opportunity grows with the electrification applications within the vehicle itself. Here our technology is a key enabler in the transition from combustion engines to cleaner electric vehicles, which are projected to grow from the current 2% worldwide vehicle sales to more than 20% over the next decade or so.In the vehicle, the Battery Management System or BMS provides precise monitoring and control of the complex charge and discharge cycles of the battery system. Accuracy and safety in the BMS are critical, since overcharging or undercharging can lead to the battery's destruction and render it useless. The accuracy of the BMS is also a major determining factor in the performance of the EV, as it directly affects the miles per charge an electric vehicle can safely deliver. And to add to the challenge, that accuracy needs to be maintained through extreme environmental conditions and harsh interference over the 10-plus year life cycle of the car. Such an application challenge is a perfect fit for ADI, where we once again, leverage our deep heritage and accurate precision measurement to provide optimized solutions for battery management.We've got the industry's broadest IC portfolio supporting all battery voltages from 48 volts to 800 volts, covering the full range of premium electric vehicles right down to the entry level. Our products are also designed specifically for harsh automotive environments, enabling us to deliver up to 20% more miles per charge than our competition. We delivered the highest level of automotive functional safety and have a full suite of powerful safety diagnostics that are easy to integrate and use.So thanks to these advantages, we now have a leadership position across key customers in the US, Europe and Asia, giving us confidence that we can continue to grow BMS revenue at a double-digit annual rate and we continue to push the innovation curve.Future generations on our BMS roadmap, include architectural innovations that will improve the way power density, accuracy and weight challenges are solved, including the ability to wirelessly and robustly communicate.And finally, our opportunity extends beyond the car to the charging station infrastructure that sources, stores and transfer the energy that powers electric vehicles. Charging stations represent a unique challenge for electric grids due to their intermittent and substantial demand peaks, and it must also effectively and cost efficiently meet the fast-charging requirements consumers demand for their EVs. As a result, charging stations rely on battery powered energy storage systems to accurately and quickly charge a vehicle. Here the precision of our BMS solution kind of reduce the total cost of ownership of the energy storage system by a third, by extending the battery's life by up to 2 times and lowering maintenance costs.As demand for batteries rises, we're beginning to see a push toward extending a battery's useful life by enabling a second life for EV batteries and infrastructure applications. We believe ADI's best-in-class measurement capabilities will become increasingly important as this market matures and the second life deployments begin to scale.So in closing, electrification represents a highly valuable market for ADI for the long term. It presents a number of difficult challenges for our customers, challenges that our portfolio and people are transforming into opportunities every day. Through our battery management, power conversion connectivity and isolation technology, we're delivering innovative solutions that position us to capture revenue growth opportunities throughout the electrification ecosystem today and well into the future.And so with that, let me hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financial details. -- Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our third quarter . My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.Before I get to the results for the quarter. I wanted to provide some details related to the ongoing situation with Huawei. A few weeks into our third quarter, the Commerce Department added them to the BIS Entity List. ADI immediately suspended shipments of all products. After a thorough review of the export administration regulations and the entity lift restrictions, we determined that we could lawfully resume shipping selected ADI products to this customer. We are closely monitoring this dynamic situation and feel that we are well positioned to adapt as the circumstances evolve.The scope, duration and long-term financial impact of the export restrictions remain unclear and difficult to predict. But at least for the near term, our Huawei demand has taken a step down from previous levels. As a result, we are planning for sales to this customer to be meaningfully below our previous mid-single digit percentage range, which we discussed with you last quarter. This is reflected in our guidance, which was published in our earnings release.So now, let's get on to the quarter. ADI delivered a strong third quarter with revenue, operating margin and EPS, all above the midpoint of guidance. Our B2B revenue was down a modest 3% year-over-year, as growth in communications was balanced by ongoing weakness in industrial and automotive markets. The industrial market, which represented 51% of sales in the quarter, decreased 4% year-over-year. And while most applications were down year-over-year, we saw continued strength in our aerospace, defense, healthcare and electronic test and measurement businesses. Communications represented 21% of sales during the quarter and grew 7% year-over-year.While both wireless and wired results were impacted by Huawei, our wireless sales still increased double digits year-over-year, driven by record revenue across multiple customers, a testament to our balanced and market-leading position in advanced radio systems used in the 5G infrastructure.Automotive represented 15% of sales and was down 9% year-over-year, reflective of the ongoing decline in global vehicle sales. Year-to-date, our auto revenue is down [Technical Issue] digits year-over-year, outperforming a declining SAAR due to strength in BMS, which has increased double digits over this time, and the ongoing momentum in our power franchise.And lastly, consumer made up 12% of sales and decreased 18% year-over-year.So now, let's go to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was above the midpoint of guidance at approximately $1.48 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Gross margins came in at 70.4%, down 20 basis points sequentially, due to lower factory utilization. And then what is normally a higher OpEx quarter due to our merit increases, we reduced OpEx by $6 million sequentially to $438 million. And as we continue to navigate these challenging times, you can look for us to keep a tight rein on discretionary and non-essential spending.Our prudent OpEx spend offset slightly lower gross margins and resulted in op margins of 40.8%, above the midpoint of guidance. Non-op expenses in the quarter were down $4 million sequentially, driven by lower interest expense as we continue to reduce debt. And the tax rate for the quarter was 14%, in line with our outlook. All told, the adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance at $1.26.Let me comment on the balance sheet. We exited the quarter at 129 days of inventory, above the high end of our target range of 115 days to 125 days. This increase related primarily to weaker Huawei demand and as we discussed with you in the first quarter , the initial build of our bridge inventory to support the planned closure of two manufacturing facilities in early 2021. As a reminder, we expect to generate $100 million of cost of good synergies related to these facility closures. And during this transitional phase, we expect to carry an additional five days to 10 days of inventory to support our customers.Channel inventory was just over eight weeks, as we exited the third quarter, and capex returned to our normal level of 4% of sales or $58 million as much of our colocation activities are now complete.We generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, and during that time, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. Specifically in the third quarter, we repaid $300 million of debt, paid $200 million in dividends and repurchased over $100 million of our stock.So now let's move to guidance, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will also be discussed on an adjusted basis. Revenue is expected to be $1.45 billion plus or minus $50 million. And at the midpoint, we expect our B2B market of industrial, automotive and communications in the aggregate, to decrease low-to-mid single-digit year-over-year. And as a point of reference, if we back Huawei way out of our year-over-year Q4 compares, B2B is roughly flat.Operating margin is expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint and non-op expenses are expected decline sequentially by approximately $5 million, and the tax rate will remain in the 13% to 15% range. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.22 plus or minus $0.07.So in closing, we are pleased with our quarter results, given the current macro and geopolitical climate and during these uncertain times, we will carefully manage our expenses while also investing strategically in areas that continue to position us to deliver profitable growth over the long term.So let me hand it back to Mike, so we can start our Q&A. -- Thanks, Prashanth. Now let's get to the Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we'll give you an opportunity for follow-up questions. Cheryl, can we have our first question, please.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Yeah, good afternoon -- good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results given the backdrop. Vince, I'm wondering if you could help me better understand, clearly I think one of the consequences at the trade dispute between China and the US is that Huawei is more intent to kind of be able to build a base station with non-US suppliers.I'm wondering if you can help me understand then, your perspective and the fact that you play in. How easily can Huawei do that? Do you view Huawei as just a transitory issue for the Company, or do you think there could be some long-term real socket share loss as Huawei tries to lessen its dependence on US component suppliers? -- Yeah. Thanks, John. We've been -- as a company, we're in business almost 55 years now and we've been competing with players from all over the globe in all areas of our business, different players in different spaces. But what I will say is, in general, we've taken the highest performance position in 5G base stations in the radio systems. And whether that's Chinese OEMs that are absorbing our products, European whatever Korean, that's our game.And as these systems become ever more complex, performance matters more and more and more and more when you were trying to really put more information density through every radio. That's where we play and nobody competes with us at that level. There are perhaps different ways to solve the problem. You can sector price performance, perhaps. But if you're looking for the best-in-class 5G radio performance, it's ADI that the OEMs are coming to.And one of the thoughts I want to leave you with John, is that, whatever happens -- whatever happens, the ongoing situation with regard to Huawei, we are very well penetrated as a corporation across the globe with all the OEMs. So no matter what happens, we will grow in 2020, that's the -- that is the expectation. So, competition is just the facet of doing business and we are more than well prepared with the portfolio of products we already have, and the products that we have coming.So -- and I want to make it clear as well that, the restriction that we are experiencing with regard to shipping into Huawei specifically, is around 5G. Our legacy 4G products have been shipping, and as far as I understand, will continue to ship. So -- also it's an evolving situation and we are doing everything we can to be able to satisfy the needs of all our customers and in China, specifically, we are in the process of seeking the licenses that we need to support our products in the short-to-medium term here.So hopefully, that answers your question, John. -- Hey John, do you [Speech Overlap]. -- Yeah, Vince that's helpful. Yeah, just one surprise [Phonetic]. In our prepared comments Prashanth mentioned that excluding Huawei, your B2B business would be kind of flat year-over-year in the October quarter, which is meaningfully better than your peers. Is that mainly still just the comms phenomenon, which I think is well understood by investors, or can you talk about bottoms-up drivers in the industrial and auto that might be helping you guys drive that outperformance on year-on-year growth? -- Yeah, I think industrial is -- it is much more than comms. I think we are very pleased with how strong our industrial business is. But let me have Mike kind of break down how to think about it on a year-over-year basis, if you back out Huawei. -- Yeah, so John, the questions -- if you look at our outlook, it kind of assumes I'd say, pretty much flattish year-over-year in industrial. If you move on to automotive, it's down about 10% and comms also down about 10%. But if we let you back out Huawei, comms is up once again year-over-year and that is -- would mark kind of, I think our 11th or 12th quarter in a row of year-over-year growth in comms. That kind of goes what we then said about the breadth of our portfolio across customers.And if you move away from B2B and the consumer, it's down double digits and it's kind of right in line for the year, down about 20%. And Vince, you want to talk about industrial and kind of the strength we're seeing there and why we're doing better than our peers? -- Yeah. So I think if you look at, if you look at industrial in kind of two buckets, we have our more fragmented broader base business, specifically automation. And I'd say that business right now, given its high-intensity capex needs is weaker pretty much across all geographic spaces at this point in time. I don't think it will be a great surprise to tell you that the memory test business has been weak now almost for a year, and that persists. It remains at least tepid.But I think the areas where we're seeing more strength right now are aerospace and defense. And in fact, that's increasing just about 20% year-on-year, given the record defense budget that has just been passed in the US. We're seeing good growth across all the sub-applications within aerospace and defense. And one of the real point of strength for ADI and what's driving a lot of the growth is the combination of the microwave and RF technologies from Hittite with the mixed signal products from ADI. And we're starting to bring LTC more aggressively into that space as well. So that's the future growth dimension in that aerospace and defense business.Healthcare continues to grow nicely. I think in general, I've been pretty public that I think that's a space whose time has really come. And I think this digital health area in general, is just at an inflection point, it's just at the knee of the curve, so to speak. So that's doing well for us across the board, whether it's big-iron, our clinical grade patient monitoring type systems. And given again, the growth in areas like 5G, BMS, very, very high frequency automotive radar safety systems, the electronic test and measurement side of things, is performing well also. So I think that helps unpack the industrial story hopefully for you. Thanks John. -- Thanks, John. We'll go [Speech Overlap]Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Good morning, Tore. -- Yes. Good morning and congratulations on the execution in this environment. First question is on communications. Vince, you said you expect to grow pretty nicely in calendar '20. I was just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what's driving that. I mean, is that when 5G kind of really kicks in, because obviously up until now, a lot of the growth has been more 4.5G, so if you could elaborate on that please? -- Yeah. So thanks, Tore. The -- look, I think the way to think about 5G is, one of the most exciting new platforms to be introduced into the world of information and communication technology for several years. So it's very -- I believe it will be very pervasive. It's in the early stages of deployment and we're looking at a multi-year cycle here. One of the things I think is -- that's important to remember with 5G is that, it's really designed to enable B2B users to modify their business models and their offerings to their customers, whether it's in industrial, whether it's in healthcare where critical connection to the system is really important. So I think it's less about the consumer, more about B2B.Data is doubling every couple of years. So the need for bandwidth and very low latency is real and is necessary, and that won't abate. That will continue to intensify over time. And the only way to solve that is by delivering more special -- our spectral efficiency. So, I think what we're seeing is very, very early stage deployment and the radio was one of the most critical elements in the development and deployment of these new 5G systems. And I think over the next three years, four years, we'll start to see the virtualization of the network and a more aggressive introduction of the Microwave technology as well, that will be the next generation of 5G.So I think, as you know, as I said in the -- in an earlier comment there, we're very well positioned technologically. The problems are getting tougher and tougher in the base station from a performance standpoint. So the portfolio lines very well gets ahead of our customers' needs there and we're very well penetrated across the board in terms of the breadth of our portfolio and the depth of our portfolio. I will also point out that the power portfolio from LT is nicely fitting in as well. So that's another wave of growth that we'll begin to see materialize during 2020, 2021. -- Hey Tore, do you have a follow-up? -- Yes. Thank you for that, Vince. As a follow-up, you talked about the electrification in BMS. I'm just wondering when you're talking to your automotive customers right now and especially given the sort of challenging SAAR environment, are you seeing an acceleration in the designs for BMS and EV? -- Very definitely, Tore. I think if -- you know whether it's European, US, Japanese or Asian OEMs, there is a pervasive move toward electrification of the powertrain. So the -- we're very confident that the BMS portfolio that we have, we're on a fifth generation incidentally. And having met several of these OEMs over the last quarter or two, I can tell you that there is a level of intensity and urgency to move more toward electrical powertrains. And given that BMS or electric powertrain today represents around 2% of all the vehicles built, that's likely to increase by an order of magnitude over the next decade or so.So I think it's very real. I certainly am growing in confidence that these trends that we're seeing is becoming more intense, and it's something that we're very well positioned to take advantage of. I mentioned as well in the prepared remarks that we are moving on to yet another generation, we're changing the way the connectivity of the information is rendered in the car with our new wireless BMS architecture, which we've introduced to the market. And we'll start to see, I think, significant revenue accrue there in the, kind of, '20-'21 time frame. -- Very helpful, thank you. -- We'll go to our next caller, please.Our next question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I think that one of the more interesting things by ADI is just kind of the ramp in the content you guys are seeing on 5G. So I just want to clarify what you guys are talking about for 2020? So, if we assume that Huawei is entirely banned, do you guys still believe you're going to see, so I guess, a notable growth within communications, is that fair? -- Yeah. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, [Technical Issue] it goes to, one, we have very good share across the ecosystem, and two, is the additional content we see in these systems. There's two flavors really of 5G out that is the subsidy of gigahertz, and those systems, our silicon content is about 4 times out of a traditional 4G. And then as you move to higher frequency millimeter wave, the additional content on top of that 4 times, that's also an opportunity for ADI. That's really the ADI Hittite portfolio and also Linear bringing in there as well. -- Got it. Okay, and then secondly, I kind of want to turn real quickly to the industrial segment. I mean it looks like you guys are gaining share there. I'm curious again, what you guys think the overall market is doing within Industrial, and if you guys think this is something you can sustain over the next few quarters as well? So, I'm not saying that the industrial segment will grow, but more just in terms of you guys being able to continue to gain share against companies like TI? -- Yeah, well this is an area where -- I mean, this is the core of area in many ways and it represents about half of the Company's total revenue. About seven years, eight years, nine years ago, we retooled the entire investment portfolio of the Company from an R&D and from a go-to-market perspective, just focused more intensely on B2B applications and industrial has been the priority there. So I think what we're seeing now is the benefit of the new product crop that we've been able to introduce there. We've a lot of exciting new things coming, that are in the pipeline, that was on the cusp of materializing into revenue.So -- also our customer engagements are continuing to evolve from, I would say, seven years, eight years, nine years ago, we were largely a component provider. Now we are providing different forms of solutions, collections of components, more -- highly integrated products for different types of applications. So I think in many, many ways, what we're seeing now is the culmination of many, many years of very targeted activity to become stronger in industrial. -- Mitch, I might just add that, remember this particular market is very sticky. So the momentum that we have, as Vince talked about, has taken several years to build and once you have it, you kind of roll with it. And I would expect to see that continued strength versus the broader market play out over the coming years. -- Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. -- Go to next caller Cheryl, please?Your next question comes from C.J. Muse at Evercore . Your line is open. -- Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Vince, you talked in great deal on the BMS side. I was hoping just to follow up there. As you think about increasing technology requirements within the portfolio and how you're investing and proceeding there, I guess, two questions. One, I think it's about 5% of your revenues today, where do you think that could be five years from now? And then two, how are you seeing changes in the competitive landscape, as we proceed both electric vehicles and hybrid from here? -- Yeah. Thanks, C.J. First and foremost, we're playing on the high end. Our portfolio is targeted at kind of mid-to-high end applications where the problems are [Technical Issue] and we're able to leverage our strength in precision signal processing. That really has been the mainstay of the Company for the last five decades. I would say, in terms of what you can expect in terms of growth, my sense is, this will be a double-digit growth area for several years to come. -- Great. And I guess, as a follow-up for Prashanth, at what point in terms of outstanding debt would you focus 100% of your free cash flow on buybacks and dividends as opposed to paying down debt? -- Yeah. Good question, C.J. I don't want to -- I don't want to lock us into a specific position, but I'll say a couple of comments. One, this is a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash flow. So compared to how the Company was run several years ago, we are very comfortable with debt on the balance sheet, and I don't see us ever moving to kind of the large cash surplus that we used to be at. What is -- we're really focused on maintaining that investment grade rating, so we're going to be mindful of what the broader interest rate environment looks like and how the ratings agencies view us to ensure that we're doing what's necessary to kind of maintain that investment grade.Having said that, we're going to throw off a lot of cash. We just did a refi two -- I'd say, a quarter ago where we moved some of our five-year term into a shorter duration. So expect us to kind of continue moving to drive that down. And I would highlight that we have been meaningfully taking down our share count in 2019 and I think you can expect us to continue to do that in 2020. -- Thanks C.J. -- Very helpful, thank you. -- Let's move to the next question please.Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Good morning, Craig. Okay, Craig. -- On auto electrification, in terms of your positioning and long-term growth drivers, a number of suppliers have noted just near-term weakness in China just from a subsidy perspective and uncertainty around demand. Any color that you have in terms of what you're seeing in the China market on a near-term basis? -- Hey, Craig. Yeah. I mean we play -- in the market, we have a market-leading position across kind of the big market for us. What I'll say is, yes, last quarter we did grow year-over-year, but it was less than 2Q in BMS, and we still did grow. But it's a lumpy deployment base business. And if you look over the year-to-date, we're up double digits and we expect to grow year-over-year, again, in our fourth quarter even with what's going on in China. -- And Craig, I do want to maybe reiterate the prepared remarks that Vince mentioned. For us, it is much more than just about managing the battery as efficiently as possible. We enjoyed growth with the processors who form and test the batteries. We have the LTC capabilities that helped drive efficient use of that power to help extend the range and we're also in the charging station. So as the whole ecosystem continues to build out to support electric vehicles, for us it's a much bigger play than just focusing on the batteries. -- Do you have a follow-up Craig? -- Understood. Thanks for that incremental color. Yes, I guess a follow-up. Prashanth, just on the manufacturing and some of the things you're doing with the footprint consolidation, any update in terms of gross margin impact of when you would expect to see some synergies from that? -- Yeah, thanks for the -- thanks for the question, Craig. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our inventory is a little bit higher this quarter, because we are starting to put the bridge inventory that's necessary for us to be able to close the facilities in Singapore and California. So we'll need that bridge inventory so that we can continue to serve customers, while we take those facilities down. We are targeting those savings to start coming through the P&L in 2021 -- early 2021 and that -- as we've been public in several calls, that should be about an incremental $100 million on a run rate basis, that's all flowing through cost of goods sold. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thanks, Craig. Can we have next question, please?Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Vivek? Good morning. Vivek. Okay. Vivek, we're going to go to the next caller.Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Stacey. -- Let's start with OpEx. So obviously, you mentioned being a little more concerned on expenses given the environment. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that OpEx trajectory going into Q4. Are you sort of bottomed at this point given where variable comp is on the metrics, or is there room to still take OpEx down? I guess, what are the implications for OpEx, given the continued weak environment that you see? -- Yeah, thanks for the question. Stacy. So I think the way to -- first, as a reminder, we don't guide gross margins anymore. If I answer OpEx question, I am implicitly giving you that guidance. -- But qualitatively. -- Yeah, the way to think about it is, we are -- we're -- we have made a meaningful reduction in our OpEx versus our Q2. So we had a sequential improvement going into Q3. We're looking for that to kind of carry roughly flattish for the fourth quarter. We will focus on the variable cost that we can control, and continue to exercise OpEx discipline. As we've said before, one of the levers we do have is our compensation system, which is meant to act as a flywheel as businesses go up and down and that will certainly be an element of the Q4. -- Got it. -- Thank you. -- I do. Thank you. So in the prepared remarks, Vince mentioned that obviously the macro environment is still challenging, isn't getting better in the near term. Would you say that -- from your perspective versus where your expectations were three months ago, have things gotten worse versus where your prior expectations had been?I guess, just where have you been expecting things to kind of go into the year-end and are things worse and that are they sort of similar to where you had expected them to be three months ago? -- Yeah, Thanks, Stacy. Well, I'd say the uncertainty in the trade tensions between America and China have obviously ratcheted up. I think it's indeterminant. What will actually happen there, in the short-to-medium term, PMI indices as well as GDPs are falling somewhat. So I think that headwind has increased somewhat, I think, since the last quarter.I think when I try to classify how customers are thinking about the world, the world of technology is gearing up. There is more and more innovation, the R&D budgets are very, very strong across the globe in all the sectors. So I think customers remain optimistic about the future, but I'd say right at this point in time, the people who commit the capex, commit the investments, are probably a little less optimistic about the future than they were, say, a quarter ago. So that's pretty much the best commentary I can give you Stacy. -- Okay. And I guess, in our conference at the end of May, Vince, you had sounded pretty positive about potentially getting a trade deal, it doesn't sound like we're there anymore. -- Well, who really knows. I think both sides are working on it. I think incidentally, both sides want the deal, but I think it depends on the conditions. And what's out there in the public domain is that both sides are digging their heels in at this point. So yeah, I'd say Stacy, to answer question directly, the sense of a trade deal by the end of the summer, which is a looming very quickly here, is less likely than it was when you and I spoke back in May. -- Right Stacy, thank you for that. Three points you got [Technical Issue] in there. Operator, we're going to try to go back to Vivek, if we can. And that will be our last question today.Okay. Your next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Can you hear me now? -- We can, Vivek. -- Okay. Sorry for the screw up before. So first question, how should we think about seasonality going into your January quarter? Historically, it's a positive quarter, but I know you've had consumer volatility and this time, there is also the Huawei and trade war volatility. So I'm just curious, how is your visibility kind of one quarter out right now? -- Although a typical seasonality, I would say is not a typical time. I'll caveat with that and we're not giving guidance for a quarter out. Typically first quarter is a weaker quarter for us in B2B. Industrial is typically down, almost typically down. I do think -- and the comms market, we talked about it being weaker here in the fourth quarter. It was very volatile and I think you see a quick acceleration back there in the first quarter, and consumer will update you on next call, kind of our outlook for 2020. But I think you can expect this soon to be down again in 2020, but to a lesser degree than '19. -- All right. -- Do you have a follow-up for that? -- Then the other -- yeah. Thank you. The other thing, Vince, I know there is a lot of macro uncertainty right now, but when I look at your automotive and industrial businesses, so they were down kind of 6% year-on-year for the last couple of quarters. If I look at the guidance you're giving for October, it's down about -- I think about 2% year-on-year and you're saying industrial can be actually flat year-on-year, which is much better than what we have seen in the last few quarters. So I'm just trying to reconcile all the uncertainty in the macro environment versus the October quarter, kind of, industrial outlook. That seems somewhat more positive when I look at it. -- Yeah. We have a couple of specific areas where we are seeing strength, aerospace and defense being kind of top of the list there. For a range of reasons, it's a combination of budgets being increased in the area of aerospace and defense, and also the strength of the technology portfolio that we bring. And I mentioned earlier on that healthcare continues to grow for the Company. It's an area, again, where we've been increasing investments over the last five years, seven years, and that's an area that I continue to be very optimistic about and think it will be a very good source of growth for the Company for many, many years to come. So there are the two areas, Vivek, that are most meaningfully contributing on the industrial side right now to the strength we're seeing relative to the market. -- And Vivek, I know you asked specifically about the change in trajectory in Q4, but I would want to remind you that kind of on a year-to-date basis, those numbers you quoted have been substantially better than the broader market. So we have outperformed, although the industrial market has been down on a year-to-date basis for us. We've generally outperformed the broader market. -- Yeah, absolutely. Okay, thank you. -- Okay. Thank you, Vivek. So thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A copy the transcript will be available on our website and all of our reconciliations and information can also be found there. Thanks again, for joining us and look forward to talking to you in 90 days.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

Comparing units outstanding versus one week ago at the coverage universe of ETFs at ETF Channel, the biggest inflow was seen in the iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF, which added 20,400,000 units, or a 5.8% increase week over week. Among the largest underlying components of IWR, in morning trading today Servicenow is up about 1.9%, and Analog Devices is up by about 2.2%.

And on a percentage change basis, the ETF with the biggest increase in inflows was the Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares, which added 1,150,000 units, for a 37.2% increase in outstanding units.

There are 13 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Analog Devices Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $90.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $140.00.  The standard deviation is $14.198.


But the whole reason to look at the average ADI price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with ADI crossing above that average target price of $113.54/share, investors in ADI have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $113.54 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Analog Devices Inc:

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 9th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new August 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $111.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $111.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $108.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $113.29/share today.

Because the $111.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.25% return on the cash commitment, or 19.12% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $111.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $114.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $113.29/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $114.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.80% if the stock gets called away at the August 9th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $114.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $114.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.18% boost of extra return to the investor, or 26.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 31%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 32%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $113.29) to be 30%.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2019 , Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 , which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. -- Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone, who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.Now, on to the disclosures. The information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.Our comments today about ADI's second quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from these prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. Okay.With that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? -- Thanks very much, Mike, and a very good morning to everybody on the call. But before I get into my recap of the quarter, I wanted to briefly touch on recent developments. As you're no doubt aware, the US government announced last week that it's restricting a large communications company from acquiring US products and technology. While this will have at least a short-term impact on our communications business, our business is global, broad and robust, and we'll manage through this. Prashanth will give a bit more insight into the anticipated financial impact of this development during his particular section.So now onto our highlights. The second quarter of fiscal '19 was another successful quarter for ADI, with the revenue from our B2B markets increasing year-over-year once again. This represents the 12th consecutive quarter of annual B2B revenue growth, which is really a testament to the diversity of our franchise and our ability to innovate ahead of secular growth opportunities.Revenue of $1.53 billion came in at the high end of our guidance, led by strong year-over-year growth from our communications applications across multiple segments. Adjusted gross and operating margins increased compared to last quarter to 70.6% and 41.5%, respectively. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.36, which was also at the high end of outlook. Now, over the past 12 months, we've generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow or 34% of revenue and during that time period, we've returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments.Now , before we move on to the financial section of our call, I'd like to continue our discussion around ADI's key markets, their trends and ADI's strategic initiatives, positioning us to capitalize on these opportunities. We previously discussed our strong position in the wireless market, particularly in massive MIMO and 5G where our content opportunity is up to 4 times compared to traditional 4G systems.So today, I'm going to talk about the other third of our comms business, namely the wireline market. The wireline market is very profitable. It's a steady growth business for ADI with the combined Company having grown at a high-single digit rate annually for the past five years. The market and its challenges around precision, control and power are a perfect match for ADI's comprehensive portfolio and domain expertise. There are many applications within the wireline business, but today I want to focus on the fastest growing segment, namely the optical market.The primary driver of the wireline market is unsurprisingly exponential growth in demand for digital data. IP traffic across carrier networks and data centers is doubling every two and a half years, driven primarily by cloud compute, backhaul of 4G and 5G networks and consumption of data rich content. This extraordinary growth represents a significant challenge for the carrier networks and data centers that transport and manage this data, as it's not possible to lay new optical fiber, our double data center floor space every two years. So their challenge is ADI's opportunity.The two primary ways to solve their data throughput problem are increasing the speed of the existing fiber network and reducing the form factor of data ports to increase data density. Carriers are increasing their speed of their networks by upgrading from a 100 gigabits per second to 400 gbps. (ph) And in some cases to more than a terabit per second. At the same time, optical modules are being scaled down by 2X, 4X and even 10X. At this level of data throughput, our customers are pushing the optical components and subsystems such as lasers, modulators and coherent signal processing to their physical limits.Precisely controlling throughput, managing synchronization, compensating for signal impairments and reducing system noise is critical to overall system performance. By partnering closely with our customers, we're developing highly optimized optical control and power management products that match the smaller form factor required in next generation optical systems. Importantly, for every 4X increase in speed in an existing network, our control content opportunity increases by more than a third. This 400 gig controlled port space is the fastest growing segment of our optical business, largely driven by the rapid growth in data center port traffic. But a high-precision signal chain only solves part of the problem in these next-gen carrier and data center networks.Denser optical networks create power and thermal challenges that our customers must also mitigate to avoid harmful impact on the network's potential speed and data throughput, not to mention impact on their operating expense as power and cooling represent over 30% of the data center's total cost of ownership. That is a huge opportunity for our power portfolio. We're taking our core power franchises, namely micro module and silent switcher technologies, for example, and leveraging ADI's market leading position to broaden our customer reach and develop optimized solutions for this market.In addition to optical port solutions, we also supply innovative power sequencing and hot swap products. These technologies enable our customers to mitigate costly downtime and the void disruptions by managing the highly complex power chain of networking servers and (inaudible) The addressable market for these solutions continues to grow as port and data traffic density continues to increase.Now, I said in the past that for every dollar of signal chain we sell into a system, there is at least a $1 of power opportunity and the wireline market is no different. Since our combination with LTC , we've seen our pipeline in power for the wireless market expand very significantly. So in closing, we expect continued profitable growth over the long-term in the wireline market is control and power challenges intensify in response to the market's densification with the ever-increasing bandwidth demand. And thus provider shift for silicon photonics, we expect even more opportunity for ADI as control and power solutions are necessary to compensate for the lower inherent performance of these silicon-based photonic solutions.And with that, let me hand it over to Prashanth. -- Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter . My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.Now, onto the quarter. In the face of geopolitical uncertainty, we are pleased to report strong second quarter results with revenue, operating margin and EPS, all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance. As usual, I will cover the end markets before moving to the P&L. Our second quarter B2B revenue increased approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our communications business.The industrial market, which represented 50% of sales in the quarter performed as expected, decreasing mid-single digits compared to the year ago quarter. Strength in aerospace and defense was outweighed by the anticipated weakness in our automation and memory test businesses. The comps market represented 24% of sales during the quarter and experienced very strong double-digit year-over-year growth, led by ongoing strength in wireless, while our wireline franchise also continued to grow nicely.Our results this quarter reflect ADI's higher content and share in 5G. We believe 5G remains in the early stages and our technology remains a key enabler. And as Vince, just highlighted in his section, our wireline business is well positioned to continue to grow profitably in the years ahead. Our auto business represented 16% of sales and was relatively flat compared to the year ago quarter. Strength in BMS, which increased well over 20% year-over-year and momentum in our power franchise helped to mitigate the overall weakness in vehicle units during the quarter. And lastly, our consumer business represented just 10% of sales in the quarter, the lowest consumer mix since 2016. As expected, this segment decreased on a year-over-year basis.And now, moving to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.53 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at 70.6%, up 30 basis points sequentially, but lower year-over-year, primarily due to market mix. And what is normally a higher OpEx quarter, OpEx decreased sequentially to $443 million.Operating margin of 41.5% came in stronger than our guided mid-point. Non-op expenses in the quarter were $61 million, slightly higher sequentially with the increase primarily related to a one-time expense in the quarter. Interest expense decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Tax rate for the quarter was better than forecasted at approximately 11%. And all told, adjusted diluted earnings per share from the second quarter came in at the high end of guidance at $1.36.Now, moving now to the balance sheet, as is normal in the second quarter, inventory dollars and days increased slightly sequentially. And our channel inventory also increased sequentially and year-over-year, but still remained comfortably in our target range. CapEx in the second quarter was $75 million or 5% of sales for the full year. We expect CapEx to be temporarily higher and remain at approximately 5%. This additional spend is to support future growth opportunities, especially for our power franchise, as well as the colocation of our product and business development teams.Free cash flow was approximately $2.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 6% year-over-year, despite the additional CapEx outlay. Over the past 12 months, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, after debt repayments. In the second quarter, we repaid $250 million of debt, paid $200 million in dividends and repurchased over $100 million of our stock.Now, before moving to guidance, I want to give some context around the additional uncertainty impacting this quarter's outlook. As Vince mentioned, the US government recently announced export restrictions to a large communications company. Our third quarter guidance takes into account the estimated impact on ADI from these restrictions, including no revenue from that customer for the remainder of the quarter. We are currently reviewing our ability to resume shipments under the recently announced temporary general license. And while we do not talk about specific customers, I will say, that ADI has an extremely diverse business. The communications market is a bit more concentrated but still, over the trailing 12 months our largest communication customers only represented mid-single digits or less as a percentage of total ADI sales.So now on to the outlook, which with the exception of revenue and non-op expense are on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items outlined in today's release. Third quarter revenue is expected to be $1.45 billion, plus or minus $50 million. And at the midpoint, we expect our B2B market of industrial, automotive and communications in the aggregate to decrease low-single digits year-over-year. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect third quarter operating margin to be approximately 40.5%, non-op expenses are expected to decline sequentially to approximately $56 million, and we are improving our projected tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% for the year.Based on these inputs, the diluted EPS excluding special items is expected to be $1.22, plus or minus $0.07. So overall it was a very successful first half of the year for ADI, especially when you overlay it with an uncertain economic and political backdrop. I remained very confident that the investments we have made and continue to make will position us for continued outperformance over the long term.Let me hand it back to Mike to start our Q&A. -- Okay. Let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we'll give you an opportunity for a follow-up question. Sheryl, can we have our first question, please.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open. -- Good morning, Tore. -- Thank you. Yes, good morning. Thank you. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about your core business excluding communications. Obviously, I know that's a very specific situation. But if you look at especially industrial and auto, are those markets starting to show a path of recoveries? If you could add some color there, that'd be great. Thank you. -- Yes. sure. Thanks, Tore. Well, let me start with industrial. So I think it's true to say that business has stabilized across the board. We see our customers' inventory levels being very, very normal and also channel inventory, which is often a proxy for what's going on in the industrial market, is in line also with our targets. I think overall when the macro turns, I think we see a lot of upside improvement to the business, as confidence improves and CapEx is deployed at higher rates.So if I try to unpack it a little bit for you. So in terms of the second quarter, it performed pretty much as we expected. And particularly, we were pleased with the results that we achieved in the aerospace and defense area where the combination of the hit item ADI signal processing solutions are really coming to the floor there, where we're taking share as a company, and we see that as a good steady growth driver for many, many years to come.Geographically, I think it's true to say, where a lot of our industrial business is centered at Europe and America, we are up year-on-year, very stable. And the areas of weakness we saw were largely in Asia, all the various major regions of Asia. So looking out a little bit here, we're seeing stabilization and I think we will see some -- we'll see some annual growth in the third quarter here as well. So I think that's kind of the shape of the industrial business.And if I just talk about the automotive sector for a little bit here. So our performance on revenue was a much better than units and SAAR. And we did see a very modest build in channel. We're on (inaudible) accounting these days when we report to the Street and that we don't see a little bit of growth there. But the performance was driven by our growing position in battery management systems for electric vehicles. I think also, I'm very pleased to say that our power business is improving across the board. We did better in power then SAAR for example. So when we look at our performance, power did better than the unit growth in terms of vehicles sold. And also our A2B solutions in the infotainment sector continue to ramp gradually here.So -- I think if you look at more SAAR-exposed applications, steady-state applications, in infotainment for example, they were down high-single digits. And that represents about two thirds of the overall business. So I think the portfolio is very balanced. We've got many new things coming on board that help us to outgrow any particular weaknesses in SAAR. -- And Tore, I'll add one point. You asked about kind of stabilization. We are seeing stabilization in industrial market. And I think what we're excited about is, it's kind of a better decline year-over-year, we expect in the third quarter versus our second quarter results, o we declined about 6% in the second quarter. We think it's going to better in the third quarter on year-over-year basis. -- Do you have a follow up? -- Yes. Thank you for all the color, really helpful. As a follow-up, if we look at the communication customer that we're talking about here. How long will it take for a company like ADI to now maybe requalify some of that business with other potential customers? Thank you. -- Well, I think we're in a very, I would say, great situation here, Tore. We are very well covered as a company across all the various major OEMs with good penetration in fact, historically, high penetration across all the various OEMs. So I think I should start up this -- the conversation by saying that, generally speaking, 5G is a trend (inaudible) technology, and that is yet really to begin. I think we're seeing trials in Japan and Korea at this point in time. But it's really yet to begin and earnest in any volume. And that's probably going to come in the 2020 timeframe.So no matter what happens, in terms of puts and takes, carrier and OEM relationships, I think the Company is well positioned. And specific to China, I guess it's a question of when deployments happen rather than, if they happen. And we still have to navigate a lot of uncertainty here in terms of the trade ban. So we're going to know a lot more I think over the next two, three months. But as I said, I think it's a case of when deployments happen globally rather than this. And we're in a good position in terms of the dollar content we've got at the various OEMs and our position across all the OEMs at this point in time. -- Thank you. We'll move to our next caller, please. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next caller comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Good morning, Vivek. -- Thank you for taking my question. Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And a good job on maintaining the profitability, despite all these macro and Huawei headwinds. Vince, it's interesting that your comments on industrial sound somewhat more optimistic than some of your peers, who have -- are looking at all this tariff situation, and they're sounding somewhat more downbeat. Is it some company-specific product cycles? How are you sounding a little more optimistic than what we are hearing from some of your peers? -- Yes, it's a good question, Vivek. We as a company, I think have been more focused on our peers in terms of R&D deployment and customer engagements over the last decade. And I think, we are generally speaking across the board, both at large say automation customers, tests, and lab-equipment type companies, and aerospace and defense, which I've talked a little bit about just a little earlier on, I think we are in a better share position though than we've ever been. It's a big, big part of who we are as a company. So there's tremendous engagements and focus.And we have many, many tens of thousands of customers. So I think bringing LTC into the fold, as well, we increased the strength of our franchise in terms of signal processing, but also the power side of things with LTE. So I think it's a combination of all those things that has positioned with largely intrinsic or endogenous things we've done over the last decade, position us to take share here. So I think it's the strength of our franchise, strength of our customer relationships, and the combination with LTC, at this point. -- Got you. And... -- Do you have a follow-up? -- ...yes. Thank you. So for the follow-up, I just wanted to make sure we are kind of all level set on what this ban Huawei actually means, right. So let's assume that, that ban stays in place, hopefully gets resolved. But for just the purpose of kind of record-keeping, there is no more Huawei-ish. Your July quarter kind of takes out Huawei, What is -- what should we assume from the following quarter? Should we just assume Huawei goes to zero after that? What is the right way to kind of de-risk the model from a Huawei perspective? Thank you. -- Yes. So for the current quarter Q3, we've presumed no more shipments. And if you take, I think your assumption is, let's assume that, that ban stays in place, then it's likely that we would be prohibited from continuing to sell to that customer for subsequent quarters. But as Vince has mentioned several times, we are largely customer agnostic. We have high share in all of the carriers. It's a very different situation than what we had in 4G. So as that demand shifts to other wireless infrastructure carriers, depending on where that deployment happens, we expect to continue to do quite well in providing the necessary technology to enable the deployment of 5G, and the continuing deployment in growth of 4G. -- Thanks, Prashanth. -- We'll go to our next question, please.Thank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Yes. Hey, guys. Just a follow-on, I want to echo. -- (multiple speakers) -- Hey, good. Thank you. I want to echo my congratulations, as well, fantastic job in this rather turbulent environment. I want to follow-up on Vivek's question. Last time, we saw this the song and dance was ZTE getting banned, and the expectation was that Huawei would step up and take share. So basically if I hear you correctly, what I think you're saying is that the customer in question, Huawei if that's banned, you're suggesting that others, including ZTE might step up and take share, and the impact would be much less than perhaps the direct business that you do with Huawei. Is that the correct way to think about it? -- Potentially, yes. I think it really depends now on how the Chinese government and the various carriers, when they reflect in things, how they decide to handle the timing of 5G release at this point in time. But there are options. I think 5G conforms to a standard, and I think all the carriers have different options. They're probably our favorites, and then we got the first favorite, the second favorite, but there are options. And the way we view it, we are well positioned in terms of our technology portfolio. In fact, many of the things we're doing, particularly in 5G are highly differentiated, with more content, more coverage in the radio systems than we've ever had. So look, it will certainly help a lot, if this trade -- this ban is lifted in a reasonable time period here. But I think irrespective, as I said in my earlier comments. The rollout of 5G is unquestionable. And it will really be a question of timing rather than if the system gets deployed. So yes. -- Yes. Harsh, just -- I'll say -- I'll pack it a little bit from kind of a number standpoint. The things we looked at, we put together our guidance was there three factors. One was, the actual shipment to that customer; two, with the secondary impact to other customers who ship to that customer; and third would be additional demand picked up by competitors of that customer. And we put all that together, that's how we came up with our guidance. And we kind of think the second too, so the secondary impact or the additional share impact kind of neutralizes zero. So really it's all about that customer going to zero in our outlook. -- Fair enough, very helpful. And then, for my follow-up, we've been trying to talk to other semiconductor companies, and they're all very confused because of just it happened. It all happened so recently. A lot of the companies are saying well, they sell directly to Huawei, but they also sell a whole bunch to industry. Would you tell us if you guys are prohibited from selling to (inaudible) Huawei as well or is there a chance that stuff could -- shipments could be moved around a little bit and perhaps, I'm not seeing the full impact is mitigated, but some partial impact is mitigated at this point. -- That's a reflect. We're as confused as everybody. The information flow is bursty and it can be often confusing. So I think the coming days -- the coming weeks will bring a lot more clarity to what's actually in the ban, what's out of the ban. But as Mike said very clearly right now, our interpretation is that we will be upholding the ban to the fullest extent and we won't be shipping anything to Huawei for the foreseeable future. -- Yes. -- And for the avoidance of doubt, we have no channel revenue in the midpoint of our guidance that we expect to go on to this communication customer. -- Understood, very helpful. Thanks guys. -- Harsh, thanks for the questions. We'll take the next one.Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The defense spending budget for this year has been a real tailwind for the team, and it's actually have been quite broad based, right, modernization, aircraft, ground systems, missile defense, and so on. A&D obviously has been doing well for the team. Can you just help us understand how A&D has been growing on a year-over-year basis? And then how has the budget focus on modernization help to kick off maybe some new potential initiatives for the team? -- Yes. Harlan, we don't talk much at the specific segment level in terms of numbers. But I will share that our aerospace and defense has been doing particularly well, and it was one of the items that helped us offset some of the decline we saw in other industrial. The overall -- sort of in the second quarter results, the -- that year-over-year growth was pretty substantial, I call it north of 25% on a year-over-year basis for aerospace. We are benefiting from those record military budgets that you've meant. So it's across all of our application areas, the communications, the UAVs, radars, space exploration areas. The combination with Hittite also helps bring a lot of new technologies that we can take advantage. So it's been a great business for us and we see that continued modernization of defense is going to pay dividends in growth for ADI for several quarters to come. -- Just to level that on the call, our industrial business is 50% of sales, but it's very diverse within that 50%. So I'll just remind everyone that aerospace and defense is about 20% of industrial, automation is about 20% of industrial, instrumentation is about 20% to 25%, healthcare is just above 10%, and then there's remainder across a bunch of, I'll call it, smaller customers. So it's a very diverse business within Industrial for us. Do you have a follow up, Harlan? -- Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the insights there. So within the comms business, really appreciate the insights on some of the new opportunities in optical, especially around signal processing and control. I believe that within wireline over the past couple of quarters, you've seen some weakness in 100 gig for optical networking targeted at cloud data centers, on the well-known set of capacity digestion by the hyperscalers. Are you guys starting to see fundamentals and 100 gig starting to improve kind of near-term? -- Yes. Harlan, our wireline business has been growing. In the last quarter, it grew mid-single digits year-over-year and the quarter before that was above 10% year-over-year. So I think it is impacting some. Our wireline business have been quite a steady growth market for us. It's been overshadowed by the wireless, also that we grow much faster, but the wireline for us and optical within that has been growing. -- Yes. I think data centers today still largely 100 gig based, but the fastest growth we are experiencing is in 400 gig. And that's both the kind of the metro long-haul, as well as the data centers. So as this data need continues to double every two and a half years, we're going to continue to see an aggressive movement to 400 gig, and in fact to a 1 terabit and beyond over the coming few years here. So I think it's a mixture and we're seeing strength across the board in our portfolio. -- Okay. Thank you, very much. Thank you. -- Thank you, Harlan. Sheryl, next caller, please?And our next question comes from Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys, thanks for let me ask my questions. First, congratulations on the automotive business being flat year-over-year, as a solid quarter by any measure. I know, Vince, you gave... -- Thank you, Ross. -- ...the color on some of those drivers with BMS et cetera. -- Yes. -- But from a bigger picture perspective, you guys had been underperforming for a few years and now you're outperforming. Is this sign of an inflection point that you think like going forward, you can go back to at least performing in line with peers or even outperforming? Or do you view this is just kind of one quarter of an improvement in that regard? -- So Ross, let me level set, how we did in the first half, and then let Vince kind of talk more broadly. So first, remember that we run our business on a -- we run the channel really on a POS basis, but we report our revenue on a POA basis. So in the second quarter, POS was down just slightly, very low-single digits, a but much better versus units. So we did see a little bit of modest build in the channel and that helped growth. But within that, certainly very strong performance in BMS, power and A2B. Vince mentioned that we've got the cabin electronics and some other businesses exposed to SAAR.So as we look forward to the second half of this year, a little bit of that channel build that we saw in the first half is probably going to provide some headwind, because we can -- we do manage the business on a POS basis. But the optimism that we have been talking about for over a year now, and the inflection in our auto business that we really expect to start in 2020, that remains a high conviction. And I'll let Vince maybe talk more about what's behind that. -- So Ross, if we go back several years, we withdrew R&D and support. We still ship some sensor products. But we've largely seen the -- I think the tailing off of some of our more commoditized MEM-sensing business begin to stabilize there. If I look at the areas where we're seeing the growth come from as a company, I think our infotainment business remains very, very strong. It's been growing year-on-year now for several.BMS, you know, still a very, very small penetration of electric vehicles in overall SAAR. And by the month, we get more and more convinced, but that's going to be a very significant business for the Company and that's -- that business is doing better and better for us. In fact, we have been capitalizing that business as well. We -- and also if you like, the portfolio from LTC. So we've been capitalizing the business in terms of R&D and equipment to make sure that we can meet the upside demands here for new products, as well as supply line for the long term.I mentioned a little bit earlier on as well that our power business, the LTE portfolio is doing increasingly better when compared to the market at large. And when you take these new emerging level 3, level 4 sensing systems that need product modalities like IMUs, that feed these advanced image quality radar systems and lidar, we are in virtually all the really important high-end solutions that are emerging at level 3 and above.So I think our business has been largely the (inaudible) the headwind on our business from the sensor side of things is baiting and these new product modalities are getting stronger and stronger in terms of direction. So that's kind of a story in automotive for you. -- That's very helpful. -- Do you have a follow up? -- Yes. I just want to pivot back to the comm side of things, and appreciating all the uncertainty and the details you've given on the call thus far. One other aspect that investors are focused on is the inventory in that area. And I know it's difficult to discern. But how are you viewing any pre-buying that might have been occurring, specifically from the now banned customer? And I think what people are concerned about is, even if the ban ends, was there enough pre-buying buffer that the snap-back afterwards might not actually occur. So any color you could have on the inventory in that channel and specifically any pre-buying would be appreciated. Thank you. -- I think the inventory in general, Ross, across the board, all our OEMs in the communications area, these new advanced architectures, I think the inventory is very, very well balanced. I don't see anything untoward or anomalous. And I think things are in good balance there. -- Yes. Ross, I'll say, even before the ban came in place, we expect our communication business -- we thought before the ban (inaudible) grow sequentially. So I don't think pre-buy was a big worry of ours, given our good share across the board. Now that obviously has changed and we think it's not going to grow sequentially. And probably on a year-over-year basis, it's only up slightly, kind of help you with some context there. -- Yes. And I think the way to think about this as well. In terms of inventory balance, like most of ADI's portfolio, it's really more a question of when the inventories that we have sell rather than if, I think that's generic to all these core B2B businesses for ADI. -- All right. (multiple speakers) -- Thanks. Let's move to our next caller, please.Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm wondering if you've analyzed or if there's any impact we might expect from additional stop-ship orders that have been speculated in the press. For example, I think it's pronounced Hikvision. I might not be getting that, right. But I'm wondering if you have any exposure to these surveillance companies in China that look like they could potentially be customers? -- Well, it's a good question. I would emphasize that the rest of the ADI business is very broad and diverse. So as more companies may be identified, there will certainly be some analysis that we will have to do. But unlike the communications business, which is among our most concentrated, the diversity of our franchise, and the large number of customers that we sell to, provide great insulation, against having kind of macro shocks from these political impacts. -- That's really helpful. -- Do you have a follow-up? -- One more, if I can. Can you talk about both for the quarter just posted and for the guidance the trends within the consumer business and specifically the split between your traditional prosumer business, and in the more volatile handset part of the business? Thank you. -- Yes. So we've -- we had originally said the -- that consumer is going to be down 10 to 20 in 2019, our forecast is really now at the high end of that, We expect to be down 20% year-over-year. We continue to see some weakness in the portables market. We are seeing a little bit of unanticipated weakness in prosumer, and how much of that is driven by the macro environments and such we're trying to assess right now. But we do think that kind of the worst is behind us and that the long-term growth for the prosumer business would -- should really align closer to GDP. And it's really similar to our B2B business. -- Yes. From a standpoint, as we exit this year, we expect our portals business our prosumer business to be about equal in size. So as it provides some more stability to that consumer business for us going forward. -- All right. Sheryl, we'll go to our last question please?Thank you. Our last question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I just wanted to make sure I understood the exposure to the large customer. And in terms of the model, Prashanth, should we'll be thinking -- you gave us a trailing 12-month number, but should we'll be thinking high-single digit? And then based on your answer to an earlier question, in terms of de-risking the model. Should we assume for the next two, three quarters, you get none of that, and then you start to other customers to pick up slack maybe two, three quarters down the road. Is that the right way to think about the model, and then the OpEx impact, as well? -- Hi, Ambrish. I'll answer the first part of your question. So I think we're pretty clear on the prepared remarks, saying our largest customer within comms was mid-single digit at most on trailing 12 months. We did have a couple of weeks of shipments, I will say in this quarter. So that won't repeat next quarter. And after that doesn't repeat in 3Q, output zero in going forward until the ban is lifted. -- And the OpEx trajectory, how should be think about the OpEx? -- Look, the OpEx, is that we're going to continue to invest in the business. Of course, where appropriate, we're going to look at our discretionary cost. But I wouldn't make a meaningful change to how we think about the OpEx. The first lever that absorbs the shock of a revenue decline is our variable compensation, so that will of course be impacted by a decline in revenue. But beyond that, we're going to -- we're committed to investing today for products and technologies that come to market several years out. -- I think the way to look at it Ambrish is that the demand for our technologies is absolutely unprecedented. So we're keeping our eye on the long-term in terms of making sure that we have new aggressive funding in place to fund all the R&D programs that we think are critical to the Company's future, the same with our customer engagements. And I mentioned with a while ago, also, we've ramped our capital expenditures to make sure, particularly on the LTE side of the business that we have, what we need to get our products to market faster, and get the supply to our customers, that we know the opportunity is there. So we're keeping our eye on the long-term price here. -- And do you have a follow-up, Ambrish? -- That makes sense. I did. Thank you for all the the clarification. Just a quick one then. In your B2B guide, I think, Vince, you mentioned you gave the color on the industrial. And then should auto, we should expect that to be up year-over-year in the current quarter that we're in? Thank you. -- Hi, Ambrish. Yes. Vince gave some comment. Industrial should actually -- should be down year-on-year, but the growth rate will be better than the second quarter (inaudible) industrial first off. Also, I would say probably down year-over-year, but much better than what, I would say units are doing out there to the things we've talked about in the other Q&A remarks, BMS and power, and ADB ramping. And communications, we also discussed it should be about, I would say flat to up slightly year-over-year. So that's kind of help you get to that low single-digit guide for B2B, as a combination. -- Awesome. Thank you. -- Okay. With that, thank you, Ambrish, and thank you everyone for joining us to this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all available reconciliations are also be on the website. Thank you. And we'll talk to you guys soon.This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

"ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at , in trading on Thursday, shares of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.16), with the stock changing hands as low as $107.84 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 — you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.  Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.



In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options become available today, for the May 31st expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new May 31st contracts and identified the following put contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $94.95 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $113.30/share today.

Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 16% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 97%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.05% return on the cash commitment, or 0.42% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $95.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   The implied volatility in the put contract example above is 44%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $113.30) to be 27%.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Analog Devices Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $90.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $130.00.  The standard deviation is $12.434.


But the whole reason to look at the average ADI price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with ADI crossing above that average target price of $112.08/share, investors in ADI have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $112.08 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: ADI)Q1 2019 Feb. 20, 2019 Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices first-quarter fiscal-year 2019  , which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. -- Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first-quarter fiscal 2019 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO Vincent Roche, and ADI's CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.Now onto the disclosures, the information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Our comment today about ADI's first-quarter fiscal 2019 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which include -- excludes special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from these prior quarter and year-over-year results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter.In addition, this is the first quarter of our adopted ASC 606 or sell-in accounting. We have restated our historical financial statements to conform to this standard, and posted a two-year quarterly end-market look back for revenue on our investor site. All comments during today's call on revenue growth and our commentary during Q&A will exclude this extra week and be on a sell-in basis, unless otherwise stated. In addition, as we move to sell-in accounting and further refine LTC's product mapping in the channel, we have adjusted approximately $80 million of annual revenue from communications to consumer.The new mapping does not impact industrial or automotive revenue. OK. With that, I'll turn over to ADI's CEO Vincent Roche. Vince? -- Thank you, Mike, and a very good morning to everybody. The first quarter of fiscal 2019 was another very successful quarter for ADI. In what is a challenging macroeconomic environment, we're executing soundly and delivering strong results. Revenue of $1.54 billion in the first quarter came in at the high-end of our guidance, led by our strong year-over-year growth in our B2B markets.This growth was driven predominantly by continued strength in our communications market related to ongoing 4G upgrades and initial 5G deployments. Adjusted operating margins of over 41% were above the midpoint of guidance, as we balanced our strategic investments with prudent discretionary spend. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.33, also at the high-end of guidance. Over the past 12 months, we have generated over $2.1 billion in free cash flow or 35% of revenue, which places ADI in the top 5% of the S&P 500.And over that same time period, we've returned more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders after debt repayments. Now while macro uncertainties continue to exist, our strong execution and results enable us to continue to invest in extending over franchise in strategic areas where we see attractive opportunities for future growth. To that end, we're investing record levels of R&D to push the boundaries of innovation and expand the breadth and depth of our franchise. In addition, we've increased our investments in our go-to-market activities to further broaden and deepen our customer reach and our engagements.The strength and resiliency of our business model allows us to innovate regardless of business conditions. This ability is imperative given the long life cycles in our markets, where average product life span is a decade or indeed more. And while some competitors pull back and lose momentum in uncertain times, we plan to continuously invest to build upon our virtuous cycle of innovation-led growth. In my 30-plus year career with ADI, I've never been more confident or excited about our prospects than I am today.The third wave of information and communications technology is creating an inflection in the analog industry. And we've built a product portfolio aimed at favorable macro trends that I believe will provide tailwinds for years to come. Now I'll provide you with some examples of what we're seeing in our B2B market specifically. Today, industrial customers are balancing CAPEX deployments with tariff uncertainty.However, our customers remain focused on digitizing the factory and securing the efficiency and productivity that will fuel their future growth. The move to the digital factory requires more high-performance signal processing and power management, additional sensors and more robust connectivity. These are all areas where ADI excels. On the automotive front, vehicle unit growth has stalled recently.But the real growth drivers, electric and autonomous vehicles, are in the nascent stages. Electric vehicles represent only 1% of worldwide sales, but industry reports suggest this will climb to more than 15% over the next decade or so. The powertrain in an electric vehicle opens the opportunity for us to address up to three times the content compared to combustion engines. Today, we enjoy the luxuries of level two autonomous vehicles, but the cars of the future will require higher precision and up to four times more sensors per car to provide the necessary level of safety for a fully autonomous vehicle.And it's not just about radar or cameras. We expect that these cars of the future will require LIDARs and IMUs as well. ADI is uniquely positioned to provide the necessary building blocks across all these sensing modalities, as well as the analog and mixed single processing, RF and microwave connectivity, algorithms and power management to make the autonomous vision a reality. In communications, carriers are looking to upgrade both the wireless networks and the optical backbone to deal with the ever-increasing deluge of data being created and transmitted.This additional data intensifies the need for spectral, space, thermal and cost efficiency. And with our comprehensive portfolio of software-defined mixed signal, RF, microwave and power management technologies, we're creating very compelling solutions for our customers as they upgrade 4G networks and begin the introduction of 5G systems. An important bridge between 4G and 5G is the introduction of massive MIMO radio systems. And ADI's software-defined transceiver technology is at their core.These upgrades to massive MIMO systems are just beginning today. And the increase in radio account expands our content opportunity by up to four times when compared to traditional 4G systems. This phase will be followed by network expansions to higher frequencies to increase bandwidth, as well as the upgrade of the optical backhaul and virtualization of the network to more efficiently move the data. This next wave will once again create the opportunity for ADI to address additional content, both in the radio, as well as in the optical network.We see these upgrades toward 5G as a multi-year cycle that's just beginning, and are expected to provide tailwinds to our business well into the future. And lastly, in healthcare, the dual impact of an aging global population and the pressing need to more economically and effectively manage wellness is driving continued investments in our products by our customers. Here we're complementing our high-end component franchise with highly integrated subsystems, thereby extending our addressable market to capture new levels of value. For example, in digital x-ray, we're creating highly integrated photons to bit subsystems that enable our customers to deliver high fidelity images at lower radiation dosages.Separately, ADI's deep expertise in vital signs monitoring and ultra-low power electronics enable clinical-grade performance under battery power, allowing us to deliver high accuracy, portable monitoring at virtually any point of use. Now in closing, as the saying goes, a rising tide lifts all ships, the true test of a company's strategy, execution and value is its performance during a low tide. Now we've chosen a strategy that focuses on innovation, diversity across technologies, markets and applications and continuous improvement across every aspect of our performance. And the results speak for themselves.We're confident that our ethos and heritage of innovation, leadership in high-performance analog, deep relationships with our customers and alignment to favorable macro trends positions us to create to continue to outperform, capture more value, expand our addressable market and deliver strong results for our shareholders. And so with that, I will hand it over to Prashanth, who will bring you through more detail. -- Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our first-quarter  . My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter, and we have now adopted ASC 606 or sell-in accounting.We have restated our historical financial statements to conform. And as Mike mentioned, we've also posted a two-year quarterly end-market look back for revenue on a sell-in basis. To normalize our growth rates and give you a like-for-like comparison, my prepared remarks and our Q&A commentary will exclude this extra week and will be on a sell-in basis, unless otherwise stated. Now onto the quarter, in the face of geopolitical uncertainty, we are pleased to report strong first-quarter results with revenue, operating margin and EPS all coming in above the midpoint of our guidance.Additionally, we are delighted to have increased our dividend by almost 13%, the largest increase since 2013. And we also raised our dividend growth target to 7% to 15% annually. This reflects our strong financial results, as well as our optimism regarding ADI's future. Before diving into the income statement, let me first cover the end markets.Our first-quarter B2B revenue increased 10% year over year, led by exceptional growth in the communication market, driven by ongoing momentum in 4G and the initial 5G deployments. The industrial market represented 47% of sales in the quarter and revenue was roughly flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Within this highly diversified business, revenue growth in healthcare, electronic test and measurement, aerospace and defense were balanced by weaker demand in factory automation and memory test. The comms market represented 22% of sales during the quarter and experienced very strong double-digit year-over-year growth, led by strength in wireless.This growth exceeded our expectations and illustrates the strong momentum ADI is experiencing in traditional 4G systems and in the early deployments of 5G massive MIMO. We see 5G as a multi-year upgrade cycle that is expected to deliver continued growth over the coming years. Our auto business represented 17% of sales in the quarter, and based on sell-through revenue, was essentially flat compared to the year-ago quarter. Overall vehicle unit weakness was offset by double-digit growth in BMS, growth in power management as we bring new products to market and extend our customer reach and ramping sales of A2B.The 6% year-over-year reported growth from our end-market breakout is primarily due to sell-in accounting as we moved some customers from direct to distribution during the quarter. And lastly, our consumer business represented 14% of sales in the first quarter. As expected, revenues declined year over year. However, portables declined less than expected.Now onto the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high-end of our guidance at approximately $1.54 billion, up 6% year over year. Gross margin came in at 70.3% and lower year over year due to end-market mix and lower utilization rates. OPEX in the quarter was $448 million, down slightly sequentially and below the midpoint of guidance, as we balanced our strategic investments with prudent discretionary spend.This translated to an operating margin of 41.2%, which was at the high-end of our guided range. Non-op expenses in the first quarter were $56 million, unchanged from 4Q, but lower than a year ago, due to our debt reduction of $1.2 billion over the past year. Our tax rate for the quarter was just above 14% and at the lower end of outlook of 14% to 16%. All told, adjusted diluted earnings per share from the first quarter came in above the midpoint of guidance at $1.33.Now moving on to the balance sheet, inventory dollars increased slightly sequentially, while days were flat at 117 compared to fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the coming quarters, we will begin to build bridge inventory ahead of the closure of our front-end and back-end facilities that we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost synergies. So we plan to modestly increase our inventory days temporarily until these closures are complete. Distribution inventory days were down, both sequentially and year over year and remain in our target range.CAPEX in the first quarter was $91 million or 6% of sales. For the full year, we anticipate CAPEX may run modestly higher than our 4% model due to the co-location of our product and business development teams and additional capacity to support future linear growth. This will be a temporary deviation from our long-term model. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion on a trailing 12-month basis.Over the past 12 months, we have returned 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. In the first quarter, we repaid $100 million of debt, paid $178 million in dividends and repurchased $227 million of our stock or roughly 2.5 million shares. Now onto guidance, which again with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses is also on an adjusted basis, excluding items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, our guidance is based on sell-in or POA accounting.For context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past three years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by about 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger. Second quarter revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $50 million. At the midpoint, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications in the aggregate to increase slightly year over year, led by the communications market.At the midpoint of guidance, we expect second quarter operating margin to be up slightly sequentially at 41.3%. Non-op expenses are expected to be basically flat sequentially, and we are planning for our tax rate to be toward the lower end of our previously guided range of 14% to 16%. Based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.07. All in, it was a strong quarter to kick off fiscal '19.And while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism and say that we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI. And with that, I'll turn over to Mike to start our Q&A. -- Thanks, Prashanth. OK. Before we move to Q&A, one last reminder from IR. Our growth commentary will be on a normalized 13-week basis and on sell-in, unless we otherwise state it.Now let's get to the Q&A. [Operator instructions] Operator, can we have our first question, please.[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. -- I just wanted to put your guide with respect to what the peers have reported and guided to. Is it fair to assume that it's really, the sell-in accounting change is one of the bigger factors in your Q-over-Q guide being different than your peers like Dixon and Maxim. -- No, Ambrish, I'm not sure why you'd conclude that. As I mentioned, we're not guiding point-of-sale anymore. We're on a sell-in basis. But the guide is at the $1,541 million midpoint of growth -- excuse me, at the $1,500 million midpoint.The guide should be on a year-over-year basis. If you were to take an assumption on flat inventory channel, you would still see a pretty strong sequential or year-over-year growth number there. -- Ambrish, just to give some context there. As Prashanth said in his prepared remarks, we build inventory in the first half of the year in '18 and this year, we're not planning to build as much. So that would actually be counter to what you said. -- Ambrish, if you take our outlook for the next quarter, 2Q, basically, our days in the channel are flat. So it's certainly not an inventory build or sell-in issue. We run the company on a sell-through basis. So I want to make that clear. -- Do you have a follow-up, Ambrish? -- I did. I just wanted to make sure I got that right. A bit longer-term, Vince, on the 5G versus 4G. Can you just help us understand what are the different dynamics architecture wise? And also the content gains that you expect? I know it's multi-flavor rollout, multi-year rollout, but how should we think about your positioning versus what it was in 4G? -- Yes. So the 4G build-outs are continuing. I think that will be the story for the next couple of years in terms of revenue contribution to ADI. But of course, 4G is being upgraded.We're adding massive MIMO, for example, to direct the energy and improve spectral efficiency. So I think we have a very high share at the present time in 4G and in the initial stages of 5G. And what we're seeing right now is, as I said, the 4G phase continues. I think there are multiple years left for 4G, it'll be the primary platform.But we're in the initial stages of 5G deployments. But really 5G has yet to materialize. When it comes to looking at the content, I would say, these new generations of 4G create four times more content value for ADI. And of course, when we move to 5G with higher frequency systems, the microwave systems and the densification of these massive MIMO systems, there is another bump that we expect to get in content there.And that's, by the way, before we add in the power management portfolio as well. So as I've said before, for every $1 of analog content, of mixed-signal content, there's at least $1 of power. And I'm pleased to say that we are at the early stages of attaching our LT power management portfolio to our four and 5G story as well.Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg from Stifel Nicolaus. -- First question, I'm intrigued by the investments you're doing in healthcare. I assume that up until now, that's really sort of a B2B business. But there seems to be a lot of things going on in the consumer side. So should we expect ADI to participate both in B2B and in consumer when it comes to healthcare? -- It's a good question. Well, most of what we're doing is, for example in the morgue point of use, the clinical grid vital signs monitoring, we are focusing very much on the higher end of the sensing and signal processing activity there. So we're not truly formed with ADI. We are focused on really solving the toughest problems and enabling consumers to wear new healthcare sensing technologies to predict and help monitor wellness and indeed recovery from health situations.So I would say that the way to think about this story is that we're going to be focused largely on more B2B type activities. -- Do you have a follow-up, Tore? -- That's very helpful. Yes. Question for Prashanth. Prashanth, you said, as you go through the manufacturing transition, your inventories are going to go up.Can you give us a sense for how much we're talking about here? Maybe you could give us a range on inventory base? -- Yes. Sure. Thanks, Tore. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had committed to some additional cost synergies relating to the shutdown of two sites that we acquired as part of the LTC acquisition.And these shutdowns should generate an incremental $100 million of cost synergies, all of which is in cost of goods. To help us through that transition, we're going to be needing to put a little bit more inventory internally under our balance sheets. And hard to kind of pinpoint too much at this early stage, but we're estimating around five days is what would be necessary to kind of carry us through bridging the closure of those two facilities. And then once those facilities are up and running, we'll bring that off.Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. -- Back to the sell-in accounting. So if I compare the new revenue profile with the old one, I noted considerable amount of revenue, particularly from industrial that moved from the second half of '18 to the first half. As you said, you built in the first and sold off in the second, and it shows up in the change. But it was a lot of revenue.Was the magnitude of this draw down bigger than what you would typically see in your ordinary patterns, just maybe given the stronger demand environment we have in the first half. I guess, maybe, just to put in other words, like, is the magnitude of the draw down in the channel that we saw in the second half bigger than what we would see? And is the channel right now leaner than when it ordinarily be in a normal second half? -- Thanks, Stacy. Let me break that into two pieces. So first, if you think back to last year, it was around summer that we were one of the first companies to indicate that we were beginning to see some challenge in the factory automation space, given what was going on, particularly with China. So being proactive on that, we began to constrain the amount of inventory going into the channel in preparation of the uncertain times ahead.So yes, last year, we did see a more significant kind of correction to inventory in the channel in the second half given the macro environment. So now setting that up for this year, now that we are on sell-in accounting, that creates for some tough comps in the first half. And again, as we move into the second half now, we'll also be lapping the softer business environment, as well as the inventory channel correction. So we do feel pretty good that the growth kind of gets better for industrial from here on forward.And in terms of what's in the channel, today, we're at about seven and a half weeks, and that's kind of right in the range that we guide to. As Vince mentioned, and this is important, we focused running the business on a POS basis. So the inventory in the channel for us is striking that balance in what is necessary to serve our customers, and it's less about kind of managing a particular revenue number. POS is what drives our decisions on what we put in the channel. -- Thanks, Stacy. Do you have a follow-up? -- I do. I wanted to ask about OPEX. So you were kind of flattish year over year in Q1. You're guiding kind of flattish in Q2.But at the same time, you're talking about continually investing into opportunities. So I guess, in particular, giving the current situation which does seem somewhat uncertain, how should we be thinking about OPEX growth maybe relative to revenue growth as we go through the rest of the year? -- Yes. I would say that, if you think historically, there has been a sort of a meaningful change in OPEX when we move from first quarter to second quarter. We told you in the las  call that that would not be the case this year, that our first quarter would be a little bit higher but that -- and there were some one timers that we talked about in the last call, but we were behind that. And as we move through the balance of the year, we're expecting OPEX to be relatively flattish.The biggest driver on frankly will continue to be variable compensation, which is designed to adjust the spend in line with the profit and the revenue growth. R&D today runs at about 18% of revenue, and we really consider that fully funded. So we will work within that envelope to deliver the product development needs that are required.Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar, Piper Jaffray. -- Gross margin came down, and it seemed that was just mix with sort of B2B sort of hurting a little bit and consumer coming in stronger. How are you expecting to manage the factory or the fab, and therefore, the utilization and gross margin in the coming few quarters? -- Well, first quarter, we had lower utilization. But we expect that utilization will increase in the second quarter and through the rest of our fiscal year here. So we'll, I think, keep pretty high level of utilization. And also, the 70.3% margins that we posted in the first quarter, as the mix toward industrial improves, we would expect also the gross margin to improve.So I think, utilization is in good shape across the company, and I think as well we are probably seeing what would be the lower point of the gross margin actively right now, and that will certainly improve as the industrial business improves. -- Harsh, your comments are correct. Just one clarification there. It was growth in consumer, but it was also the growth in communications. So both of them were responsible for the end-market mix.And do remember that we are left -- this was the current quarter where we have the typical holiday shutdown. So utilizations are at the lowest point typically over the holiday season. So with that, we'll go to our next caller. -- Do you have a follow-up, Harsh? -- Yes. So quick question on the automotive. So I got excited looking at your automotive number before realizing that there's a lot of sell-in stuff going on. Could you give us some color on how it held up if you back out the sell-in? And if you are unwilling to do that, maybe talk about, you had sort of laid out some targets on when you start to see some real growth, mid- to high-single digit kind of numbers in automotive a year or even slightly more than that out.How do you feel about that number -- that time frame? -- Great. Great, Harsh. Thank you. I'm going to do the first part and let Vince take the second part.So as I said in the prepared remarks, we moved some customers who were direct into the channel. So as a result, there was a little bit build and inventory associated with that. Normally that would not be revenue for us, remember that. And the growth, if you want to think about what is the auto growth due to sell-in, that would have been a flat number.So auto growth in the quarter, as we think about it, natural demand was flattish. And we would say that for the first half, we kind of expect that to be flattish because the second quarter is going to have the corresponding offset from what we -- from the inventory build that we had in the first quarter. Channel inventory overall was kind of minimal quarter over quarter. So auto was up, but the other markets were down.With that let me let Vince talk to kind of longer-term auto growth. -- Yes. So we're expecting through 2018, the ADI specific, the legacy ADI portion of our business grew in the high-single digits. The LT portion was in the lower single digits. But let me tell you a couple of things that we've been driving hard in our business.Or BMS, the battery management solutions that were legacy LTC, we've been growing that in double digits over the past three quarters or so. And we're looking at the remainder of this year, the full 2019 as a double-digit growth year in that particular area. And in fact, I think Prashanth indicated in his CAPEX remarks that one of the reasons we're increasing CAPEX is to enable us to put the equipment in place to get our products to market faster in that particular area and to put the test coverage that we need as well in our back-end. I'm glad to say as well that we're winning incremental power sockets in the automotive sector.We're bringing power to new customers. And we've seen just in this last quarter, in fact our power portfolio grew in the automotive sector on a year-over-year basis. Legacy ADI infotainment business continues to flourish, and we're winning many premium audio sockets. And also attaching LT power again to everything that we do in the automotive area.So we've just launched as well some very exciting high-resolution radar technology at the 77 gigahertz level, so that's yet to come. But all the early indications are that we're starting to get traction there. So I think we've many technologies and product areas that are well aligned with the critical themes in automotive around autonomy and electrification. And we now have the best portfolio in the industry to attack these opportunities.Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. -- The commentary on B2B up slightly, can you frame that, if you look it between comm, industrial and automotive, just kind of a rough sense of how you expect those markets to trend year over year? -- Sure. Craig, comm will lead that growth, I would say. Industrial will be down year over year. Remember, last 2Q was a very, very strong quarter.I think we grew double digits sequentially in 2Q. That was kind of our peak industrial revenue a year ago. It was a tough comp, plus we also talked about the inventory change in the channel year over year. Automotive is going to be down year over year, as we talked about the sell-in versus sell-through accounting.So for auto, I would think, look at basically first half '19 flattish versus first half '18. -- And that is flattish auto with unit -- with vehicle unit sales down. So we do recognize that that is a good accomplishment given the decline in vehicle production. -- So then comms will be another strong double-digit grower year over year. Pull that together, increases slightly sequentially. And that's even with, I'll recall, the offset of auto being because of the sell-in accounting. If you took that away, B2B is up probably 2%, 3% year on year. -- Got it. Appreciate the color there. And then, Vince, just a question. Understanding there's some near-term cyclical pressure on the industrial market, can you talk through just design engagements with customers and things that once you see some of the cyclical pressure ease, how that business could get kind of back on track? -- It's a good question, Craig. We have an opportunity pipeline now both on legacy ADI and LT legacy power products, in particular, that is at an all-time record high. So we're basically converting that pipeline across-the-board, and we've a broader and deeper position in the automation sector. We've extended our reach into electronic test and measurement, which complements our more vertically oriented memory test area quite well.And the energy sector as well is doing well for the company and on a year-over-year basis has been growing. So all the things we do around sensing, measuring, interpreting, powering and connecting, those technologies are getting used in more and more places in the industrial sector and in the aerospace and defense as well. So we have a bigger portfolio. We've got more sales and application resource out there, deeply engaging with our customers every day.So my sense is, if I were to put a target growth number on it, I think we have the opportunity to grow consistently in the mid- to high-single digit area over the coming five, seven years.Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis, Barclays. -- This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. Just want to cover something you guys mentioned early in the call. I think you said that you moved $80 million from comm to consumer. Could you describe what you're moving over and kind of the growth profile of that chunk of revenue? -- Tom, this mainly relates to prosumer business. So think of like Polycoms and that type of stuff for conference calls, those type of things we moved from comms, the legacy for Linear were in communications, we put those into consumer where ADI puts them, as prosumer typically is a GDP-plus business growth wise. -- It was customer mapping as we continue to finish the integration process with LTC. -- Yes. So it's basically the nonportable stuff, and it looks and feels like a B2B business. Lots of customers and products and longer product life cycles when compared to the portable area. So that's the change that's taking place. -- Do you have a follow-up? -- Yes. I guess, just moving on more toward the comm side. You guys were talking about how 4G is really still strong and you guys are seeing the four times content increase for massive MIMO ahead of what people are really excited about in 5G. Can you kind of talk about the timing of that? And how much legs, you think, are left of that before that 5G transition should that happen in the next couple of quarters? -- Well, different people have different definitions of what constitutes 4G and 5G. I would say anything that is 4G with a massive MIMO connected to it is 4.5G, some people call that 5G. So that's already in play, and that's one of the strongest growth drivers in our portfolio. And I think that will be the story for, at least, another 12 to 18 months.I think it's going to be the very advanced 4G technologies that are beginning to utilize that bridge technology to 5G, which is massive MIMO. I see true massive -- true 5G being a 2021, '22 introduction point. So I think -- you will see trials, of course, in the meantime of the classical microwave-driven 5G, but I think that's still a couple of years out.Our next question is from William Stein, SunTrust. -- First, I'd like you to remind us about the capital allocation strategy for the company. There was a dividend increase. Also taking a step back, you're now below two turns of net leverage. There was for a time a concern around leverage that's clearly behind us now.But the last two acquisitions you did, Hittite and Linear, I think, are proving very successful. And in the context of the broader capital allocation strategy, I'm hoping you might comment on your appetite for M&A, which has been, maybe gotten a little bit out of style in the last year or so, but I would suspect should still be on the top of ADI's mind given the success you've had? -- Well, the first call on our capital is to make sure that we invest to the fullest extent in building the greatest products and getting these products to market. So that's the first call. And we're investing, in fact our OPEX is at a record level this year, our fixed OPEX. And so that's the first call on capital.We have committed to returning all our free cash flow after debt repayment to our shareholders. That's the track we're on. We are very happy with where we are right now as a company with the combination of ADI legacy, Hittite and LT. So we're still integrating LT and creating the leverage that we know we can create with that franchise.So that's where we are right now. And we've been doing some tuck-in acquisitions over the last 12 months, we'll continue to do that, but I think, that's the way to think about it right now. -- Do you have a follow-up, Will? -- Yes. I'm wondering if you can comment on the degree to which you believe the trade conflict has been hurting your business. I think it's clear, there has been some effect, maybe not as much as others because, in particular, the comp strength, but to what degree you see that already embedded in orders? And what you think sort of the future holds if there is a trade agreement in regards to your backlog and your trend of business? -- Let me start and then let Vince add some more color. I just want to get to your question on orders. I know that's probably on many people's minds. January orders were stronger than December.Now that's not unusual for us, but it is a good sign, and that was strength in orders across all of our B2B markets. Now February has Chinese New Year, so there's a lot of noise in that. But going into the Chinese New Year, orders remain strong. And while it is a noisy metric, and we do -- but we do look at it, our four-week book to bill is higher than both our eight-week and our 13-week.But I do want to emphasize that is a very noisy metric, but for whatever, that's worth. -- I think that's fine, Prashanth.And our next question comes from John Pitzer, Credit Suisse. -- Both of mine are relative to the comms business. I guess, Vince, when I adjust for the extra week and the change in accounting, the comms business was up north of 40% year over year in the January quarter, just excellent results. But as you start to kind of lap the large numbers and hard compares, what do you think the sustainable growth rate in the comms business should be over a longer period of time? I guess, if you look at the last several quarters, you've grown revenue on a quarterly basis by almost $100 million. I'm wondering if you could help us break down the buckets of that growth, which means sort of massive MIMO, 5G, Hittite? And maybe to follow on to Will's question.There is some concern out there that perhaps you're seeing a pull-in from some of your Chinese customers relative to concerns about their ability to get parts or tariffs. Are you seeing any sort of pull-ins in these numbers or not? -- Well, I think, there probably is some. And I don't certainly think are natural in the numbers incidentally. But there is obviously some pull-in. There is anxiety around the current trade tension situation.But also remember, particularly in China, there are planned releases of advanced 4G systems and the trialing of 5G systems, so that's taking place. I think our story is dominated primarily by the fact that we have much more content than we've ever had historically in these systems of ever-increasing complexity. Off the top of my head, John, it's hard to give you a breakdown of what the individual pieces are in terms of the contribution from legacy ADI, Linear and Hittite. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and certainly in the Q&A here, we're beginning to see the early stages of LTC power being adopted.So the portfolio today is largely dominated by legacy ADI mixed signal. We're at the early stage of adoption of LT. And Hittite is a tremendous source of strength in the higher frequency products that connect to the antenna. And all that said, my expectation is with the content and with the expectations of our customers that that business will grow at double-digits for the next several years. -- And then Vince... -- Go ahead, John. -- We can take it off-line. Well, I tended to say on the four times content story, what percentage of your comps revenue does that content story cover? Or are you really kind of guiding that at some point in the future we can go back and look at a quarterly revenue run rate that's kind of four times what it was maybe two or three years ago? -- So at a high level, John, 2018 was really about share gains on traditional 4G. Doesn't really include that four times content. That four times content comment relates to, as you move to more radios and massive MIMO, the radios go up by 8x, the content opportunity for us up at 4x, and we're adding Linear power on to that. So that's really in the future.So at a high level, '18 is about 4G share gains, '19 and beyond will be about moving to massive MIMO and the four times content.Your last question comes from C.J. Muse, Evercore. -- I guess to follow-up on a handful of the previous questions. Your industrial business definitely proved more resilient than I think most of us were thinking coming in. And so just curious, how much of that do you think was a result of moving to sell-in versus your particular portfolio? -- I would say, none of that was really due to sell-in. Remember that industrial business largely goes through the channel. We have a very tough compare in the first half because in 2018, we built inventory in the channel, so that is primarily the industrial business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw growth in aerospace, defense, electronic test and measurement, which more than helped to offset the headwind we had in automation and memory test, which we've signaled some time ago.The book to bill is above parity. So a little bit lower than normal, but that's already reflected in our outlook. I mentioned orders have gotten better. So I think, Vince made the comment, we think we continue to grow from here. -- That's helpful. And I guess, as a quick follow up, I guess, more limited commentary on the consumer side, as I figured. What's the start there? How are you thinking about seasonality? And kind of given what you know today design win was, what that business can look like through calendar '19? -- Yes. I mean, 2Q is usually the low point of the year for that business, just given the demand there. And if you think about it, on last call, Vince highlighted that we think consumer will be down 10% to 20% in fiscal '19, and that's kind of what we're sticking to for outlook. -- And thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

all Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Analog Devices (ADI) reports results for the quarter ended January 2019. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 20, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This semiconductor maker is expected to pos  of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.51 billion, down 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.35% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Analog Devices, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Analog Devices would pos  of $1.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.55, delivering a surprise of +1.97%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Analog Devices doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n recent trading, shares of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $100.92, changing hands for $102.41/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 13 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Analog Devices Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $90.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $116.00. The standard deviation is $7.653.But the whole reason to look at the  ADI price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ADI crossing above that average target price of $100.92/share, investors in ADI have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $100.92 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Analog Devices Inc:

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power o  estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Analog Devices was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

In fact, the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce  . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Analog Devices has an Earnings ESP of +0.14% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's nex  is expected to be released on February 20, 2019.Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options begin trading today, for the February 2019 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new February 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $88.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $88.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $85.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $89.04/share today.Because the $88.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.39% return on the cash commitment, or 24.75% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $88.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $89.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $89.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $89.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.22% if the stock gets called away at the February 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $89.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $89.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

"or semiconductor stocks, 2018 turned out to be a forgettable year thanks to headwinds such as weak chip demand and the U.S.-China trade war. As of this writing, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector index has lost around 4% of its value in 2018, and it looks as if the market won't be picking up a lot of momentum in 2019 either.IHS Markit predicts that semiconductor sales will increase just 4% in 2019, down from 2018's estimated growth rate of nearly 15%. However,  (NASDAQ: ADI) has weathered the chip industry slowdown, with its stock flat so far this year, which showcases its resilience in the face of the broad market weakness.But it won't be surprising if Analog breaks out in the new year, as it is going after markets with a lot of growth potential, and also pays a nice dividend that it has been  the past 14 years. Let's see why this underrated chipmaker should be on your new year's shopping list.Image source: Getty Images.Analog Devices is coming off a solid year. The company's revenue shot up 19% in fiscal year 2018 (which ended on Nov. 3), while net income more than doubled on the back of impressive growth in its margins. Analog's $15 billion acquisition of Linear Technology (completed in March 2017) was the biggest catalyst behind this attractive financial growth.Analog spent handsomely on Linear because the latter complements its existing businesses. In fact, the combined company achieved $150 million in cost synergies in fiscal 2018, and it is now looking to save another $100 million in costs going forward by reducing its manufacturing footprint. But that's not the only upside that Analog is looking to achieve. CEO Vincent Roche, ""Given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we're increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC's revenue growth over the next few years. We exit 2018 in a stronger position than we've ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and indeed beyond.""For instance, Analog is now in a stronger position to tap the growing demand for semiconductors in the industrial sector. IHS Markit points out that after the Linear Technology acquisition, Analog became the second-largest industrial semiconductor provider, after  . That's a nice position to be in, as industrial semiconductor sales increased nearly 12% in 2017, and the industry is expected to keep growing at a compound annual growth rate of 7.1% through 2022.Not surprisingly, Analog Devices is going aggressively after this opportunity. It recently announced a range of solutions aimed at helping industrial equipment OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) move toward automation faster. For instance, Analog's condition-based monitoring system aims to improve machine productivity by reducing downtime in industrial and transport equipment. The chipmaker uses its sensor technology to monitor early signs of failure or fatigue, helping factory managers carry out preventive maintenance and boost productivity.These solutions will help Analog tap into fast-growing niches of the industrial semiconductor market, such as factory automation, which is expected to grow at 8.8% a year through 2025. This bodes well for Analog, as it gets half of its revenue from the industrial business.At the same time, its bottom line is on track to improve thanks to the higher-margin profile since the Linear Technology acquisition.Analog Devices exited 2018 with a gross margin of 68.3%, which is a massive jump from the prior-year period's 59.9%. Looking ahead, Analog's margin performance will improve further on the realization of more cost synergies.I have already mentioned that Analog has a solid dividend payout history, which is unlikely to change because the catalysts Analog enjoys should boost its bottom line. More importantly, the company is  all of its free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments, and that's an important reason its dividend payments have increased over the past year. data by Looking ahead, Analog's earnings are expected to get better, as evident from the chart below. data by It won't be surprising to see the company's free cash flow profile improving. This should allow it to sustain its dividend hikes and boost the yield that already sits at an impressive 2.22%, ahead of the tech sector's average yield of just 1.08%.Finally, the stock trades at just 15 times next year's earnings, which is half of the company's five-year average price-to-earnings ratio. So investors looking for a nice dividend-paying tech stock that will help them take advantage of secular growth trends in the semiconductor industry should definitely take a look at Analog Devices.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them!

In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed a 33% decline in consumer revenues year over year. Macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears are added concerns, which might hurt the company's top line. | Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader computer and technology sector include Generac Holdings Inc.  , SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc.  and Symantec Corporation  .

For more details on this strategy,  : Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (""Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,"" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.)

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.57 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Analog Devices, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Analog Devices would post earnings of $1.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of +4.79%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Analog Devices doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is slated to report third-quarter 2018 earnings on Nov 5, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the online travel company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.52%.The surprise history has been impressive in Booking Holdings' case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with average positive surprise of 13.39%.We observe that shares of Booking Holdings have gained 5.7% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the  's growth of 0.5%.Booking Holdings generates bulk of its revenues from international markets, wherein the agency model is more popular. This is reflected in the merchant/agency split of revenues, which was 20/73% in the second quarter.In the second quarter, agency revenues increased 21.4% sequentially and 10% from the year-ago quarter. We expect agency revenues to increase in the to-be-reported quarter as well, driven by strength across all its platforms.Merchant revenues are also expected to grow in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by strength across agoda.com and rentalcars.com. While agoda.com is likely to benefit from discounting in markets, rentalcars.com is expected to ride on continuous operational improvements.In the second quarter, merchant revenues were up 34.8% sequentially and 42.5% year over year.Room night growth is expected to improve in the quarter to be reported, driven by diverse inventory and brand recognition that tend to balance out the macro uncertainties related to any market, as well as growing competition from local and international players.In the last reported quarter, room nights volumes increased 12%. Also, rental car days increased 1% and airline tickets were up 5.3%.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Booking Holdings expects room nights booked to grow 6-9% and total gross bookings to increase 3-6% year over year (5-8% on a constant currency basis). The company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2,300-$2,360 million.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

 will report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 20, before the bell.The company's earnings surprise history has been impressive, as it surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with average of 6.64%.Moreover, the stock has gained 0.9% on a year-to-date basis against the  's decline of 14.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices, one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits, generated revenues of $1.57 billion, up 7.8% year over year and 3.9% sequentially. The strong growth was driven by robust performance from industrial, automotive and communications end-markets.Analog Devices has been benefiting from strength in industrial, automotive, consumer and communications markets, along with increased focus on innovation and operational execution. While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and fending off competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.In the fiscal third quarter, Automotive revenues jumped 6% from the year-ago quarter to $246.9 million. The automotive electronics market should continue to gain from consumer demand for added technology and features in new vehicles, along with the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles. Therefore, we expect automotive revenues to further increase in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for automotive revenues is pegged at $252 million.Also, the communications market should perform well in the quarter to be reported, driven by strength in the wireless segment. The accelerated build out of TD-LTE in China, continuing 4G network densification activities in the United States and expected deployments in Europe should benefit the communications segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for communications is pegged at $332 million.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for industrial and consumer is pegged at $803 million and $184 million, respectively.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings estimates. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Earnings ESP for the stock is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement. | We see a likely earnings beat for each of the following companies:NetApp, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.80% and a Zacks Rank #2.Semtech Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +1.64% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .VMware, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.55% and a Zacks Rank #3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

Notably, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61 million. The year over year growth was attributed to strengthening customer base of the company. Moreover, strong contributions from the company's memory customers drove the top line.For the third quarter, the company expects non-GAAP earnings to lie between 37 cents and 49 cents per share. Further, the revenues are projected to be in the range of $58-$64 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter. | Nova's diversified technology portfolio serving various types of customers remains its key growth driver and is expected to aid the to-be-reported quarter results. Further, its strong presence in China is a major catalyst.Further, the company's expanding footprint in the front-end semiconductor supply chain remains positive. Moreover, Nova's strengthening memory portfolio and enhancements in the 3D NAND market are boosting its presence in the semiconductor industry. These factors are likely to aid its primary growth drivers..Additionally, the company's increasing foundry spending on Logic node below 7-nanometer will continue to aid growth in the orders received.Furthermore, its robust metrology solutions portfolio comprising of OCD metrology and integrated X-ray metrology offerings are likely to continue aiding its momentum in the memory space.Also, growing adoption of Nova's latest metrology solutions - i550 integrated metrology, T600 NMSR standalone, VeraFlex III plus XPS and the Nova Fleet software engines are expected to drive the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the sluggishness in the memory spending globally remains a concern for the company's business growth.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

"Traders are running away from semiconductor stocks today, as  (NASDAQ:  ) warns that demand may be ebbing. This will create an enormous opportunity for investors. TI, as it's known, said it earned $1.57 billion -  - on revenue of $4.26 billion during the third quarter of its fiscal year, handing $1.8 billion back to TXN shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.The numbers were  , but what traders wanted to talk about was  of CEO Rich Templeton, who said the company was heading into a softer market, that demand was slowing. Anyone who knows trade should have expected this. American chips and designs have long crossed the Pacific to be turned into low-cost PCs and devices by Asian manufacturers for a grateful world. The Trump trade war threatens to interrupt this profitable trade.The trade war may be the dumbest global conflict to break out since interlocking alliances started World War I, but hopefully, the damage can be contained this time.Besides, chip demand always ebbs and flows. It's a cyclical business. New products become mature, and, while designers think of newer products, demand can ebb, backing up supply chains. This has been true since the industry's birth in the 1960s. But while things readjust, there are bargains to be had.TI's fall of 6% in early trade Oct. 24 dropped the price-earnings (P/E) ratio of TXN stock below 22, and it's selling at just six times its last year's sales. Other chip stocks are also falling in price, like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).  (NASDAQ:  ), which is now well ahead of  (NASDAQ:  ) in manufacturing capability, is trading at levels not seen since July 2017.Few stocks have been hit as hard as  (NASDAQ:  ), now down over 40% from its May high. At under $38 per share, it is trading at just 3.3 times last year's earnings, and at just 1.3 times its 2018 revenue of $30 billion.That's because past downturns hit memory chips (commodity products with little differentiation) especially hard. Micron has been driven to the wall twice by tech recessions, but it had $6 billion in cash on the books at the end of August, and this is not the first rodeo for CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who ran Sandisk until its sale to  (NASDAQ:  ) in 2016, What's different this time for the semiconductor space? Not much. Just a supercycle in which chips start becoming standard in thousands of previously inert devices, replacing switches in thermostats and traffic lights, controlling maintenance schedules for factories and airplanes, and letting your car drive itself, among other things.This transition in computing, from something you use overtly to something built into the background of daily life, is just getting started, amid predictable hand-wringing over security and other issues. Personally, I'm looking forward to new robot overlords, knowing they'll be doing all sorts of rote work, allowing people to get on with the creative ""wet work"" we're best at.Every ebb in chip stocks leads to an opportunity for longer-term investors. Investors should let the current chip panic wash through trader accounts, and then look to pick up some bargains. I like Micron, I like TXN stock; and if you don't know what to get, the  (NYSEARCA:  ) is currently trading at its low for the year.

(NASDAQ: ADI)Q4 2018 Nov. 20, 2018, Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 , which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web.I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!Now on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.Today's commentary about ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal '18 financial results will be detailed further in our 10-K, which we expect to file next week. Our comments today about ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 financial results and short-term outlook will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results.Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules, which we've posted under the Quarterly Results section at investor.analog.com.Okay with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince? -- Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone.Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI had another excellent quarter to cap off what was an exceptional year for the company. We once again hit a high water mark by achieving record revenue of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expanded operating margins to 43% and delivered $1.55 of diluted earnings per share.Looking at the full year now, revenue surpassed $6 billion for the first time. Growth was led by our B2B markets that increased well into the double digits year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased more than 20% year-over-year and, most notably, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. This robust cash generation enabled us to continue investing in the future of our business, rapidly reduce our debt by over $1.5 billion during the year, and return cash to our shareholders.As we outlined on the last call, going forward we plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments. In fact, we've returned $10 billion to our shareholders since 2005 through dividends and share repurchases.Beyond being a strong year financially, it was also a year of exceptional business progress for ADI also. So, I'd like to spend a little time describing our progress in 2018 and show how specifically it positions ADI for continued strength in 2019 and indeed beyond.Firstly, we made tremendous progress in the integration of LTC using our best of both approach. Employees across the entire organization are unified and working toward a common goal of delivering long-term profitable growth. Our R&D teams have synergized product roadmaps and development activities and are busily extending the cutting edge of analog, mixed-signal power, and sensors to deliver impactful solutions to our customers.Our combined sales force has made really great strides in building and converting our opportunity pipeline. In fact, our revenue cross selling opportunity has doubled in value since our Analyst Day across large customers and also in the broad market.During the year, we successfully achieved our initial $150 million of cost synergies. In addition, as previously announced, we're optimizing our internal manufacturing footprint, reducing our cost basis by another $100 million while enabling a more agile operation that is positioned to capture new growth upside.All that said, given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships, we're increasingly confident in our objective to double LTC's revenue growth over the next few years. In short, we've created an industry-leading product portfolio and team of analog, Rf, and power engineers with capabilities that range from sensor to cloud, from DC to 100 gigahertz, and from nanowatts to kilowatts.We exit 2018 in a stronger position than we've ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and indeed beyond. In addition to our preparedness, our confidence is grounded in a few externalities that transcend any potential short-term uncertainty in 2019. Namely, immutable technology macro trends that are creating secular tailwinds for ADI; ADI's analog expertise between the physical and digital domains becomes ever more critical to our customers' business success; and simultaneously, our customers are partnering more deeply with us to get the full benefit of our technology capabilities and product solutions to enable them to meet the innovation demands of their customers.And we're very well aligned with these externalities and have been making strong progress during position success in 2019 and beyond. For example, in the wireless communication sector, you may have seen recent press around deployments of 5G massive MIMO beginning in Korea. ADI's software-defined transceivers are enabling those deployments, and this is just the beginning. Many other global carriers are expected to deploy 5G massive MIMO over the coming years.Much of the innovation of 5G systems is taking place in the radio subsystem. Given the increasing demands for spectral space thermal and cost efficiency, our comprehensive portfolio of software defined, mixed signal, Rf, microwave, and power management technologies will enable ADI to create even more compelling solutions for our customers in the years ahead. These massive MIMO-enabled radios continue an eight times increase in radio channels, representing a significant growth opportunity for ADI, and the opportunity to capture potentially up to four times the content when compared to current 4G solutions.I should note also that, in addition, power management's attached design winds in this area are just beginning. The progress thus far leads us to believe that our power portfolio will continue to provide tailwinds for us in communications in 2019 and in further years. And indeed, massive MIMO is just a stepping stone millimeter waved-based future generations. Here, carriers will look to increase the radio channel count up to 512 channels per radio, and we are very well positioned to once again solve these immense radio challenges with our comprehensive cutting edge portfolio. So, I believe we're really in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle in this particular space.So, now turning for a moment to the industrial sector, here the digital factory envisioned by Industry 4.0 is expected to increase productivity and lower costs. ADI has the heritage, the demand expertise, and the most comprehensive set of technologies and capabilities to deliver the required level of precision and robustness our customers need. For example, we're building beyond our traditional strength in precision control isolation of power products by adding communications technologies such as industrial grade deterministic Ethernet and sensors in areas such as depth, motion, and vibration, which more than triples our content opportunity and expands or addressable market.In automotive, FY '18 was a year of really solid progress, and I have increased conviction that we're on the right path to return to our target growth rate of at least high-single digits annually. Growth in our cabin electronics business has accelerated to a double-digit growth rate this past year, driven mainly by our long-term strength in audio processing. And our future is equally bright here. We're adding new vectors to our audio processing foundation like A-to-B and C-to-B media transport technologies, and we're attaching our power management portfolio in these engagements, as well, positioning us for continued strong growth in this particular subsector.On the active safety side of the business, high-speed signal processing technology is required to deliver ever increasing levels of precision in level 3-plus autonomous vehicles. Here, ADI's radar, LiDAR, and IMU solutions, coupled with power management, are strengthening our position across nearly all self-driving programs. And as in the case with Baidu, our customers are relying on ADI to achieve their vision of fully autonomous vehicles.In the electrification application area, we've made stellar progress in strengthening our BMS solutions in FY '18. Our current generation delivers up to 20% more miles per charge compared to the competition and extends the battery's useful life. We are now sampling our next-generation solution, which provides another efficiency and performance leap while adding additional safety features. Beyond that, the subsequent generation of our multi-generational roadmap includes architectural innovations that will change the way the BMS problems of power density, accuracy, and weight are solved in the future.And finally, I'd like to say a few words about our healthcare business and progress. Revenue in this market has increased at a double-digit growth rate over the past five years, and I believe it's really just getting started. In areas such as remote patient monitoring and digital x-ray systems, ADI's expertise in high-performance sensing, signal processing, and power control is ever more critical to our customers.For example, in the area of digital x-ray imaging, several years ago we made a pivot to a domain-inspired approach to solve our customers most difficult problems. We've leveraged our strong heritage of high-end component building blocks and have pushed the innovation curve to new levels to create highly integrated subsystems, from photons to bits for example.These solutions have simplified an intensely complex problem by reducing our customers design challenges while lowering radiation dosage and simultaneously increasing image fidelity. We have thereby extended our addressable market to capture new levels of value. And in general in the healthcare area, I believe that economic needs and new technology adoption are converging to enable a new vein of growth in the future for ADI.So, in closing, I've put forth the constructive scenario here today, and while some may be a bit skeptical given the present macro uncertainty and geopolitical fears that beset our world, our confidence, I believe, is very well founded. We have a diverse business across customers, products, and applications that positions us to succeed and excel in any macro climate. We've added enormously to our cutting-edge technology portfolio during the year, and we've deepened our customer engagements. So, we're in a position to capture the upside while being agile enough to weather any perturbations in the marketplace.And amid an environment of increasing change and complexity, we continue to leverage our greatest asset: Our people who continuously push the edge, learn and adapt to create evermore innovative solutions for our customers each and every day, which ultimately drives returns for our shareholdersAnd so with that, I'd like to hand it over to Prashanth. -- Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q4 '18 earnings call.As usual, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.We wrap up 2018 with another record-setting quarter. Revenue at $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.55, and we converted this growth into strong cash flow, generating over $2 billion on a trailing 12. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets.Our fourth quarter B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The highly diverse industrial end market represented 49% of sales in the quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. Most sectors increased compared to the year-ago quarter, led by strength in instrumentation, healthcare, aerospace, and defense. As expected, this growth was moderated by slower demand in factory automation, mainly related to China.The comms market, which represented 22% of sales in the fourth quarter, increased once again at a double-digit rate year-over-year, driven by strong performance in both the wireless and wired markets. Growth in our wireless business was broad based and accelerated as continued momentum in our 4G business was augmented by early deployments of massive MIMO. We expect this to carry into 2019 and beyond as 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI.Our auto business represented 15% of sales in the quarter and increased at a low single-digit rate year-over-year. Growth was led by cabin electronics and the BMS application.And lastly, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the fourth quarter. As expected, revenues declined year-over-year; however, portables declined less than expected.Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance at approximately $1.6 billion, increasing 4% year-over-year. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 30 bps year-over-year and were flat sequentially.OpEx in the fourth quarter was $452 million, and at approximately 28% of revenue, well within our target of sub-30. And finally, op margins were record at 43%.As we continue to deliver, non-op expenses in the fourth quarter declined to $56 million, and with our full-year true-up, our Q4 tax rate was approximately 8%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter came in above the midpoint at $1.55.Now moving on to the balance sheet, inventory increased 4% sequentially, and days were 114 in the quarter, relatively flat from third quarter. Disty inventory declined sequentially and exited the year right in line with our target of six to eight weeks.We generated free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, or 35% of sales over the trailing 12 months. And as of yesterday's closing price, our free cash flow yield is 6.8%. During the quarter, we repaid $225 million of debt and paid $179 million in dividends. And as we outlined in our last earnings call, we have resumed our share repurchase program now that our leverage is sub-two. As of yesterday, we have purchased nearly $260 million worth of shares.CapEx in the fourth quarter was $86 million, and we expect it to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales for 2019.Before I move on to guidance, I want to remind you that in the January quarter, we will adopt a new rev rec standard, ASC 606, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are among the last few SEC registrants to do so due to the timing of our fiscal year. We have historically deferred revenue and the related costs for shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell their products to their customers. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we will recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributor.We plan to provide a historical quarterly end market revenue lookback under the new standard with our first quarter 2019 earnings release, meaning you will see changes in our historical growth rates, as they will reflect revenue from shipping into distribution versus shipping out. But for context, during 2018, the change in channel inventory for the year was pretty minimal, as channel inventory increased in the first half and was reduced in the second half of the year. On average, over the past three years, channel inventory impacts annual revenue by plus or minus 1%, while quarterly variances could be and have been larger.Now on to guidance, which, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude the items outlined in today's release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter. So, all of my comments on revenue growth and our commentary during the Q&A session will exclude this extra week. So, we are normalizing our growth rates to give you a like-for-like comparison.First quarter revenue is expected to be $1.51 billion at the midpoint on both the old and new rev rec methodology. To be clear, we are forecasting a midpoint of $1.51 billion on both a sell-in or new ASC 606 standard, as well as a sale-through basis because we expect minimal change in channel inventory during the first quarter.At the midpoint of guidance, we expect total revenue to increase 7% year-over-year on a sell-through basis. We expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto, and comms in the aggregate to increase low-double-digits year-over-year, led by the communications market. This would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets.Under the new rev rec method, year-over-year growth would be approximately 4% at a company level and at high-single-digit rate in the B2B markets for the first quarter. We are planning for gross margins to be approximately 70.8, lowered sequentially due to the normal shutdowns around the holidays, as well as business mix. We are expecting operating expenses to be around $450 million at the midpoint. This is down slightly sequentially and does include some one-time items, so you will not see the usual lift going into Q2. We expect op margins in the first quarter to be approximately 41%. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $56 million, and our tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%. This tax rate is slightly higher than our previous outlook due to new IRS guidance released in September.Based on these inputs, diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be $1.28 plus or minus $0.07.Before moving onto the Q&A session, I want to inform you that this will be the last quarter we're going to be providing gross margin and OpEx guidance. This will be the only change, as we will continue to provide the other items for outlook, including operating margin. This does not change our long-term operating model that we discussed that our Analyst Day of 70% plus gross margins and op margins in the range of 39% to 45%. We are making this transition as it aligns to the way we manage the business. That is, we focus on driving profitable growth and operating margin expansion.So, all in, it was a terrific quarter to cap off a very successful year for ADI. And while we are mindful of the economic uncertainty around us, I will echo Vince's optimism that we enter 2019 equally excited about the opportunities ahead.And with that, let me turn it over to Mike to lead our Q&A session. -- Thanks, Prashanth. Okay, before we move to Q&A, I want to remind everyone of a couple points. First, we are moving to sale and accounting starting first quarter '19. And second, the first quarter of 2018 was a 14-week quarter. As such, our commentary around expected growth in the first quarter 2019 will exclude these two factors. In short, our growth commentary will be on a 13-week sell-through basis.Okay, let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question, and after our initial response, we will give you an opportunity for a followup question. Jennifer, can we have our first question please.For those participating by telephone dial in, if you have a question please press * and the number 1 on your phone. If your question has been answered and you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the # key. If you are listening on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking your question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. --  . Yes, thank you. Good morning and congratulations on the results in a tough environment. The first question is on the industrial business. So, obviously it's very diversified, and I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit on what your customers are seeing there as far as the slow down. Are they sort of in a wait-and-see based on what the macro political situation is, or are they perhaps a little bit more optimistic about '19? Just trying to gauge how your industrial base is feeling right now. -- Thanks, Tore. Well, I think I've talked with quite a few customers, both domestically here in America and internationally over the last quarter, quarter and a half, maybe quarters. In the atmosphere of the macro uncertainty driven by trade war rhetoric and so on, so forth, and the impacts of the tariffs, I'd say generally speaking customers are remaining optimistic, though there is obviously concern which is dampening enthusiasm for laying down CapEx and taking a long-term view to demand.So, I would say at this point in time what we're seeing though is cancellations are at kind of a normal rate and lead times for the most part are pretty normal. So, in the industrial market itself, we're seeing pockets of softness. I would say in the automation part of our business, it's largely softening in China. We are seeing strength, for example, in the electronic tests and measurement side of our business. Obviously, healthcare has remained strong for the company. I think aerospace and defense is also an area of continued growth and some good acceleration there over the last quarter or two.So, I think that provides you some color. From our point of view, Tore, we've obviously been investing heavily from an R&D and customer engagement standpoint over really the past decade. So, I think for ADI, we're better positioned than we've ever been in that market. It is our number one focus, I would say. It's broad, it's deep. It's got many thousands of products, many thousands of customers associated with it. So, we're optimistic about our capacity to continue to grow content and to gain share as we have been doing in '18 and beyond. -- Thank you, Tore. Do you have a followup? --  . Yes. Thank you, Vince. That was very helpful. So, I had a clarification question. You mentioned now with the synergies between Linear and ADI, I think you used the word double. I'm just wondering does that mean the revenue synergies are now up to $2 billion, or is it...If you could just clarify that statement. Thanks. -- I think back in '17 when we had our Analyst Day, we were talking at that point in time about our visibility and confidence toward a billion dollars. So, yeah, we're well above that now and looking at continuing to grow, and we're certainly confident that we've doubled that synergy number over the past year and a bit. --  .  -- Honestly, I would [crosstalk] a bit why we're so confident we can double the growth of Linear as that pipeline expands. Okay, thank you. Can we take our next question, please?Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask you questions. Can you guys hear me? -- Yes, hear you fine. -- Pardon me, Vince. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congratulations on the strong results. Vince, just on the comms sector, you had mid 20% year-over-year growth last quarter. You just put up almost 30% growth this quarter. You did highlight some of the drivers there. I'm wondering if you could dissect that growth a little bit. I know that you were really positive about the backlog you had with Hittite now, but it was under sort of your control from that M&A long product cycle design. To what extent has Hittite helping to drive this growth? And I guess are you at all concerned that some of this growth might be pull-ins from China trying to get these parts before the trade war escalates and potentially not being able to get these parts, just given how important massive MIMO and 5G are? Maybe you can help allay some of those concerns and just give us a little bit more detail there. -- Yeah. Thanks, John. Good question. So, let me start with the latter part of your question first. I don't get any sense that there's any form of tension or panic buying by our Chinese customers to get ahead of any tariffs or trade war concerns. Remember, as well, what we're seeing now is an accelerated build-out of I would say enhanced 4G and moving into the early stages of 5G. That's a multiyear process anyway, no matter what. So, what I'm seeing is a good balance between what we see as the increasing demand from the carriers and I would say the supply from our customers to meet the carrier's demands.When you put the whole thing together, we're looking at '19 being another year of double-digit growth. We have -- as I said, we've got 4G tailwinds, and that's driven by content gains we've been making over the last three years I'd say. Hittite incidentally -- just to give you a little bit of a benchmark here. When we acquired Hittite, it was roughly a $270 million trailing 12-month revenue company. The Hittite portion of our business is well over $400 million at this point in time, and isn't just communications. It's where microwave and those radiofrequency technologies are used in aerospace and defense other parts of the instrumentation industrial market.So, I think when you put the massive MIMO addition to 4G, or 5G as some people call it, and the early stages of 5G, that gives ADI a tremendously increased opportunity value over 4G. As I said in the prepared remarks, my sense is that we've got a four-times content improvement as 5G begins to ramp up here. And that by the way doesn't include -- we're not including any specific targets for LT in that number, but there's a huge cross-selling opportunity. We're beginning to go to production with power designs at this point in time. So, I think the tailwinds are strong and ADI's content has grown. Our portfolio has never been stronger. So, that's what we're seeing. I think it's a share gain story for ADI. -- Thanks, John. Do you have a followup? -- Yeah, just quickly guys. I hate to bring it up because it's such a small percentage of the revenue and the growth drivers, but you have historically just given us some color on the consumer segment and how we should be thinking about that, especially given the different launch times of flagship handsets. How do we think about consumer going into the January quarter? -- Well, looking into '19, we started the year off a bit stronger given the content that we have in some of the older platforms. All that said, we're still expecting that consumer will decline somewhere between 10% to 20% on the portable side in '18, while the prosumer part of our business which looks a lot more like a B2B sector is continuing to perform well for the company. So, I think the way to look at this, John, after this year's growth, growth will be determined by essentially new sockets, either what we win or what we lose. That will determine ultimately what happens I think after '19. But as always, we're optimistic about where we're playing in consumer, and we'll continue to be selective in the areas where we target. We're always seeking to increase diversity of application and customers. So, I think that's the snapshot of consumer at this point. -- John, we're looking for a 7% increase on a sell-through basis for the consolidated company and 12% for B2B. So, you should be able to impute the numbers you need for consumer. -- Thank you, guys. -- Thank you, John. We'll go to our next question.Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. -- Good morning, Craig. -- Good morning, thank you. Vince, can you just expand on the comment around the confidence in automotive returning to kind of high-single digits. And then if you're able to frame it, I know there are some A-B programs that may help in the coming years, as well as kind of BMS, but just any additional details would help. -- Thanks, Craig. Well, first and foremost, cabin electronics -- that part of our business has done very well during '18, and we're well positioned for more growth in '19. So, the growth in that area was double digits in '18. And yes, the A-B application space is growing for the company. We've added this new media transport modality, as well, that we call C-B. And we're also now getting the benefit of adding LTC's silent switcher technology internal some of these sockets, as well. So, we're at the early stages of an up-ramp in our power business there.I think, as well, it was well publicized during the year that we had some troubles with our battery management solution technology, but I think we've really turned the corner, particularly in the second half of '18. In the second half, we achieved double-digit growth, and we expect '19 also to be a double-digit growth performer for ADI.So, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as well, we're sampling our next-generation BMS. And we've got some very interesting architectural innovations, as well, coming on the back of that that will change the way these systems are designed and implemented in the electrification activity.On the sensing side, again, I've talked about some of this in the prepared remarks. Across radar, we're sampling our 77 gigahertz image quality radar. We have a very interesting and growing diversified pipeline in the LiDAR sector that combines both LT and ADI mixed-signal technologies. Many customers are starting to use our IMU, the internal management units, in the kind of L3-plus autonomous driving area.So, I think we have continued to accelerate during '18 in terms of stabilizing BMS and starting to get back to a growth trajectory and a lot of exciting things going on in autonomous vehicles, as well. So, hopefully, Craig, that frames it up for you. -- Thanks, Craig. We're going to ask you to move to one question and no followup given the interest of time. Can we have our next question, Jennifer?Our next question is from CJ Muse with Evercore. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess more of a cyclical macro question. You talked about seeing some softness in China. Curious if you're seeing a softness anywhere else, particularly as you think about strong US dollar and potential impact to emerging market demand. Would love to hear your thoughts cyclically where you might be seeing other pockets of weakness, if at all. -- Thanks for the question, CJ. So, from a geographic perspective, what I'm going to talk about here is based on design in revenue, so what's happening in each region from an innovation design standpoint. I'd say as we've come out of the year, all markets have increased year-over-year. Growth was led by China. I'd say looking at the sequential trends geographically, most markets were slightly up or a little down, and no big moves one way or another to report there. Industrial was up year-on-year. It was a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. Automotive was up year-on-year, again a little weaker quarter-on-quarter. But we believe that was related primarily to macro effects.There's SAR, China, this new testing modality that's being adopted in Europe. But we expect it to come back in the first quarter to our target. Communications, across the board all the primary geographies in which we're strong in communications were up very, very big on a year-on-year basis and also sequentially. That broad-based strength was led by China, as well as the EU particularly in the communications area.So, hopefully that gives you a sense for the atmosphere on the geographic basis. Prashanth, do you want to add anything? -- CJ, I would just add that remember we think about our geographic revenue based on where activity is designed. So, when we think about from a market standpoint, I mentioned factory automation was one that was seeing some softness. Automated test equipment was the other area we were seeing some softness. But outside that, really the rest of industrial has been staying in growth mode. So, that's what's forming our confidence for the Q1 outlook. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, CJ. We'll move to our next question.Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you guys have noticed any shifting of the supply chain, manufacturing out of China into other areas, and if that is impacting your own business? Thank you. -- I don't think there's anything really of note. First off, we're not so impacted by the tariffs, but there are some signs that our customers are trying to work around the cost impact of the tariffs. I think there are some passing on of the costs to end customers. And also a very small amount -- at least from our perspective, I'd say a very small amount of mitigation by our customers by moving to areas not affected by the tariffs when it comes to manufacturing their products. But I think it's very, very de minimis at this point in time. -- Mark, I think we're probably more familiar with our specific production, and what we're seeing is customers looking at supply chain changes that will allow them to maybe avoid staging products in the US that would then get further assembled and have those go directly to other countries where the assembly happens, and thereby avoiding the tariffs. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Mark. We'll move on to our next question.Our next question is from Hi. Thank you very much. Vince, I just want to make sure I understood your comments about the slowdown. Some of it you're characterizing it as a near-term uncertainty. You did talk about cancellations. Can you just help us understand what the order rates were doing as you were entering the current quarter? And then more importantly, what are the factory loadings going to look like at ADI. Structurally, the company is a lot more profitable than in the past cycles. Just help us understand the playbook if we were to go into a deeper downturn. Thank you. -- I'll take some of those and, Vince, you can add some pieces. So, let me take factory utilization. Certainly, we're headed into the holiday season, so our factory utilization is normally unaligned a bit for those that are impacted by Thanksgiving and then again for the Christmas/New Year period. So, utilizations are coming down, but not necessarily linked to changes in the demand environment beyond our original planning areas.In terms of booking activities, certainly our industrial business is seeing book-to-bill below parity, and it's been a while since we've seen that. But as I mentioned, we see most of that being heavily weighted from the two segments factory automation and automated test equipment.Order activity has stabilized from where it was. Now, I don't think we have the wherewithal to call the bottom here, but I'm just giving you the facts that we certainly saw an improvement in October versus what we saw in September. -- So, I think, Ambrish, another little bit of color. So, I would say for the most part, what we're seeing is really a pause rather than any...We're not seeing cancellations as such. I think it's a pause. It's the macro uncertainty that's causing customers to be a little cautious. Lead times for the company are really normal, and I would say, as I've just said, cancellations are normal.And just to give you a little more depth of color on that. So, the legacy ADI is well within the normal range of supply chain metrics. In other words, greater than 90% of our portfolio is shipping within the normal four to six-week window that we're inclined to report. LT is a little more mixed. We've had some I would say tightening of supply. Demand has been strong, and supply has been a little tight.But we've been investing aggressively and putting in place new capacity, in fact, over the last couple of quarters to support not just today's shortfalls, but also to support the future growth that we're expecting and increasingly optimistic about. So, the book-to-bill is, as Prashanth said, is just a little bit of parity on the side B2B side, driven largely by industrial. But I think the book-to-bill that we've given or that we're seeing is very supportive of the guidance that we've put out there. -- Thank you, Ambrish. Next caller, please.Our next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the strong results. A bigger picture question for you, Vince, is I think you said that the guidance would imply the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth in your B2B business, a very impressive track record for sure. As I go back in my model, that's the longest stretch of double-digit growth I can find at any point in time. So, I guess two points on that. How much of that do you think is company specific share gains, target investments, et cetera, versus a cyclical uplift, and how do you view the sustainability of the growth rate or even the target growth rate for your B2B segment? -- Yes, there are a lot of very good questions there, Ross. So, I'd say -- I mean it's very hard to parse out precisely what is market, what is ADI. Clearly, we as a company have -- we retooled the entire strategy of the company eight, nine, 10 years ago to focus very, very heavily on the B2B area. In fact, we're spending today 95% of our R&D in the B2B spaces, and most of our customer engagement activities, as well of course, are in the B2B areas. So, the addition -- the added R&D focus on the legacy ADI portfolio in the B2B area, the addition of Hittite and now LTC, where LTC was largely focused on B2B, I think positions the company well.We have been taking share, and that I'm sure of, and I believe we will continue to gain share. And of course, we were aided by favorable macro trends I think generally speaking. PMI has been positive for the last several quarters, and GDP has been strong. So, obviously the environment is strong, but I think ADI's is executing in a more focused, more intense way, as well, in capturing the opportunity.So, we believe, again, that B2B will increase within our, I think, more moderated growth range. We've said that for the long term, that if we can grow our B2B business kind of two to three times GDP, we would be content on ongoing basis. And that's my sense for '19, as well, barring any macro cataclysm that, we're going to that kind of growth rate in the coming year. -- Thank you. -- Jennifer, we'll move to our last question, please.And our final question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the good results. Just a question on the competitive landscape. You mentioned massive MIMO is a strong area of growth for you. Xilinx has also been talking their RFSoC product. I'm wondering how do you see the competitive landscape shaping up and what's your visibility and designments on next-general 4G and then 5G? -- So, I think first off there are many, many solution variants out there between the antenna and the bit stream so to speak. We have the strongest portfolio of technologies, right from the antenna down into the bit stream area. So, as I said earlier, as we move into the 5G -- the early stages of 5G here, we're looking at potentially four times the content availability compared to the classical 4G that we've been part of over the last five to seven years.When we get into the millimeter wave side of things, again, we've got the broadest portfolio. We can architect in a very flexible way to all the various customer needs. So, as 5G millimeter wave comes in, we're looking at potential gains of eight, 10-plus in terms of potential content, just given the channel count on the radio transceivers, which by the way is where most of the innovation is taking place in these 5G systems, at least until they virtualize in the early '20s or so.So, there are kind of three of four major building blocks on these base stations these days. There's the classical transceiver. There's the massive MIMO addition. There's all this power technology that we can bring to bear now, as well, for our customers. And then there's the digital baseband, the digital front end. And we're innovating not just in the analog space, but we're also pushing the boundaries incidentally on the digital side. And those boundaries, they blur, they shift, they ebb and they flow over multiple generations. But in our software-defined transceivers, for example, we've taken a significant amount of digital content and combined it with our converter technologies and our radio interface capabilities and dramatically reduced the footprint of the radio and cut the power levels down, as well.So, those are all important answers to very, very critical problems that our customers have. So, my sense is over the next say five years until we get into millimeter wave, we're looking at a potential content increase of three to four times, and then it's a question of how many radios deploy. But we're very, very well positioned from the content and architectural coverage standpoint. -- Thank you, Vivek. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website, and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found at the Quarterly Results section of our website. We look forward to seeing you this quarter at Credit Suisse Conference and the BMO Conference in the coming weeks.

 is scheduled to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 31.Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.27%.In the last reported quarter, Camtek posted non-GAAP earnings of 13 cents per share, which increased 116.7% year over year and 8.4% sequentially. The figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues increased 34% year over year and 11.7% sequentially to $30.5 million. The company also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30 million. Top-line growth was driven by strong performance of the company across all the end markets, especially in Asia which contributed 81% to the total revenues in the second quarter.For the third quarter, the company expects revenues to lie between $31 million and $32 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 30%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $31.5 million. Further, the consensus estimate for earnings is projected at 14 cents per share.Coming to the price performance, shares of Camtek have returned 28.5% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the  's rally of 20.4%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.The company's robust product portfolio is expected to continue aiding its performance across all the end markets.The company's strengthening metrology business is likely to sustain momentum with the support of its new platform called EagleT-AP. Its growing orders from OSAT and memory manufacturers remain positive.Further, Camtek's increasing exposure in the front-end equipment market remains a catalyst. Its expanding macro defect inspection business and strengthening relationship with VCSEL manufacturers on the back of its robust inspection systems are likely to aid revenue generation in this market.Furthermore, the company's strong focus toward expanding its footprint in the 2D inspection space will continue to drive its top-line growth. The company's side wall crack inspection technology for post dicing application continues to perform well. Further, Camtek is witnessing robust customer addition in this particular space.During the third quarter, the company acquired an order from a tier-one OSAT for its 2D high-throughput 2D inspection system. This along with the expansion of Camtek's 2D business in the three existing tier one accounts has bolstered its share in the 2D inspection market.Additionally, the company remains optimistic about its concerted focus on the semiconductor industry, especially in the advance packaging segment where advancement in the production technology requires metrology solutions and advanced inspection systems.All these factors are anticipated to drive the company's to-be reported quarter results.However, ongoing trade tension between the United States and China remains a concern as it is making the semiconductor market sluggish. This does not bode well for the company's growing focus on semiconductor industry. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2019 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $77.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $77.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $72.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $79.77/share today.Because the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.84% return on the cash commitment, or 10.40% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $77.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $82.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $79.77/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $82.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.44% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $82.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $82.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Analog Devices Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of ADI entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $87.11 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, the RSI reading has hit 29.1 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 42.6. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, ADI's recent annualized dividend of 1.92/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.13% based upon the recent $89.99 share price.A bullish investor could look at ADI's 29.1 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

"n Oct 4, chip stocks took a beating after Deutsche Bank  reduced its 2019 earnings estimates for a number of chipmakers, citing growing weakness in business activity. This raised panic among investors, leading to huge selloffs on Thursday.That said, chip stocks have been largely responsible for the long-running market rally. However, fears of a bubble are making a comeback courtesy of a bunch of market watchers, who feel that the trade war has started taking a toll on chip stocks.However, the sector's fundamentals are still strong, with global semiconductor sales increasing once again in August, per the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). Given this scenario, it makes semiconductor stocks must haves for your portfolio.On Oct 4, investors' confidence was dented after Deutsche Bank reduced its 2019 earnings estimates by 5% on average for as many as eight chipmakers. The firm cited weakness in business activity as a major reason that could affect the semiconductor industry.This resulted in investors panicking, leading to huge selloffs. This saw shares of Texas Instruments Incorporated  , Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.  and Analog Devices, Inc.  plummeting 2.1%, 2.3% and 2%, respectively.The PHLX Semiconductor index (SOX) declined more than 1.8%. Understandably, trade war fears have been making investors jittery. China is one of the biggest markets for semiconductors and investors are panicking that a full-fledged trade war could hit the chip stocks.Semiconductor stocks may have been taking a hit of late but chip stocks have been responsible for the market's rally for quite some time now. Trade war fears have been gripping markets, making investors jittery. Despite this, the Semiconductor Industry Association on Oct 1 said that global semiconductor sales reached $40.16 billion in August, up 14.9% year over year. Moreover, global semiconductor sales were 1.7% higher than July's total of $39.49 billion.This is also the first time that monthly global chip sales have topped the $40 billion mark. According to John Neuffer, president and CEO, Semiconductor Industry Association, ""Sales remain strong across every major semiconductor product category and regional market, with the China and Americas markets standing out with the largest year-year growth.""Also, regional sales compared to August 2017 increased in China to 27.3%. Moreover, per research firm, Inkwood Research, the global semiconductor market is projected to witness a CAGR of 7.67% between 2017 and 2024.China is one of the biggest markets for semiconductors and trade war fears have been denting investors' confidence. However, the impressive sales figures are a proof that the fears might just be overblown. Also, China's limitations in building its own tech industry might restrict it from acting against U.S.-based chipmakers.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, while China is its biggest market. Trade war fears definitely have dented investors' confidence but chip stocks aren't as susceptible to trade war as industrials. Also, China's limitations in building its own tech industry might restrict it from acting against U.S.-based tech players.Given the robust demand for semiconductors and an increase in global semiconductor sales once again in August, the recent fears may be overblown. This is why picking semiconductor stocks still looks like a smart option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics. is one of the world's largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors (diodes, MOSFETs, and infrared optoelectronics) and passive electronic components (resistors, inductors and capacitors).Vishay Intertechnology sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for Analog Devices (ADI). Shares have lost about 2.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Analog Devices due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Analog Devices Inc. reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46. Moreover, the bottom line increased 22% year over year and 6% sequentially. Also, the figure surpassed the guided range of $1.38-$1.52.Revenues of $1.57 billion topped the consensus mark of $1.52 billion and came ahead of the guided range of $1.47-$1.55billion. Moreover, the top line improved 7.8% year over year and 3.9% sequentially.The strong growth was driven by robust performance from industrial, automotive and communications end-markets.The company has authorized to repurchase an additional $2 billion of its common stock.Industrial revenues (50% of the total sales) soared 14% year over year and 1% sequentially to $793.3 million.Communications revenues (21% of the total sales) grew 27% year over year and 12% sequentially to $323.9 million.Automotive revenues (16% of the total sales) jumped 6% from the year-ago quarter and 3% from the last reported quarter to $246.9 million.Consumer revenues (13% of the total sales) declined 17% year over year but increased 5% sequentially to $208.6 million.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis but decreased 10 bps sequentially to 71.2%.Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 150 bps from the year-ago quarter and 70 bps sequentially to 28.5%.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 220 bps on a year-over-year basis and 60 bps sequentially to 42.7%.Analog Devices exited the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $772.6 million, down from $806.5 million at the end of fiscal second quarter.Long-term debt was approximately $6.5 billion, down from $6.93 billion at fiscal second quarter-end.Net cash provided by operations was $620.7 million, down from $718.5 million reported in the fiscal second quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Analog Devices expects revenues of $1.57 billion (+/- $40 million). The company projects interest and other expenses at approximately $57 million. Earnings are expected to be$1.52 (+/- $0.06) per share.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.Currently, Analog Devices has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

"e generally use our electronic gadgets without thinking, expecting them to understand our operating environment, read our commands correctly and store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them.But what goes on behind the process is complicated, and enabled by semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). So most electronic gadgets use a combination of these semiconductor devices.The industry is cyclical, making for periods of expanding capacity and supply that outpace demand followed by periods during which the growing demand matches then exceeds supply. So there is a certain elasticity in prices. Moreover, these semiconductor components have wide application across automotive, communications, computing/cloud/data center, industrial, medical and other markets, so players can serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality.According to IC Insights' 2018 McClean Report, analog products (both general purpose and application-specific) will increase by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% to $74.8 billion in 2022 from $54.5 billion in 2017. Signal conversion components (data converters, mixed-signal devices, etc.) are forecast to record double-digit sales gains in three of the next five years.Here are the three major themes in the industry: while most experts agree that the semiconductor growth rate won't be as exciting this year as it was in 2017, the analog and mixed-signal parts will be decent, supporting the thesis that the current semiconductor cycle continues to stretch out. The primary drivers of this cycle extension are the data center that is growing exponentially because of the continuing shift in workloads to the cloud and the advent of artificial intelligence, and IoT, both of which are expanding the scope of computing. , while companies' current R&D budgets are still largely focused on the computing segment, demand for traditional computing equipment like PCs and even newer-age tablets are sluggish and high penetration rates mean that replacement sales are the main driver (except some strength in developing markets). So M&A with the goal of expanding capabilities and acquiring key talent remains a top priority for companies. Additionally, budgets continue to be reallocated to areas like automotive, where increased electronics per car and automation are driving current sales, with future growth prospects remaining very bright because of the drive to implement clean energy and reduce auto emissions, and the adoption of semi to fully autonomous (level 3-5) driving capabilities. , the adoption of 5G communications technology, enabling 10X the data rate as 4G, will be a huge boost to analog-mixed signal sales both in base stations and end devices. Because of the multiple input (MI) and multiple output (MO) streams the technology will enable in base stations, demand for sensors and power management analog including envelope tracking chips (to manage excess power flow and thus reduce heating), as well as gallium nitride (GaN) materials will increase. Moreover, since 5G is only involved in short range signals, it will not totally replace 4G but will supplement it. So it will be additive in terms of component demand.The greatest challenge in all this is cost because the cost and complications of fabricating chips continue to increase while their broader adoption across devices of varying value requires prices to decrease.The longer-term challenge is with respect to China, which is bringing new fabs online. The increased supply will bring down prices and dampen sales for American players, likely in 2020 and beyond. The outcome of the current trade war remains unclear.The Zacks  industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #203, which places it at the bottom 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. In the past year, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year is a mere 1.1% while for 2019, it is down 0.1%Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.The Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed Industry has lagged the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.The industry has declined 26.6% over this period compared to the S&P 500 index's increase of 3.2% and broader sector's decline of 0.7%.On the basis of forward12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing semiconductor companies, the industry is currently trading at 12.3X compared to the S&P 500's 15.7X and the Zacks Tech sector's 17.5X.In fact, the industry is currently trading at the low end of its annual range of 18.86X to 12.33X and therefore, also below the median of 17.70X, as the chart below shows.The analog semiconductor market should continue to see secular growth because the underlying drivers are strong and a significant amount of product differentiation is required in the design process, which insulates players to a certain extent. The current sluggishness is tied to weakness in its largest volume business (PCs) and the inability to quickly transfer resources elsewhere to adapt to changing market scenarios. So growth may actually slow down or turn negative until the necessary adjustments are substantially completed.So it's perhaps not surprising that just one of the stocks in the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed market currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We are also presenting two stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that investors may want to hold on to.You can see  . : Shares of this supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors for high-end consumer, enterprise computing, communications and industrial equipment have appreciated 11.6% over the past year. Its current Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. : This leading provider of a broad portfolio of high performance analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing chips used in virtually all types of electronic devices has seen a 12.7% erosion in its share price over the past year. Its current Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. : This provider of high performance mixed-signal semiconductors saw its share price drop 36.7% in the past year.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $70.38 per unit.With QQEW trading at a recent price near $63.71 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.46% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Shire plc (Symbol: SHPG), T-Mobile US Inc (Symbol: TMUS), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although SHPG has traded at a recent price of $175.85/share, the average analyst target is 18.16% higher at $207.78/share. Similarly, TMUS has 14.35% upside from the recent share price of $66.01 if the average analyst target price of $75.48/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $109.60/share, which is 11.19% above the recent price of $98.57. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SHPG, TMUS, and ADI:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@QQEW's Underlying Holdings Could Mean 10% Gain Potential@2018-08-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qqews-underlying-holdings-could-mean-10-gain-potential-2018-08-31
"Chicago, IL - August 24, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Medtronic  , EOG Resources  , CSX Corp.  , Analog Devices  and Autodesk  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Medtronic, EOG Resources and CSX Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Products industry in the last three months, gaining +9.9% vs. +4.3%. Medtronic posted better-than-expected numbers in its first-quarter fiscal 2019.All major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful achievement of synergy targets. The Zacks analyst likes the company's solid growth trend in the United States after adjusting for the divestitures as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies.Also, gradually stabilizing CRHF market holds promise. The company is also focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses. Medtronic is highly positive about its foray into the $1 billion standalone CGM market with its Guardian Connect.Yet escalating costs and expenses continue to weigh on Medtronic's bottom line. The company's 2019 guidance remains conservative on apprehension of significant currency headwind.(You can  ).Shares of  have gained around +38.7% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas E&P Industry, which has gained +23% over the same period. The company holds premium acreages in the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays where it has identified 17,000 premium wells that could lend access to almost 11.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves. In the Eagle Ford alone, EOG identified 7,200 locations that will drive the firm's oil production.During 2016 and 2017, almost 50% and 85% of the wells drilled by EOG Resources met the standard of premium wells. Notably, the firm expects almost 90% of the wells to meet the standard in 2018. EOG Resources recently reported strong second-quarter 2018 results, supported by higher oil price realization.However, the Zacks analyst thinks escalating lease and well operating expenses are hurting the company. Also, limited exposure to international resources is a drag.(You can  ).Strong Buy-ranked  's shares have gained +52.4% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Rail industry, which has gained +34.6% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks CSX is being aided by lower costs under the Precision Scheduled Railroading system.Notably, this system was implemented by the company's former CEO - E. Hunter Harrison - who died December 2017. Designed to improve operational efficiency, the system is being backed by CSX's current CEO Jim Foote. Also, improvement in operating ratio is in tune with the company's cost control efforts.The metric has been steadily declining (lower the value the better) over the past few quarters. Volume growth, efforts to reward shareholders and lower tax rates are added tailwinds. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 9.8% over the last 60 days, reflecting the positivity surrounding the stock. CSX's high debt levels, however, raise concern.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Analog Devices and Autodesk.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

"Companies like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) tend to get the bulk of media coverage when they have news or report earnings, but  (NASDAQ:  ) is quietly holding its own and ADI stock is outperforming the others by some significant measures.For example, Analog Devices doesn't have near the market cap of Intel ($36 billion vs. $216 billion), but its earnings growth and sales growth have been much better over the last three years. It can't match Applied Materials' earnings growth over the last three years, but its profit margin and operating margin are better. Overall, Analog Devices stock seems to be flying below the radar when compared to other chip companies.Analog Devices has seen its earnings grow by 29% per year over the last three years and its earnings-per-share grew by 21% in the most recent quarter. The company just announced earnings on Wednesday and it beat analysts' estimates on both EPS and revenue. The company also announced late Tuesday that it is reinstating its stock buyback program.As far as sales growth goes, ADI stock has averaged growth of 26%-per-year over the last three years, which is better than any of the other companies mentioned above. Sales were up 10% in the most recent quarterly report.Looking at the company's profitability measurements, the operating margin is 31.27%, the profit margin is 35.7% and the return on equity is at 21.6%. The operating and profit margins are also the highest of the four companies mentioned.Looking at a weekly chart, we see that Analog Devices stock has been moving higher over the last two and a half years with a trend channel forming that seems to be guiding the stock higher.The lower rail of the channel is right on top of the stock's 52-week moving average and that should give ADI stock two layers of support on any pullback.Something else to take note of on the chart is that Analog Devices stock has been pretty consistent this year. Many of the other chip companies have seen 12-15% declines since mid-June.It also worth mentioning that the weekly stochastic readings are the lowest they have been since the February low. The stochastics never made it to oversold territory in February. In fact, they were in the same area they are in now when ADI stock reversed and moved higher.From the low in February to the high in June, ADI gained almost 30%.Investor sentiment toward Analog Devices is rather interesting compared to its competition. Most of the other chip companies have at least 30 analysts following them, while Analog Devices only has 26 following it.Of the 26 following ADI stock, 16 rate it as a ""buy"" and the other 10 rate it as a ""hold"", which means 61% of analysts have it rated as a buy. Although that may seem decent, 95% of the analysts following Applied Materials rate it as a ""buy"". Of the 31 analysts following  (NASDAQ:  ) - another popular semiconductor company - 90% of them rate it as a ""buy"". So not only does ADI not get as much coverage, but the optimism from analysts isn't nearly as high.The short interest ratio on Analog Devices stock also stands out from the crowd. The short interest ratio is simply the number of shares sold short divided by the average daily trading volume. Analog Devices' short interest ratio is currently at 3.31. That is the second-highest short interest ratio of the seven chip companies I compared Analog Devices stock too.I normally view a short interest ratio of 5.0 or higher as extreme pessimism. Analog's isn't terribly high, but compared to its competition there is more pessimism toward ADI stock. It's the stock that has outperformed the most in the industry, both fundamentally and in terms of its price performance in recent months, but there is more pessimism toward it.That isn't a bad thing.The bottom line is that Analog Devices is performing very well in terms of the company's fundamental performance and the stock's price performance. Despite these facts, Analog Devices stock seems to be less respected than its competitors and that could be a good thing for you.The higher pessimism can serve to boost the ADI stock price as bears become bulls. Having fewer analysts following the company and less of them rating the stock as a buy leaves room for additional coverage and more room for upgrades than we see with other stocks.I look for Analog Devices to continue outperforming its peers and suggest you add the stock to your holdings. I would look to hold it as long as the stock remains above the lower rail of the channel and above the 52-week moving average.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analog Devices Is the Perfect Stock to Buy While No One Is Looking@2018-08-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-perfect-stock-buy-while-no-one-looking-2018-08-27
"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options become available this week, for the October 19th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new October 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $92.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $95.57/share today.Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.63% return on the cash commitment, or 22.87% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $95.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $97.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.05. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $95.57/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $97.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.16% if the stock gets called away at the October 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $97.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $97.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.15% boost of extra return to the investor, or 18.64% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 23%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 22%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $95.57) to be 22%.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@SOXX, ADI, AMAT, LRCX: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2018-09-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/soxx-adi-amat-lrcx-large-inflows-detected-etf-2018-09-28
Stocks were up again on Wednesday, but just barely … another day the bulls were hesitant to add to the recent rally. Politics played its role in the pause, but odds are good that the sheer weight of all the recent bullishness is what's really holding the market back. The headlines are just an excuse.Whatever the case, not every name was held back.  (NASDAQ:  ) jumped nearly 8% in response to news it had inked a deal with  (NYSE:  ) to  .  (NYSE:  ) shares were up 3% on the heels of a much-needed  .Neither of those names sport stock charts that have earned them a spot on Thursday's list of potential trades worth watching though. And, despite the slew of still-bullish headlines, plenty of names are still knocking on the door of downside moves against a backdrop of a marketwide rally that's still running out of gas.For today,  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) are shaping up as your top trading prospects… at least until something dramatic changes their brewing situations. Here's a look at those particular stock charts.If GGP rings a bell, there's a reason. It was one of the three stock charts put under the microscope  as it began to rally out of a funk and pick up steam.The stock has continued to wiggle its way higher, though not dramatically. But, it's knocking on the door of a major technical ceiling that, if cleared, could still easily light a fire under this chart.Click to Enlarge • The ceiling in question is the 200-day moving average line (white), currently at $21.59. GGP actually moved above that mark a couple of times in the meantime, but couldn't get going in earnest. The recent support from the 20-day moving average line (blue) found last week and this week may be just the springboard needed.• While the uptrend has been wobbly at times, the overall volume is still net bullish. The accumulation-distribution line on the daily chart is now at multiweek highs. Ditto for the weekly chart.• Should this potential breakout take hold, the previous ceiling at $23.85 is still the first checkpoint target.When Wednesday's regular-hours trading began, Analog Devices shareholders had good reason to worry. Though its fiscal third quarter report was a good one, ADI shares opened in the red … by more than a little bit. It took a while, but by the end of yesterday's action the stock had fought its way back to a respectable 2.1% gain.This is a case where the intraday action is more telling than the close-to-close price change. The bears had ample opportunity to drag Analog Devices below the pivotal 200-day moving average line. The fact that the bulls brought the stock back from the brink speaks volumes.Click to Enlarge • The daily chart makes the point clearly. All it took was a kiss of the 200-day line (white) to inspire an even stronger buyback that carried shares back above all of its key moving average lines. The volume surge on the way up says this was the majority opinion.• Zooming out to a weekly chart it's relatively easy to see just how important, and powerful, the 200-day moving average line has been in keeping the long-term rally going. This renewed bullishness is actually just part of a long-standing pattern.Last but not least, with nothing more than a quick glance it would appear Citizens Financial Group is still just a choppy, back-and-forth name.Upon taking a closer look, though, it's clear there's more going on here than would seem with a mere cursory look. We're seeing higher highs and higher lows for the first time in months, and there's still plenty of room to keep running.Click to Enlarge  • The daily chart of CFG has already hurdled a couple of different falling resistance lines that had been guiding the stock lower as far back as February.• Zooming out to a weekly chart we can see this turnaround has taken shape gradually … with some help (again) from the lower Bollinger band (yellow). That's important. Slow, methodical U-shaped turnarounds tend to follow-through better than sharp V-shaped ones.• Also on the weekly chart of Citizens Financial Group we can see a fresh bullish MACD divergence and a Chaikin line that's just crossed above zero. Both are signs that the new bullish undertow is well-developed. It's also evident in this timeframe that this is a pattern we've seen before from CFG.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Big Stock Charts for Thursday: GGP, Analog Devices and Citizens Financial Group@2018-08-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-big-stock-charts-for-thursday%3A-ggp-analog-devices-and-citizens-financial-group-2018-08

Operating margins expanded meaningfully compared to last year and non-GAAP EPS increased over 20% year-over-year and came in above the high end of our guidance.We also delivered very strong free cash flow, generating $2.2 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, translating to approximately 36% free cash flow margin. ADI's cash-generating capabilities enables us to achieve our 2x leverage ratio goal three quarters ahead of plan and we are pleased to announce that we've reinstated our share repurchase program. And given the long-term prospects of this business, our Board has authorized an additional $2 billion in share repurchases.Now, before Prashanth goes deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to continue the discussion around key market trends that are shaping our industry and the steps that ADI is taking to seize these opportunities. On the last , I spoke about the transition to 5G for wireless communications and what it means for ADI. Today I'd like to focus on Industry 4.0, which is driving the next evolution of innovation and investment in industrial automation.For many industries, the digital factory will bring greater supply chain efficiencies, higher quality, more flexibility, and a safer workplace, all contributing to higher productivity. This smart factory in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical process of the factory or plant will use additional data for decentralized decision-making, human assistance, increased safety, and more predictability. This will require a mass deployment of intelligent sensors at the edge. For many decades, ADI has been viewed as the go-to edge solution provider. The place where the data is born, so to speak, and I'll highlight later how we are enabling this evolution.Although ADI is excited about this emerging opportunity, we expect this transition to take time, while the deployment of today's existing sensing, signal processing, and power architectures will continue to drive growth for many years. In fact, our core automation business represents a significant portion of our total industrial business today and we're taking a long view to ensure we keep at the cutting edge of technology and customer support. Our domain expertise is unmatched and gives us invaluable insights to understand our customers' challenges and where the markets are going.And we've been investing ahead, broadening our portfolio through targeted R&D, collaborating with leading automation customers, and leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our offerings to include algorithms and software. At the same time, we've extended our reach with the addition of the LTC sales force and FAEs and the complementarity of our customer bases enables us to access more opportunities at current customers and increase penetration at new customers.We believe that these targeted investments position us to continue to grow our market share and to outperform in the years to come. For decades, our products and solutions have been adopted by many thousands of customers around the world. Their equipment is used at the factory floor level across a very diverse set of end markets, such as automotive, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, smartphones, food and beverage, and many, many others. And this is a long lifecycle business. Once qualified and deployed to strict industrial requirements, customers keep using ADI's proven products. This makes this business very sticky with high barriers to entry.With a broader set of technologies and capabilities, our customers continue to turn to ADI for the best performance and precision, robustness and safety. The addition of LTC adds high-performance power to our already expansive portfolio, enabling further innovation. And, in fact, power plays an increasingly critical role in solving more and more of the design challenges of our customers, as they further automate in space- and energy-constrained areas. For example, we just recently launched a product that enables up to eight analog outputs on a card, previously unachievable due to excess heat. We succeeded by combining the signal chain expertise of ADI with LTC's power know-how to maintain an unchanged power density.Safety is also critical. These systems require essential electrical isolation barriers to protect low-voltage electronics, as well as humans, from high voltages. Traditionally, customers have used optical technology to transfer data across these safety barriers. However, frustrated by their lack of reliability and power, we increasingly see customers turning to ADI for our digital isolation technology. So with unique architectures and leading process technology, our iCoupler isolation solutions are significantly more reliable and can transfer data and power twice as fast as our nearest competitor. We also remove customers' industry certification pain with ready-to-use solutions, accelerating their time to market.As a result of all that, we have shipped over 2 billion channels and are increasing our market share and driving revenue growth well into the double digits annually. Today, as manufacturers respond to a more demanding consumer base, they are turning to more distributed and flexible architectures. With this in mind, I will focus now on two examples to highlight how innovation at the factory floor is driving new growth opportunities for ADI.The first is robotics. Across all geographies, significant investments are being made to upgrade from a labor-intensive footprint to a more sophisticated automated infrastructure. Repetitive tasks are now being performed by collaborative robots, commonly known as co-bots. These are smaller robots that work in collaboration with humans. While the traditional large-scale industrial robotics industry remains healthy and growing, the newer collaborative robotics market is in the early stages of growth. Collectively, this market is expected to grow at more than 10% annually, adding more than 500,000 systems per year by 2022.ADI is unique in our ability to combine all these key technologies for the traditional large-scale robots, as well as the fast-growing co-bot segments. Along with our traditional precision control technology solutions, including signal chains and digital isolation, we effectively more than triple our content opportunity with the addition of power management, communications, and sensors.The second area of innovation is the flexible factory floor. Here, robots operate in tandem with many other systems, including PLC controllers and a vast array of sensors and actuators. These machines or devices are designated as either inputs or outputs. Several years ago, ADI took on the challenge of implementing an integrated software-configurable architecture based on our high-performance precision signal processing portfolio. With this breakthrough in innovation, ADI created a disruptive capability, allowing universal selection and configuration of many types of input and output devices. This has opened new opportunities and allows customers to easily install and reconfigure their automation equipment.In addition to flexibility, the big value impact comes in the total cost of ownership at the factory level. Significant savings for customers include eight weeks, on average, faster installation time, savings on engineering, and a significant reduction in factory space. Factory production flows can be adapted more easily and these changes that could traditionally take hours can now be done in minutes. With this new capability, we've increased our sun by an additional $200 million. And since our initial design wins at leading customers over the past year, we've substantially increased our opportunity pipeline.As we look toward the future with the digital factory, flexible architectures with an increase of robotics will enable the transformation of manufacturing. With that comes a demand for higher bandwidth, predictability of machine help, robustness in security. Working closely with our customers, we've invested to extend our portfolio and ability to solve these challenges. In addition to offering the most robust industrial wireless networking technology, ADI is enabling the transition to newer secure connectivity architectures. We're leading the path to higher bandwidth, industrial-ready Ethernet, using the latest time-sensitive networking standards. ADI's industrial Deterministic Ethernet is a far cry from standard Ethernet and provides the determinism, reliability, robustness, and the security required in the hostile environment of the digital factory.Finally, our sensing and measurement technology provides contextual data, enabling predictive outcomes. ADI's depth, optical, and touch sensors are used to create safe working zones for humans, while vibration, electrical, and temperature sensors are used for condition-based monitoring, predicting the mechanical wear of the machines to maximize factory up-time.So, to summarize, at the edge of the factory floor, where the data is born, ADI is the leader in industrial automation. This market has grown steadily for many years and we're witnessing a new era of opportunity, innovation, and growth. While our core technologies continue to provide the foundational performance for control and precision, our new investments double our sun and allow us to solve the emerging challenges our customers face. All in all, I'm very optimistic about what the future will bring for ADI in this new world.So, with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financials. -- Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Q3 2018 . With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.As Vince mentioned, we delivered another record-setting quarter. We had 8% revenue growth, 20% higher earnings per share, and free cash flow margins at 36%. But before I get into the details of the income statement, let me cover the end markets.Our B2B revenue increased 13% year-over-year, led by double digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 50% of sales in the quarter and increased in the low double digits year-over-year. Growth in this market continues to be broad-based, with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year ago quarter. As Vince highlighted, the factory automation market is undergoing changes not seen in decades and customers are looking to ADI as the trusted partner to provide next-generation solutions to transform their industry and increase productivity.In the communications market, which represented 21% of sales in the third quarter, sales into both wireless and wired applications increased at a double digit rate compared to the same period last year. Growth in our wireless business accelerated as the market continues to densify their 4G networks, accelerate small cell deployments, and begin the transition to 5G massive MIMO. This better market environment, combined with our strong position across carriers, with our high-performance mixed signal and RF portfolio, positions our communications business for continued growth and outperformance.Our automotive business represented 16% of sales in the quarter. And in line with our commentary last quarter, sales increased at a mid-single digit rate compared to a year ago, with all applications increasing over that time period. ADI organic revenue performed well once again, increasing high single digits year-over-year. And, finally, our consumer business represented 13% of sales in the third quarter and, as expected, decreased year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand for products used in the portable consumer applications.Now moving on to the P&L. Revenue for the quarter was $1.57 billion, above the high end of our guidance, increasing 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Gross margins of 71.2% increased 70 bps year-over-year and, given the mix of business, were down slightly sequentially.OpEx in the third quarter was $448 million, or 28.5% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution resulted in operating margins at the high end of guidance at 42.7%.Non-op expenses in the third quarter were approximately $58 million and our tax rate was approximately 6%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter came in above the high end of guidance at $1.53, increasing more than 20% year-over-year.Moving on to the balance sheet, inventory increased 2% sequentially and days were 112 in the quarter, down four days from the second quarter. Distribution inventory was just above seven-and-a-half weeks, flat sequentially and up modestly compared to the year ago quarter.We generated free cash flow of approximately $570 million in the quarter, bringing our trailing 12-month free cash flow to a record $2.2 billion, with associated free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. And during the quarter, we also paid down $430 million of debt, bringing our net leverage to 2x. Capital additions in the third quarter were $52 million and we expect CapEx to continue to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales.During the quarter, we paid $179 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock.All in all, it was a terrific quarter and the Q4 guide is equally strong, which, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high level, we're expecting the fourth quarter to look a lot like the third quarter. We're planning for the revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.61 billion.At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto, and communications in the aggregate to increase in the low double digits year-over-year. This would represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit year-over-year revenue growth for our B2B markets.We're planning for gross margins to be approximately 71%. We expect our operating expenses to be in the range of $440 million to $450 million. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales will be approximately flat sequentially, which brings operating margins in the fourth quarter expected in the range of 42% to 43%. We expect non-op expenses to be approximately $57 million and our tax rate around 7%. And based on these inputs, diluted EPS, excluding special items, would be in the range of $1.46 to $1.58.Now, before we move to the Q&A session, I wanted to provide some context for last night's press release. As I mentioned earlier, we achieved a 2x leverage ratio during our fiscal third quarter, just 16 months post-closing of the Linear acquisition. Over those 16 months, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt, or nearly one-third of the debt we raised for the deal. During this same period, we also returned approximately $850 million to our shareholders through dividends. With this milestone achieved, we can now provide more clarity on our capital allocation plans.Our first call on capital will always be to invest in the business, whether through targeted R&D, smart capital spending, or strategic M&A. These investments ensure we continue to have the right technology portfolio to increase our competitive advantage and drive profitable and sustainable growth.Given the profitability of this franchise, the long-term prospects for our business, and the benefits from U.S. tax reform, we now plan to return 100% of our free cash flow after debt repayments to investors. Under this framework, the dividend policy remains the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy. We have increased the dividend 15 times over the last 14 years and remain committed to our goal of a 5% to 10% increase annually.As you saw in yesterday's press release, we are reinstating our share repurchase program and announced a $2 billion authorization from our Board of Directors. We plan to use this approval to offset dilution and, over time, lower our share count. We believe this capital strategy will continue to deliver value for our shareholders and allow us to continue the investments necessary to meet the evolving needs of our customers in a dynamic growth environment.So, to wrap it up, this was another record quarter for ADI across many metrics. The strength in our business resulted in strong revenue growth and profit conversion. We see this momentum continuing for Q4 and the early achievement of our 2x leverage goal enables us to reinstate our share repurchase program.And, with that, let me turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session. -- Thanks, Prashanth. Okay. Let's get to the Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After your initial response, we'll give you an opportunity for a follow-up question. Operator, can we have our first question please?For those participating by telephone dial-in, if you have a question, please press ""*1"" on your phone. If your question has been answered and you wish to be removed from the queue, please press ""#"". If you are listening on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking the question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.Our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. -- Good morning, Craig. -- Good morning. Thanks so much. Can you hear me now? -- We hear you fine, Craig. Yeah. -- Perfect. Good morning. Just a question on B2B. Understanding it's double digits in aggregate, there have been some moving pieces between segments, particularly autos and communications. So any color as you look into the October quarter? Just a little bit more granular between the communications business, industrial, and autos for the October quarter? -- Yeah. Well, look, Craig, B2B remains very strong. We've had a couple of stellar years of growth and we remain in a strong zone here. The growth has been led primarily by industrial and communications. And that's, as you know, 70% of our business today. So I'd say, at this point, inventory is in very good shape. Well-managed on our balance sheet. It's in good shape in the channel. And I'd say lead times are stable as well. And our overall guidance implies, as Prashanth said, our seventh consecutive double digit year-over-year growth in B2B.So I think we said clearly that we see pockets of slowing growth in industrial. I think over the foreseeable future, industrial will perform in the two- to -three times GDP area, probably at the higher end of that.Clearly, communications, ADI's position in 4G systems is good and carriers are spending more money in 4G. And we're beginning to see as well the early stages of deployment in 5G. So given the portfolio we have, the penetration we have at the key customers in wireless communications infrastructure, I think we're poised to see some stellar growth in the wireless communications side of the business. Also, there's a significant upgrade cycle taking place in kind of the optical back hall. So I foresee that, again, given the strength of our penetration and the product portfolio that we have, we'll see some decent growth there too.We've talked about automotive many times. My sense is that that will continue to perform in kind of the mid-single digit growth level. So it's, I'd say, moderate but a very, very important part of what we're doing. -- Thank you, Craig. -- Great. -- We're actually moving to the next call given the time constraints we have.Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. -- Hi. Thank you very much for letting me ask a question. I just wanted to focus on the gross margin side. I get the mix change. Consumer was stronger, at least versus what we were modeling. So it came a little bit lighter versus what you had guided to, Prashanth. But, if you look at the guide, that seems a little bit lighter as well. So can you just help us understand the puts and takes on gross margin, please? -- Absolutely, Ambrish. Thanks for the question. So recall that our gross margin model is to be above 70%, which is industry-leading. And we're above that both for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But you're right, margins were slightly lower, the upside driven by communications and consumer, and the result was our industrial mix declined to 50% or about 200 bps from where we were at second quarter level. And then as we look to the fourth quarter, very similar to what Vince just told Craig, our strongest growth is going to come from communications and automotive. So that mix in the businesses is driving a little bit of that shift in gross margin but still well above our model.And I'll remind everyone that we do have about another $100 million of cost synergies, which should start layering in toward the beginning of 2021, late 2020. So we still expect to be able to continue to drive gross margins up as the operations team shuts down the facility in Singapore and in California. And then, overall, our focus is on expanding op margins. So as long as we keep driving our revenue faster than our operating expenses, we'll be able to continue to drive the profitability for this business. Thanks for the question, Ambrish. -- Just one quick follow-up to that. Prashanth was talking about the fastest growth sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, the strongest growth once again would be industrial and communications, which both grow in the double digits.Can we have our next caller please?Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Good morning, John. -- Good morning, guys. Good morning. Thanks for letting me ask some questions. Congratulations on the strong results, especially B2B. My question is just a little bit on the consumer side. If I back into -- kind of using your B2B guidance for Q4 to be up kind of low double digits, you kind of back into a consumer number, which puts consumer down about 20% for the full year, which is kind of at the high end of the range of the down 20% to 30% that you guys have been talking about at the Analyst Day. The low end of the range, sorry. I'm just kind of curious. Does that now reflect the new base off of which you guys can grow that consumer business? Or were there some things that happened this year that means that, as we move into FY '19, you might still have some headwinds to work through in that consumer business with that one large customer? -- Yeah. So I think what you've implied is just about right, John. At this point, it's very, very hard to say what will happen next year. So we've got a good read on what the number will be this year, in terms of the decline in the portable business. It's very hard to tell what '19 will look like quite yet. But it's a fast cycle business and we win designs and you can lose designs as well in a very, very short period of time. But I would say, to directly answer your question, as it stands today, the consumer business hasn't yet troughed in '18 so we'll see some further decline in the portable part, I believe, in 2019. -- Thanks, John. Can we move to our next question please?Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Thanks for taking my question. Your industrial and communications segments are doing quite well but auto, at this kind of low to mid-single digit growth, remains below the peer group. Can you give us a sense of what has been done so far to perhaps fix some of the issues? What needs to be done so that you can get back to the high single digit to double digit growth rate that a number of your competitors are growing at? Thank you. -- Yeah. Thanks for the question. So the numbers that we've talked about are the combined legacy ADI and LTC. The legacy ADI part of the business is growing in the high single digit area and the LT part in the low single digit arena. So there are two primary components, I would say, that we're working hard to correct, particularly on the legacy LT side of things.No. 1 is making sure that our BMS business, the battery management business, gets back onto a solid growth track. And I'm very encouraged by the progress that we've made there, particularly in the last two quarters, holding onto the sockets that we had and finding new sockets across the globe, particularly in North America and Europe in the electric powertrain. And we've also got a crop of new products coming, I think, that are very, very exciting. And also on the power side of things, we're more aggressive. We're leveraging the ADI cost base, where we've got fundamentally better cost structures, to make sure that we take our own fair share of high performance power sockets across the globe.So I think it's fair to say that we'll be in this mid-single digit growth area, depending on the market, of course, for the next year-and-a-half, two years. But somewhere in the 2020 area, I expect us to see a meaningful bend upwards in the growth curve. -- Thank you, Vivek. Can we have our next question?Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. -- Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get back to the segment growth. Were you trying to imply that everything is actually growing? I know you gave some differences in sequential growth versus year-over-year growth across the segments but are you still implying that everything is -- I guess, I would comment everything -- are you still trying to say everything is flat to up sequentially? Or do you still have some B2B segments that could be down sequentially even driving double digit year-over-year growth? -- No, Stacy, you got it right. Everything, as we move from Q3 to Q4, is up sequentially. What you do see is stronger growth up sequentially -- and, as you know, we don't guide by segments anymore -- but what you do see is stronger growth coming sequentially from communications and automotive. And that is driving some mix impact overall, which gets back to, I think it was Ambrish's question. -- Got it. I guess my only issue, it seems to take me above your B2B growth. Although maybe you're suggesting, when you say low double-digits, you're more than 10%, I guess, is what you have to be implying with that guidance. -- Correct. -- I think, if it was 10%, we would have said 10%. -- Low double digits to me means probably anywhere between 10% and 12%. That's how I think about it, Stacy. -- That's very helpful. Thank you. -- Thanks, Stacy. Next question please.Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. -- Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the strong results. A question for Vince on the industrial market. You said it's slowing. Is that just a function of getting back to the mean from some very strong year-over-year growth rates? Is it seasonality or are you seeing anything else going on in that end market? Thank you. -- Yeah, good question, Tore. So I think from a global standpoint, what we see is that the macro economy is mainly constructive right now. You're seeing PMI and GDP remain solid across the globe, the PMIs and GDP. I've spoken with several customers and they remain optimistic as well about the future. So I'd say in industrial, business now is good. As I mentioned earlier, there have been some pockets of slower growth, I think driven by the uncertainties primarily in the geopolitical arena and as people think through what this tariff situation means for everybody. But I'd say demand is resilient. And as we have in our guidance for B2B, we've talked with double digit growth again here on an annual basis. So I would say, in general, the growth is getting back to a more normalized level. In our FY '17, our industrial business grew in the low 20%. This year, it will be in the kind of mid-teens. And so what I'm implying is that, given the tougher compares and given the environment right now, though demand is strong, I think we're getting to a more normalized two to three times GDP growth level. And probably at the higher end of that. -- Very helpful. Thank you. -- Thank you, Tore.Our next question is from Chris Danely with Citigroup. -- Good morning, Chris. -- Hey, guys. I guess just one sort of summary question on the end markets. So, Vince, you're kind of giving us the longer term growth of auto and industrial. How about communications? So communications looks like it's going to grow sort of in the mid-double digits this year. What do you think that should be longer term? And then maybe as just a brief follow-on, given that industrial is slowing, what should that mean for gross margins over the next several quarters? Should we think of them as sort of a flat-ish type of trajectory? -- Yeah, good questions, Chris. So at this point, I'd say given the product crop that we have and the penetration we've got and the secular trends in the wireless communications area, in particular, my sense is that, even though it's a very, very lumpy business when you look at it quarter by quarter, with 4G continuing to deploy with new architectures and 5G coming on board, my sense is that can be a double digit, kind of a 10% growth area for ADI for kind of the next 3-4 years. That's my sense. The back hall market, in particular, the optical side of that, I think is capable of growing as well in the kind of high single digit area. So a lot of that is driven by the market conditions are better, I think, in general. Carriers are more optimistic and are working hard to get new technologies into market as fast as they can.But, as I said, we've got a great new product crop and we have deeper and wider penetration, not to mention the fact that we're starting to see the early stages of the cross-selling of LT's power technologies with ADI's signal chain. So my sense is I feel good about that market. And, right now, even though prediction is a dangerous game, my sense is that we should be able to grow that business in kind of the low, I would say, double digit area for the foreseeable future. And I'll turn it over to Prashanth to answer the gross margin implication question. -- Thank you, Vince. So, Chris, the way that I would guide you to think about gross margins longer term is, I think, sort of flat-ish from where we are. As you know, we're still ahead of our long-term model of 70%. Our industrial business has very rich gross margins. Our communications business has great margins but not as strong as the industrial. And, as Vince mentioned, as we see more growth in that communications business, which is what we would expect for 2019, that is going to drive a little bit of mix on the margins. So probably more to be in line with flat-ish to where we're expecting Q4 to be.On top of that, I do want to remind folks, we are looking at about $100 million of cost synergies that should be modeled in for future, sort of in the late 2020, early 2021. Closing both the facilities, the one in Singapore and the one in the Bay Area in California. -- Great. Thanks for the color, guys. -- Thanks, Chris. Can we have our next question, Jennifer?Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. -- Thanks, guys. This is Jerry Zhang on for Blayne. I just had a question on the pace of buybacks. So when should we expect the share count to eventually start trending lower? And also, as a follow-up, how do you think about the plan for de-leveraging going forward? -- Thanks, Jerry. So I guess the way I would guide folks to think about our repurchase activity, I'll start with reminding everyone we generate a lot of cash, $2 billion plus on a trailing 12-month basis, and we have one of the highest free cash flow margins in the S&P 500. About $700 million plus of that is committed to the dividend. And, as I mentioned, we're still targeting to grow that 5% to 10% annually as we've done for the past 14 years. So the dividend would account for, let's call it, mid to high 30% of our free cash flow. That leaves a fairly substantial amount of our free cash flow available both for buybacks and debt repayments. Our focus will be to be in the market every quarter as an effort to, at a minimum, work to offset dilution. And then opportunistically we're gonna look to reduce share count over time.When you ask about leverage, I think it's a similar answer, in that, at a high level, we like to keep a good bit of cash available. So $750 million to $1 billion or so on hand. And then we do have a revolving credit facility in place for about another $1 billion. I don't think about leverage as a specific target for ADI, but more as how do we optimize the balance sheet and what do we need to do to maintain investment grade so we have the flexibility that we need. So given the cash-generating capabilities of the franchise, there's probably no need for us to be operating in a net cash position. So, going forward, I think you can expect us to always carry some level of debt and we'll be mindful of what is the rate environment as well as what are the other opportunities for us to invest in and use that to kind of balance where we maintain our leverage. Thank you for the question. -- Great. Thanks. -- Next question please.Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. -- Hi, guys. Good morning. I had a question on M&A. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your appetite for further acquisitions now that Linear is integrated as part of ADI. And to the extent you do have aspirations to buy more assets down the line, if you can talk a little bit about the technologies or the conditions that you would look for in a business. Thank you. -- Yeah, thank you. Well, our overall capital allocation framework, as Prashanth outlined, hasn't changed very much. The long-term value of our investments, both organic as well as inorganic, will continue to drive the long-term profitable growth trajectory for ADI. Our approach to acquisitions has been, and will continue to be, very disciplined. And at a very high level, our strategy is really focused on acquiring assets that improve our competitive moat, the breadth and depth of our competitive moat, from an innovation standpoint. So our goal really is to acquire technologies and engineering capabilities that will enhance us, make our portfolio more complete to meet the demands of the markets and customers of the future, and basically increase our overall ability to deliver increasing value to our customers. That's the path we're on and that's the path we'll continue to be on.And I'm not gonna talk about specific targets. We've got a successful track record and what we're looking at -- we're always looking but our standards are very, very high. So this was the case when we acquired Hittite and Linear, LTC, and also the myriad smaller things we've done over the last three or four years. So I'm very pleased with where we are now, in terms of our overall portfolio, but we're always on the look as the markets evolve and customers' needs evolve. So hopefully that gives you at least a philosophical view of how we think about M&A. -- Thanks for the question. Jennifer, can we move to our final question please?Yes. And our final question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. -- Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. Congratulations on the good results, especially with regard to the balance sheet and the buyback. My question is about revenue synergies. Can you update us as it relates to revenue synergies for the Hittite acquisition, which is clearly a few years in the rearview mirror? But I think you're starting to see revenue synergies kick in there. And what you anticipate with the same issue with Linear. Thank you. -- Yeah, good question. And as much as Hittite can give an indication of what's possible with regard to LT, we've more than doubled -- when we took Hittite on board, we more than doubled the growth rate. And we've been able to scale Hittite across a broader range of customers, bring a much more sophisticated manufacturing and quality assurance capability to the portfolio. So we've more than doubled the growth rate of Hittite. And of the $270 million-ish stating revenue point, you can back out what those numbers are. We're in the early stages. It's taken us basically, I'd say, three years to get to the point with Hittite where we're able to accelerate the conversion of the pipeline. It takes a while to build it, it takes a while to convert it, just given the latencies in the various markets that we attack.I've said before that, with LT, we are looking to make sure that, for every dollar of mix signal opportunity that ADI has -- it's $4.5 billion-ish today, at today's revenue levels -- that legacy LT's power should be a one-for-one match. So we're seeing a huge opportunity. We're excited by the areas that we're starting to win. We're in early production stage, for example, in communications and automotive sectors, which we felt would be the two most obvious places to get revenue synergy in the shorter term. So my sense is, again, getting to a doubling of the overall LT legacy growth rate in a period of 3-4 years is a reasonable expectation. -- Okay. Great. Thank you. -- Okay.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@SOXX, AVGO, AMD, ADI: Large Outflows Detected at ETF@2018-08-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/soxx-avgo-amd-adi-large-outflows-detected-etf-2018-08-16

f you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Analog Devices (ADI). This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this semiconductor maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.96%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Analog Devices came out with earnings of $1.45 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 per share, representing a surprise of 5.84%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.42 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.08%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Analog Devices. In fact, the Zacks (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Analog Devices. In fact, the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce  . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Analog Devices has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 22, 2018.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Morningstar Large-Cap ETF (Symbol: JKD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $178.63 per unit.With JKD trading at a recent price near $160.89 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.03% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of JKD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Aptiv PLC (Symbol: APTV), Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. (Symbol: MMC), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although APTV has traded at a recent price of $93.61/share, the average analyst target is 12.25% higher at $105.08/share. Similarly, MMC has 11.29% upside from the recent share price of $84.26 if the average analyst target price of $93.78/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $107.70/share, which is 11.06% above the recent price of $96.98. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of APTV, MMC, and ADI:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@JKD's Underlying Holdings Imply 11% Gain Potential@2018-07-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jkds-underlying-holdings-imply-11-gain-potential-2018-07-30

n Jul 30, we issued an updated research report on  .In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has yielded a return of 5.3% compared with the  's gain of 1.2%.InterDigital's commitment toward licensing its broad portfolio of technologies to wireless terminal equipment makers, which allows it to expand its core market capability, is noteworthy. Currently, it has leading companies such as Huawei, Samsung, LG and Apple under its licensing agreement. Also, InterDigital expects to grow its licensing revenue base by adding a number of other companies, which have attained market prominence over the past several years, to its licensees.Moreover, the company's global footprint, diversified product portfolio and the ability to penetrate in different markets are commendable. Apart from a strong portfolio of wireless technology solutions, the addition of technologies related to sensors, user interface and video to its offerings is likely to drive considerable value, considering the massive size of the market it licenses.Further, the company plans to acquire the patent licensing business of Technicolor - a pioneer in the video space. This buyout is expected to provide InterDigital with an enhanced portfolio of video technologies besides opening up new opportunities in the consumer electronics market.However, given the company's international presence, its business is exposed to macroeconomic risks. Moreover, its high investment in R&D projects might affect its profitability in the coming quarters.This apart, ongoing tensions between the United States and China due to trade restrictions imposed on the sale of communication equipment and technology solutions to Chinese firms are likely to hurt the industry's credibility and lead to losses. The failure of both the countries to resolve their trade differences might hinder the company's growth prospects.Some top-ranked stocks from the same space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp.  , Motorola Solutions, Inc.  and Analog Devices, Inc.  .

The segment witnessed 11.1% year over year growth in its gross bookings which came to $21 billion.Egencia revenues (5.4% of revenues) increased 15.6% on year-over-year basis and 3.3% sequentially to $156 million.

" (NASDAQ: WIX) has been on a roll recently. This is evident both by its  and its soaring stock price -- shares are up 74% year to date.While metrics like Wix's 42% year-over-year increase in revenue and 37% growth in free cash flow in its second-quarter earnings release do a great job of helping investors understand the company's momentum, there's plenty more to uncover in Wix's  .Here are three important topics management discussed during the call.Image source: Wix.com.During Q2, Wix added an impressive 205,000 net premium subscriptions, bringing total premium subscriptions to 3.7 million. While this represents strong year-over-year growth of 28%, it notably marked a deceleration from the 29% growth Wix saw in premium subscriptions in Q1.When asked about this trend, CFO Lior Shemesh suggested decelerating growth in the metric is unlikely to stick around:Shemesh added another reason not to be concerned: ""[O]verall the conversion is up even when we look at the new cohorts in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.""Speaking of conversion, or the rate registered users purchase a premium subscription, the company's Artificial Design Intelligence (ADI) continues to help drive improvements in the metric -- even as ADI expands to new languages.""Wix ADI continues to be a positive contributor to the overall conversion improvements,"" said CEO Avishai Abrahami. ""We are experiencing early success in additional languages other than English and plan to release more before the end of the year.""Management did a good job of articulating why ADI helps conversion in the company's first-quarter earnings release:Considering that Wix's second-quarter revenue came in above management's guidance and management boosted its outlook for full-year revenue, some investors may be looking for more insight into how management comes up with its guidance figures in the first place. After all, management's outlook for 40% to 41% year-over-year revenue growth in 2018 paints a rosy picture.But Abrahami implied Wix's guidance is conservative:With this approach to guidance in mind, investors shouldn't be surprised if Wix exceeds its updated full-year outlook for revenue between $597 to $599 million.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

"Chicago, IL - July 20, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include  ,  ,  ,  and  .As bouts of volatility and uncertainty are playing foul in the stock market, investors are looking for both growth and income in their portfolios. This can be easily achieved by honing in on companies that not only pay dividends, but also consistently increase their payout. As such, investors can enjoy rising current income while anticipating capital appreciation, irrespective of market conditions.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future and leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

s bouts of volatility and uncertainty are playing foul in the stock market, investors are looking for both growth and income in their portfolios. This can be easily achieved by honing in on companies that not only pay dividends, but also consistently increase their payout. As such, investors can enjoy rising current income while anticipating capital appreciation, irrespective of market conditions.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future and leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included. : This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history. : This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue. : This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history. : This represents the rate at which a company's earnings are expected to grow.

"As an investment sector, the Internet of Things, or IoT, is a no-brainer. Increasingly, our consumer devices no longer have a specific function or operation; rather, they're part of an integrated, digital ecosystem that responds to variable requests. This movement will  and engagement, but picking the right IoT stock can be a challenge.That's because no single definition of an IoT stock exists. Typically, financial writers focus on big semiconductor names like  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ). The connection is readily apparent: these major tech manufacturers produce the physical components that go into IoT devices. But you're also likely to gain serious profits through investing in renowned device-makers and distributors like  (NASDAQ:  ).Going with the blue chips is the most popular way to pursue an IoT stock. Personally, I have zero complaints about this approach. But I'd also like to give some lesser known or less appreciated IoT companies some love.It's a big market, and it's only going to get bigger. Thus, it's an opportune time to get acclimated with the other names in the sector.Here are my choices for the best alternative Internet of Things stocks:As a multi-faceted organization,  (NYSE:  ) is probably the most comprehensive IoT stock available in the markets; it just doesn't get as much coverage as a sector player as you might expect. I find this strange considering that they make common home products, such as thermostats, air conditioners and security systems, that scream IoT.Honeywell is also a leader in  , or IIoT. Again, this is probably one of the lesser-appreciated components of the Internet of Things, which largely focuses on consumer goods. But IIoT has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing as we know it, improving efficiencies, providing real-time data analysis, and reducing the frequency and impact of human error.The one major knock on HON as an IoT stock is that it's somewhat of a bellwether investment. In other words, HON is incredibly boring. Plus, shares have generally tracked the broader markets recently, which has produced uninspiring results.But if you're not looking for a sexy play and want something stable, HON is one of your top choices.I mentioned previously that the most popular IoT stock tends to be either a semiconductor firm or device manufacturer. These are natural choices considering that they're direct plays. However, IoT also serves a defensive or protective role. That's why if you love this sector, you should check out  (NYSE:  ).ADT is a name you immediately recognize, either because you're enrolled in their security services or you have their sign planted conspicuously on your front yard. Earlier this year, our own Tom Taulli covered ADT and its initial public offering. He provided some background about the company,  :""ADT, whose roots go back to 1874, is the most recognized brand in its industry. A survey indicates that it has about 95% awareness with consumers. This is certainly a big-time advantage as the market is highly competitive.Keep in mind that ADT controls about 30% of the residential market in the U.S. and Canada. In all, there are 7.2 million residential and business customers.""That sounds spectacular. Unfortunately for early bird investors, ADT is down sharply from its IPO price, as Wall Street reassessed its competitive risks.ADT is speculative, no doubt about it. Still, with a year-to-date loss of 34%, I like it as a contrarian opportunity.When we discuss the Internet of Things, we often think small and personal. We consider devices that adjust our home's temperature automatically, or devices that give us the ability to warm-up our cars from afar. Not to take away from these consumer innovations, but they also limit what IoT can do broadly.For an IoT stock with a much larger framework, check out  (NYSE:  ). While not exactly the most popular household name, Johnson Controls corporate heritage extends back to the 19th century. Today, the company is known for its build-management and safety systems. Additionally, JCI features a battery and distributed-energy storage divisions.A significant concern about JCI stock, though, focuses on its fundamentals, which are middling. The company has also tacked on more debt, which makes it difficult to invest in future innovations. As a result, JCI shares are down almost 8% YTD.That said, JCI appears to have found a baseline of support after hitting a year-low in late April. Given its massive resources, and penchant for technological advancements, Johnson Controls is a solid bet.Similar to other innovations, some organizations are guilty of using IoT as a buzzword, and nothing else. This reminds me of the blockchain: everybody talks about it, but few understand what it is, and even fewer offer practical solutions with it.Thankfully,  (NYSE:  ) rises above the hype, delivering scalable IIoT solutions for the world's top industries. EMR has particularly found success with large oil and energy corporations as they shift toward next-generation technologies. Moreover, Emerson Electric offers training services to help their clients get the best out of the IIoT movement.Like many of the names mentioned on this list, EMR stock hasn't generated much excitement this year. Shares have been choppy, but have so far only broken even. But I expect this circumstance to change. After having some rough years, Emerson Electric is firmly in recovery territory. Last quarter, the company generated $4.25 billion in sales, up nearly 19% YoY.Computer-networking firm  (NASDAQ:  ) has largely earned its reputation through selling popular routers and firewalls. In addition, the company sells storage devices, and owns a security-camera business with its spin-off organization, Arlo. This synergy of connectivity-related expertise makes NTGR one of the more exciting opportunities among IoT stocks.The evidence lies in its market performance. On a YTD basis, NTGR shares are up over 32%. While I'm not the biggest fan of buying into extreme strength, its fundamentals justify the premium. Definitely, if NTGR stock hits a corrective phase, you should immediately put it on your must-watch list.For starters, NetGear has demonstrated consistently strong earnings performances. The last time the company failed to meet expectations was back in the second quarter of 2015. Since then, management has beaten their earnings-per-share estimates.NTGR is a distinct IoT stock in that it has a strong balance sheet with zero debt on its books. That enables its leadership team to invest in research and development, giving it a leg-up on the competition. Finally, the company has enjoyed robust revenue growth, which should continue due to increased sector demand.With a name like  (NASDAQ:  ), ADI doesn't seem to fit the description of an IoT stock. Yet don't let initial appearances fool you: Analog Devices have built some of the most groundbreaking semiconductor technologies for commercial industries and scientific endeavors.What's more, ADI refreshingly focuses not just on IoT for its own sake, but as a comprehensive solution. Their products and services ensure both technical connectivity, as well as relevant and accurate data analysis and transmission.According to their  , you're only as strong as your weakest link. Therefore, management expends significant effort to create seamless communication among the ""things"" of an IoT network.Another component of ADI's investment potential is its growth metrics. For instance, its profitability margins are ranked among the best semiconductor firms. The company's three-year revenue growth rate averages 17.4%, and that doesn't look to fade anytime soon. In Analog Devices' last earnings report, it delivered $1.51 billion in sales, up a whopping 32% YOY.I've saved my most speculative idea for an alternative IoT stock for last.  (NYSE:  ) captured the wildly popular fitness market's attention with their quirky advertisements and killer products. When the company first hit its stride, no one could get enough of their fitness trackers. Now, with fierce competition from Garmin and  (NASDAQ:  ), Fitbit appears merely an also-ran.As I said in my  about FIT stock, I don't blame you if you take that argument. Since its IPO, and especially since its early run-up, FIT has become an unmitigated disaster. Even when shares fell into the teens, and optimists like yours truly considered it a contrarian opportunity, Fitbit still disappointed.But if you've been paying attention, you'll know that FIT stock dramatically reversed its ugliness. On a YTD basis, shares are up over 15%. Of course, most people regard this as a bull-trap. I think there's still significant upside remaining.That's because Fitbit focuses almost exclusively on fitness trackers, whereas its competitors are encumbered with various and sometimes disparate markets. Furthermore, Fitbit features a popular user ecosystem that's difficult to replicate.FIT stock is by no means a sure thing, but it has enough good qualities to justify a calculated risk.Discovered almost by accident, Louis Navellier's incredible trading breakthrough has delivered 148 double- and triple-digit winners over the past 5 years - including a stunning 487% win in just 10 months.Learn to use this formula and you can start turning every $10,000 invested  . to review Louis' urgent presentation.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 Alternative Internet of Things Stocks to Buy@2018-07-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-alternative-internet-of-things-stocks-to-buy-2018-07-17

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 1.6 % in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Analog Devices Inc. reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.45 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. The bottom line surged 41% year over year and 3% sequentially. Also, the figure surpassed the guided range of $1.30-$1.44.Revenues of $1.51 billion topped the consensus mark of $1.47 billion and came close to the higher end of the guided range of $1.43-$1.51 billion. Moreover, the top line surged 32% year over year but remained flat sequentially.The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a robust performance from the industrial, automotive and communications end-markets.Industrial (52% of the total revenues) revenues soared 47% year over year and 6% sequentially to $788.3 million.Communications (19% of the total revenues) revenues surged 34% year over year and 1% sequentially to $287.9 million.Automotive (16% of the total revenues) revenues jumped 28% from the year-ago quarter but were down 6% from the last reported quarter to $238.8 million.Consumer (13% of the total revenues) revenues declined 6% year over year and 17% sequentially to $198.1 million.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 200 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis and 30 bps sequentially to 71.3%.Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 220 bps from the year-ago quarter and 20 bps sequentially to 29.2%.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 420 bps on a year-over-year basis and 40 bps sequentially to 42.1%.Analog Devices exited the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $806.5 million, down from $827.6 million at the end of the prior quarter.Long-term debt was approximately $6.93 billion, down from $7.38 billion at the end of the last reported quarter.Net cash provided by operations was $718.5 million, up from $388.7 million reported in the fiscal first quarter.For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Analog Devices expects revenues between $1.47 billion and $1.55 billion. Analog Devices projects interest and other expense of approximately $58 million. Earnings are expected in the band of $1.38-$1.52 per share.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been 12 revisions higher for the current quarter. | At this time, ADI has a nice Growth Score of B. Its Momentum is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is primarily suitable for momentum investors while also being suitable for those looking for growth and to a lesser degree value.Estimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.92), with the stock changing hands as low as $95.05 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

 (NASDAQ: ADI) is showing no signs of slowing down. The chipmaker has strung together a series of impressive results over the past few quarters, recording terrific growth across all of its business segments thanks to the massive demand for its chips that are used for processing analog and digital signals between devices.For instance, the company's top line jumped 32% year over year to $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Gross margin expanded two percentage points, and net income nearly quadrupled. But what's so impressive about Analog is that it expects to carry forward this impressive momentum with the help of the positive demand trends it's witnessing in the industrial, automotive, and communications business.aImage Source: Getty Images.Analog Devices' industrial, automotive, and communications businesses together supply 87% of its revenue. Industrial is the biggest of the lot with 52% of the top line, and the great part about this business is that it grew 47% year over year during the latest quarter.Such terrific growth there was driven by Analog's acquisition of Linear Technology, completed in March of last year. At that time, Analog had claimed that the combined company's total addressable market will increase to $14 billion from $8 billion given its highly complementary portfolios.As such, the massive jump in its industrial business that supplies the bulk of the revenue shouldn't be surprising, as it's now in a better position to take on the fast-growing factory automation market. As it turns out, industrial was Linear's forte -- it used to generate half of its revenue by supplying semiconductors to factory automation and equipment manufacturers.Automation is a hot buzzword in the industrial sector now, as it allows for a reduction in human error and improves the operational efficiency of factory processes. So it isn't surprising to see why the factory automation market is expected to nearly double in size over the next seven years, according to Transparency Market Research.Meanwhile, the communications business is sitting on a huge catalyst in the form of fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology, the transition to which has already begun. The telecom industry is taking its first steps toward 5G with the help of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technology, which allows carriers to increase data transfer speeds while keeping costs under check.Analog Devices is helping telecom carriers in this transition with its transceivers, chips that are capable of both sending and receiving signals. These chips address  of capacity and cost that carriers are facing while deploying 5G networks, thanks to their lower power consumption and the ability to pack in more radio cards to boost signal capacity.Now, CCS Insight estimates that the number of 5G connections could jump from around 60 million in 2020 to 2.7 billion in 2025. Telecom carriers are reportedly looking to start deployments earlier than expected, so investments in equipment such as transceivers could take off in the next few years and help boost the stature of Analog's communications business.In all, Analog Devices looks set to keep growing on the back of  , but this is just one of the reasons to love the stock. Analog also trades at just 17x forward earnings, which is half the industry average. Furthermore, its annual dividend yield of 2% is  on average.The company's earnings power should continue to improve with widening margins -- management expects gross margin to go up another 50 to 150 basis points in the current quarter as compared to the prior-year period, which should flow down to the bottom line.Analog Devices currently pays out nearly a third of its earnings in the form of the dividend. Additionally, dividend payments accounted for 36% of its free cash flow in the previous fiscal year. So it can be said that Analog has a fairly safe payout, which leaves it room to boost the dividend in the coming years as earnings grow.This is a triple-threat company with a fast-growing, dividend-paying stock available at an attractive valuation, and it's one that investors shouldn't miss.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (Symbol: SPYG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $38.14 per unit.With SPYG trading at a recent price near $34.79 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.64% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPYG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (Symbol: MLM), and Amphenol Corp. (Symbol: APH). Although ADI has traded at a recent price of $96.50/share, the average analyst target is 11.31% higher at $107.41/share. Similarly, MLM has 10.91% upside from the recent share price of $219.77 if the average analyst target price of $243.75/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting APH to reach a target price of $95.50/share, which is 10.70% above the recent price of $86.27.

In comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year over year results.Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release and on our web schedules which will be posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com.Okay? So, with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche. -- Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Well, the second quarter of Fiscal 18 was remarkable for ADI. We posted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share above the high-end of our guidance and set a new high watermark in free cashflow generation and I'm pleased to share some perspective on our results with you now.So, revenue in the second quarter came in just above the high-end of our guidance, as strength across our B2B markets, especially in the industrial and communication sectors offset the expected decline in consumer. Our results were also supported by our Linear Tech franchise, which posted a record revenue quarter.Growth and operating margin expanded substantially compared to the year ago quarter, driving a more than 40% increase year over year in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. This execution resulted in record free cashflow in the quarter under combined company adjusted free cashflow margins over the trailing 12 months continue to place us in the highest tier of the S&P 500.Now, before we go deeper into our financial performance, I'd like to take this opportunity to provide investors with a deeper perspective on some of our key technology and market trends and ADI's strategy relative to them. I've spoken before about the dawn of the third wave of information and communications technology or ICT, which is characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyper scale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity.In this world, digital systems increasingly rely on real world information to make mission critical decisions and the accuracy and the integrity of this information is becoming more and more important. Simultaneously, the actual challenge of identifying and extracting signals in the presence of increasing levels of noise is becoming harder.Now, I believe that this is creating an inflection in the analog industry and it's enabling ADI to play a critical role in generating and communicating high quality information to leverage our cutting-edge innovation and solutions to tackle our customers' hardest problems, from sensor to cloud, microwave to bits, and nanobots to kilowatts.It's our ability to sense, measure, interpret, power, and connect these two worlds that is helping to enable autonomous machines, natural human to machine interaction, and future important technologies such as virtual and augmented reality and so on.Today, though, I'd like to talk more specifically about connectivity and 5G, which has been the subject of much news coverage lately and which represents the next big investment phase in wireless infrastructure and how we view its evolution and timing. In fact, an entirely new wireless and wireline network architecture will ultimately be needed to meet the demands for orders of magnitude increases in bandwidth-hungry areas, such as high-definition video streaming.Although 5G will provide revolutionary capabilities, the transition to 5G will be evolutionary. We see the first phase of this evolution being the edition of massive MIMO, which will provide a significant increase to the capacity of the current 4G wireless network. The use case and benefits of massive MIMO to the carriers are real. A massive MIMO system can deliver a greater than 3X data capacity increase in the same spectrum as a current 4G bay station.This helps to solve two large challenges for carriers -- capacity and cost. ADI is enabling these massive MIMO implementations today through our highly integrated, software-defined transceiver platform. This solution reduces the radio card area by a factor of 10 and overall remote radio head footprint by 50%, while simultaneously reducing power consumption. These are critical success factors with massive MIMO systems since they use on average the number of eight times the number of radios compared to today's systems.Equally important, these transceivers have the flexibility to operate from 300 megahertz to 6 gigahertz as they are software programmable, giving our customers a single platform-based design that can quickly be modified to operate in any of the many different cellular bands that exist around the world.These radios can also scale from small cells to macro bay stations to massive MIMO radios and they offer a flexible architecture capable of right-sizing the analog and digital performance needed by a customer's product family.However, to realize the longer-term 5G ambition, further network change is needed. In order to further expand the network bandwidth, millimeter wave solutions will come into play in order to provide multi gigabyte per second wireless connectivity using phased array solutions.In that arena, ADI is leveraging the capabilities from our Hittite acquisition. We have a very unique market position of having deep competency from antenna to bits up through millimeter waves, and our solutions and technologies are well-positioned in the current millimeter wave trials around the world. This will expand ADI's sun as it emerges.In addition to adding massive MIMO and millimeter waves, 5G will require a complete rearchitecting of the core wireless and wireline network, including a move toward network virtualization and more edge computing. This backbone network will be required to meet the 5G vision of greater than 1 gigabyte per second download speeds, low latency, and high reliability demanded by mission critical applications, such as digital healthcare, autonomous vehicles, fully autonomous factory floors, and augmented reality systems.This network expansion will drive a significant upgrade of the of the backhaul system, opening a new stream of opportunity for ADI's optical and point to point microwave solutions. 5G represents an enormous opportunity for ADI, as we are uniquely positioned to provide the enabling technology through our comprehensive portfolio of high-performance mixed signal, RF and microwave, and power management technologies.The combination and integration of these innovative capabilities will allow us to create even more comprehensive and compelling signal change solutions for our customers and the opportunity to capture up to three times the bomb when compared to our 4G solutions.Now, while we're obviously excited about the remarkable potential of 5G, the greater volume of our communications business in the next couple of years will still be 4G. Here, our business is strong and has been growing at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth has significantly outpaced industry CapEx spend, as we have seen share gains in traditional products thanks to new RF offerings resulting from the combined strength of our ADI and Hittite engineering teams. Those results have been augmented by strong adoption of our integration software-defined transceivers across macro, small cells, and massive MIMO trials.So, in summary, we feel very confident and energized by our communications market success, which is built upon close partnerships with our customers, our domain known how, our unwavering desire to solve the toughest engineering challenges, and strategic investments in research and development, along, of course, with our acquisitions of Hittite and Linear Technology. So, looking forward, we expect to continue to outperform in the communications market and accelerate our growth as we fully address our customers' needs well into the 5G future.Of course, 5G is just one of the many areas ADI is taking advantage of in the era of digitalization. In this ubiquitously sensed and connected world, there are many exciting new opportunities, areas such as industrial 4.0, autonomous and electric transportation, and cloud computing. And in future earnings calls, I will continue to speak to these opportunities with you and look forward to sharing how we are creating long-term value for our customers and for our shareholders.And so, with that, I'd like to hand over to Prashanth. -- Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our Fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. With the exception of non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L line items will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Revenue for the quarter was just over $1.51 billion. Above the high-end of our guidance year over year and up 7% sequentially on a 13-week basis.Now, before I move on to the rest of the P&L, let me give you some commentary around our market performance in the quarter. Looking at the combined company, our B2B company increased 14% year over year, led by double-digit growth in the industrial and communications markets. The industrial end market represented 52% of sales in the quarter.Growth in this market was, once again, broad-based, with nearly all applications and geographies increasing double digits compared to the year ago quarter. Momentum continues as our targeted R&D investments aimed at the underlying sector trends of automation, instrumentation, and healthcare continue to drive outperformance.Turning to the comms market, which represented 19% of sales in the second quarter -- sales into both wireless and wired applications increased compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, our wireless business has increased at a high single-digit rate over the trailing 12 months. Our growth is due to share gains related to our complete portfolio of high-performance mixed signal, RF, and microwave, as well as the strong demand for our integrated transceiver and our position on virtually all of the 5G and massive MIMO trials.As Vince mentioned, we expect to grow our comms revenue at a mid-single-digit rate in the backdrop of a flat CapEx environment ahead of 5G rollouts and 5G represents an enormous opportunity at ADI, as we are positioned to provide the enabling technology with our comprehensive portfolio.Our auto business represented 16% of sales in the quarter after a better than seasonal first quarter. Second quarter sales increased at a low single-digit rate compared to the year ago quarter, with growth led by the infotainment and power train applications.Finally, our consumer business, representing 13% of sales in the second quarter and as previously communicated, decreased compared to our year ago quarter.Let me now move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margins of 71.3% came in around the midpoint of guidance and increased slightly compared to the first quarter on a more favorable mix. OpEx in the second quarter was $442 million or approximately 29% of revenue. Strong revenue growth combined with operational execution delivered operating margins above 42% and at the upper end of our guidance. Non-op expenses in the second quarter were $62.5 million. We expect our non-op expenses to be approximately $58 million in our third quarter and to decline by $2 million to $3 million in our fourth quarter of Fiscal 18.Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 5% as we adjusted the tax rate for the full year to 6%. Looking to the third and fourth quarters, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate will remain between 5% to 7%. There is no change to our expectation for Fiscal 2019 and we continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be approximately 12%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter came in above the high-end of guidance at $1.45 increasing over 40% year over year.Now I'll cover the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory decrease 2% sequentially and days were 116 in the quarter, down from 124 days in the first quarter. Distribution inventory was approximately seven and half weeks, which is flat sequentially and up slightly compared to the year ago quarter.We generated record free cash flow of approximately $665 million in the quarter with associated free cashflow margins of 44%. And in the trailing 12 months, adjusted cashflow for the combined enterprise was $1.9 billion.During the quarter, we paid down $450 million of debt, which helped reduce our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 2.2 times, down from the 2.4 times from the prior quarter. We expect to achieve our two times leverage ratio within the next two quarters. Capital additions in the second quarter were $54 million and we expect CapEx for Fiscal 18 to run at our model of approximately 4% of sales and during the quarter, we paid $178 million in dividends with an associated quarterly cash dividend of $0.48, representing an annual dividend payment of $1.92 per outstanding share of common stock.So, let's now turn to our outlook and expectations for the third quarter of Fiscal 18, which, with the exception of revenue, are also on a non-GAAP basis and exclude items outlined in today's release. At a high-level, we're expecting third quarter to look a lot like second quarter. We're planning for revenue in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. At the midpoint of guidance, we expect our B2B markets of industrial, auto, and comms in the aggregate to increase approximately 10% year over year.We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the year ago quarter. We expect our operating expenses to be flat to up to $10 million year over year. At the midpoint of guidance, this implies OpEx as a percentage of sales of approximately 29%. Based on these inputs, we expect operating margins in the third quarter 2018 to be in the range of 41% to 43% and for diluted earnings per share excluding special items to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.52.So, to wrap it up, this was another terrific quarter for ADI and we set a few records along the way. Our B2B business increased double digits year over year and our strong operational execution drove gross and operating margins higher, which resulted in a record free cashflow in the quarter.With that, I'll turn it over to Mike for our Q&A session. -- Thanks, Prashanth. Now let's get to our Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response, we'll give you the opportunity for a follow up question. Jennifer, can we have our first question, please?For those participating by telephone, dial in. If you have a question, please press * and the number 1 on your phone. If your question has been answered and you wish to be removed from the queue, please press the # key. If you are listening on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking your question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.Our first question comes from Tory Vonberg with Stifel. --  -- Thank you and congratulations on the strong results. First question for Vince -- you talked about participating in 5G trials. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? It sounded like you were participating in all of them out there, but if you could give some context, that would be great. -- Yeah. Thanks, Tory. Well, as I said in the prepared remarks, there are really two phases to 5G, at least from an ADI, perspective, there's the pre-millimeter phase and the millimeter phase. The pre-millimeter phase is really dominated by this massive MIMO expansion, which is really an overlay on 4G.So, our software defined transceivers are absolutely everywhere in the systems that are being brought to market this year and next year. In fact, it's one of the fastest-growing product sectors inside ADI. So, that's been a very strong contributor to our communications business and, in fact, beyond. These transceiver technologies, because they're so flexible are usable as well in places beyond communications.Also, the combination of Hittite and ADI from RF to bits and microwave to bits is enabling us to capture new content in pre-5G systems, but it's the combination of our massive MIMO, our Hittite ADI microwave and millimeter wave to bits technology that is enabling us to be participating in virtually all these field trials across the globe.My sense, Tory, is the US and China will be in the kind of '19, '20 timeframe we'll be at least trialing some particular applications. China will get faster to mass market with what they call 5G, which is really 4.5G plus massive MIMO. So, I hope that explains what it is we're doing. In the run up to what will be pure 5G 2025 timeframe, where the core network gets changes with virtualization, edge computing and pure millimeter wave-type technologies spanning different frequency levels. -- Thanks, Tory, do you have a follow-up? -- Yeah, just to follow up with percent -- percent with the gross margin being up year over year, is that mainly a function of mix or is there any other contributors there? Obviously, the revenues are slightly higher but is the main upside to gross margin year over year coming from mix? -- Sure. Well, Tory, remember that we have now completed the implementation of all of our synergies related to the acquisition of Linear. We have built into our run rate the cost synergies that we committed to at the time of the acquisition. That is contributing as well to the gross margin strength. I would also say that with volumes where they are, we're getting the benefit of strong utilization of at our internal FABs. -- Thank you so much. -- I'll just add that we have an additional $100 million of cost centers we talked about, so $150 million is complete and we still have another $150 on the comm. --  -- Thank you. -- Can we have our next question please?Our next comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. --  -- Yeah, good morning, guys. Can we hear me? -- Good morning, John. You're a little find, but good morning. --  -- Hey, Vince, really appreciate all the color on the comm decisions, but I wanted to talk about your auto business. You had really strong growth in the January quarter that decelerated pretty significantly in the April quarter, which was a little bit surprising, especially, as you said in your prepared comments, the Linear business was achieving you all-time records. I'm just kind of curious.You have been under-growing your peers in autos, which was explainable over multiple years because of the MEMS part of your business, but that should be a fairly small part of the business now. I'm, just curious as to what's holding back growth in that market and then how you feel your long-term position is in the auto space. -- Yeah. Thanks, John. Our long-term goal is to grow at the high end of two to three SIR. Our objective obviously is to get the combined company onto that trajectory. Obviously, we performing below my expectations. We're not happy as a management team. Let me try to unpack this story a bit for you and bring you through where we are right now and what the pathway ahead is going to be. So, we were clear on our last call that the growth profiles for ADI and LTC are quit different in the automotive sector today.ADI, the legacy business increased at the level of 2 to 3 SAR in '17 and it looks like we're on track again this year to achieve that kind of level, whereas the LTC has been low single digits according and we're engaged today on almost every self-driving platform that is in development today, both with what we would call traditional OEMs and some disruptors out there as well.That technology, which we've been using -- we've gained traction in mission-critical aerospace areas, for example, it's a really ideal fit to the emerging autonomous vehicle requirements and it's sued as a fail safe function in the event of a regular system failure.I will turn to the electrification side of things and our BMS business, which we got from our LTC acquisition. We've been winning back business we might have lost or had lost by changing our business logic, as I talked earlier about, tilting toward growth, defending our sockets aggressively and also leveraging the scale and flexibility of the ADI manufacturing system to change the cost profile of the products.We're broadening LTC's customer base into the strong relationship that legacy ADI has with North America and with European OEMs. Also our next generation BMS will improve on our already leading performance levels by delivering, again, more miles per charge and bringing all the robustness and safety features to play as well.One other aspect of the electrification business is the momentum that we have in our isolation. We have a franchise of very unique isolation technologies that tend to get used anytime that there's a high voltage and low voltage connection. These technologies are very important in electrical vehicles, so I think we're doing well there, not to mention the broad-based revenue synergies we've got on the power side of things.In a reasonable period of time, we should be able to add a point or two of overall growth to the automotive business given the design cycles that we've got and the strength of the power portfolio. I think we're very focused on bending the growth curve, then if we're focused on the right apps, the right customers, we have a terrific technology story. With the complementary customer bases and geo footprint coverage, I feel very optimistic about the future and our ability to get that growth curve to where we have publicly said it should be and will be. I know that's a long answer, John, but I thought it was important to give the story in terms of where we are today and talk a little bit about the future as well. -- Thanks, John. In the interest of getting more callers on the call, we're going to move to our next call, Jennifer.Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. --  -- Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Thanks, especially, for the robust answers in particular around wireless 5G. But there's a controversy brewing in that market with these decisions around ZTE, as to whether you might or might not be able to ship components to them. I'm wondering two questions about that -- one, what does your outlook assume in terms of sales to ZTE going forward? Second, how would a stop ship order to ZTE influence your view as to the growth of that market overall? In particular, might we see a slowdown of adoption in China if they don't have two local champions. Thank you. -- Yeah. Thanks for the question. The way we view it, in the short-term, there's a certain amount of fixed CapEx in place to upgrade the various networks across the globe. We have factored into our numbers a potential continued embargo with regard to ZTE. It's built into our numbers. It was a small amount of headwind for the company last quarter. I think overall, most geos are up. In communications for ADI, we're gaining share. You know, my sense is as well, we're obviously staying close to the situation, as best we can tell, the negotiation outcomes that are taking place.But I will tell you clearly US and China need each other. I think trade between both is very, very critical. My sense is that sense will prevail and the need for free trade, unencumbered trade will prevail. We're expecting political leaders to figure this out. My sense is at the end of the day, there's demand there for more and more connectivity. Carriers are determined to keep building their networks out, to capture the opportunity, build revenue and profit streams. That demand is going to be fulfilled one way or the other. -- Thanks, Will. I think you put two questions in there, so we'll move to the next caller.Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. --  -- Yes, thank you, question on consumer -- you appear to be navigating the fall of at your largest customer. So, just from a high level if you could look at the puts and takes and some of the drop off there versus other opportunities and areas where you're actually growing within consumer. -- So, as you know, Craig, we've got two different stories there. One is our prosumer, which looks a lot like our B2B market with lots of products and different applications globally. That business has been strengthened as well with the addition of the LTC revenue applications. That's in the $300+ million area, so it's a significant portion of consumer for ADI. We're expecting looking into our back end of third quarter and fourth quarter what is normally a seasonably strong quarter to be so.We've stated previously that consumer will be down 20% to 30% for the year. This is how the year appears to be trending now. So, our strategy remains the same, to leverage our technologies into areas of very, very high differentiation where we can get a high return on investment and we continue to execute against that strategy. -- Thank you, Craig. Do you have a follow-up? --  -- I do. Thank you. Just a question on free cashflow and capital allocation, encouraging to see the big step up of free cashflow in the quarter. As you're on the doorstep of that two turns target for net leverage, can you remind us, in terms of just priorities, acquisitions versus returning cash and how you think about that. -- Yes. It was a great quarter for us in free cashflow, but I do want to remind folks that our cashflow can be lumpy quarter to quarter. So, the right way to measure us is on a trailing 12 months. We finished this quarter with trailing 12-month of $1.9 billion. So, we recognized that this franchise throws up a considerable amount of cash and therefore, we want to be very thoughtful on how we deploy that excess cash once we achieve our 2X leverage ratio, which we would expect to do in the next two quarters. We are very thoughtful on how we deploy that excess cash once we achieve our 2X leverage ratio, which we would expect to do in the next two quarters.We are very mindful of the debt that we took on as a result of the Linear acquisition as well as the opportunities that we have in front of us with share repurchase, dividend, and potentially some other uses as well. It's something we spend quite a bit of time internally debating and I think you'll hear from us in a coming earnings release as we're ready to talk more about our capital allocation strategy once we clear that important 2X threshold. -- Thank you, Craig. Jennifer, can we have our next caller?Our next question is from CJ Muse with Evercore. --  -- Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Sorry for those Celts. I guess if I could combine my questions into one large one -- on the industrial side, could you share with us a little bit more detail in terms of what the drivers were there underlying that superb growth. Then can you talk about the sustainability of that growth going forward. Longer-term, as part of revenue synergies with linear, clearly auto has been a major focus, but could you kind of, I guess, help us see what kind of underlying growth we could see in that segment looking out the next one, two, three years. Thank you. -- Thanks for the question, CJ. The industrial business has been doing extraordinarily well. As you mention, we continue to be driving this with the technology investments that we've made. It is across the board, CJ. It is all geographies. It is all products. This is really a combination of the strength of the global expanding environment.You know the PMI continues to be in an expansionary phase and that's compounded by the technology investments that have been made over the last several years which have now come together at a time where you can really see the driver in automation. You can see the driver in our instrumentation business. So, it's really across the board and it's hard to point to any other particular segment because it is so broad-based and it's a reflection of the investments that have been made over the last several years.From where we sit today and you can see it reflected in our guidance for the coming quarter, we feel very strong about the coming quarter, the outlook is solid. Our book to bill is greater than one. Information from the channels, the information Vince gets form his customer visits are going to continue to tell us we're going to see this run for a bit longer. -- Thanks, CJ. I'll also remind you our long-term growth running that business and we think that's a great growth -- 50% of our business and throws off great cash. Do you have a follow up, CJ? Actually, you fit in two questions there. Let's move to the next caller.Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. -- Thank you, good morning. First question, a little bit of a big picture question. Based on the comments of the prior question, it sounds like you do have a good degree of conviction that the favorable conditions will continue. Can you talk about the visibility you have to customer inventory levels into channel inventory, generally with mid to strong industry conditions, the ability you have to make sure customers are ordering in line with their needs and not over-ordering at this point. -- Thanks for the question. First, as a reminder, we have not moved to ASE 606. So, remember that our revenue is recognized on sell through from the channels. So, we really do provide our investors of what is the actual activity happening at the customer level.The inventory that we're seeing in our channel now, roughly seven and a half weeks, that's relatively consistent with where we have been. We would expect through the normal course of the rest of the fiscal year, we'd expect to see that come down a bit. The inventory that we have in house is at 116 days. That's the improvement of about 8 days from where we were in the first quarter. We are comfortable in that 115 to 120.So, I think that's where you'll see us with the balance of the period. Our sales organization does work very closely with channel partners to monitor that order activity to ensure that we're being mindful of the order lead times and ensuring that behavior is appropriate, but the biggest metric for us is the revenue we're reporting is on sell through. So, it's really not impacted by any noise in the channel, whether they're building or subtracting from inventory. -- Just another bit of color on that -- all the macroeconomics that I talked about at the start of my prepared remarks there benefit the industrial sector. My sense is from talking to customers globally, as has been the case at least for the last couple of years, they're pragmatically optimistic about the future, that we're in the longer term various applications in industrial and I think the optimism is even across automation, instrumentation, and the aerospace and defense areas. I think our customers are feeling good. I'm also feeling very, very good about where are and where the market is. -- Jennifer, can we move to our next caller in the ineptest of time?Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Vince, thanks for all the wireless comps commentary earlier in the call. I just wanted to level set -- how does your 20% roughly coms business split between the wireless and the wired side. Given that you gave us all that color on the wireless side, I wondered what your expectations were for the wired part of the equation. -- Good question, Ross. Thank you. Today, with the acquisition of LT, our business now is about 50-50 between wireless and wireline. The wireless business, my sense is that can grow in the high single digits for quite a while to come. That's my long-term growth objective in that business. And you know, wired is somewhere in the mid-single digits as it has been growing. I think that's a reasonable way to balance the growth expectations across that business. -- Do you have a follow-up, Ross? -- Yeah. I'll make it a quick one for you. Vince, you mentioned a few times in this call about changing the business model at Linear to be a little more growth-centric. Can you give us an idea, given the long-term design cycles, I know it's not going to be immediate, but when should we as investors see the benefit of those tweaks to the admittedly successful linear model turning to a little bit more growth-centric? -- I think the areas where we believe we see the growth uptick in the shorter term over the next two years, that will be in the probably communications as well as automotive areas. We have sockets already in place now that we should see the uptake on. To get to what I would consider to be the objective to put a couple points more total growth on the company's topline, it will take in the kind of two to four-year kind of area. If Hittite is any indication, given that the technologies play in similar markets, we're virtually four years into the closure of the Hittite acquisition. Over that period of time, we have managed to double the growth rate in that period of time.So, given, Ross, that we expect for every dollar of ADI, revenue, which is largely mixed signal based, we expect a dollar of power, that's the kind of opportunity spread we're looking at, but it's going to take two to four years to see meaningful change in the topline. -- Thank you, Ross. We'll move to our last caller.Our final question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Reilly. -- Thanks for sneaking me in. Vincent, thanks for the real tour-de-force on both auto and wireless. I wanted to follow up on Ross's comment and maybe take a longer-term look at the 5G opportunity that's in front of ADI. If we look back at the transition from 2G to 3G and then 3G to 4G, as you look ahead and look at 5G and potential for 5G to impact ADI revenues, the questions I have are one, how do you expect pacing in the 4G to 5G revenue transition to compare to prior transitions. When do you think we get to a point where 5G would be a majority of communications revenue? Relative to some of the growth rates that you talked about earlier on a subsegment basis, would you expect 5G when it becomes a much more material part of revenues to accelerate those growth rates. Thanks, Vincent. -- Yeah. Good question, Craig. If you consider 5G to be the initial introduction of 5G to be adding massive MIMO to 4G core network, I think we'll see meaningful revenue in the 2020 timeframe and I'd still think that 4G with massive MIMO will be a singularity portion of revenue into the 2022 timeframe. So, somewhere between 2022 and 2025 we'll start to see what we consider to see what we would consider 5G to become a more dominant part of our wireless communications infrastructure revenue.So, at this point, Craig, it's a bit of a guess based on trying to triangulate in all the various conversations we have with carriers and customers, but I think clearly, we're starting to see the uptick in 4.5G, or as it's called in China, 5G massive MIMO based on 4G infrastructure at this point. Hopefully, that helps to give a bit of clarity to you. -- Okay. Thank you, Jennifer and thank you, everyone for joining us this morning.

 is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. The company is solidly positioned in growth markets like industrial, auto and communication. Also its products continue to see very strong deployment in the emerging automotive market. Analog Devices has a well-diversified business that guarantee relatively steady revenues throughout the year.Analog Devices has been benefitting from strength across all the markets - industrial, automotive, consumer and communications, and increased focus on innovation and operational execution.

The stock, however, has slightly underperformed the industry in the past 12 months. It has gained 15.26% compared with the  's rally of 15.96%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices, one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits, generated revenues of $1.52 billion, down 1.5% sequentially but up 54.3% year over year. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a robust performance from industrial, automotive and communications end-markets.Analog Devices has been benefiting from strength in the markets of industrial, automotive, consumer and communications, and the increased focus on innovation and operational execution. While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and fending off competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.In March, Analog Devices acquired a privately held company, Symeo GmbH, for an undisclosed amount. The deal seems appealing because Symeo's signal processing algorithms offer high precision RADAR solutions. These solutions enable system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to work with great precision in rough industrial environments. The deal will likely improve the company's customer base and add to its growth.For the fiscal second quarter, management expects continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, and revenues in the range of $1.43-$1.51 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 71-71.5%. Operating expenses are expected between $430 million and $440 million.The company expects interest and other expenses of approximately $60 million, and earnings per share in the range of $1.30-$1.44.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat on earnings in the quarter to be reported.

 is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 18, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, Deere posted earnings of $1.31 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by around 13%. Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive earnings surprise of 17.25%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | For the fiscal second quarter, Deere expects sales to be up 30-40% year over year. The forecast includes a positive foreign-currency translation impact of about 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's sales is pegged at $9.75 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 34%. This upbeat projection reflects Deere's strong order activity.In addition, Deere stated that the Wirtgen acquisition will contribute about 16% to net sales for the quarter to be reported. Moreover, higher demand for large equipment and the positivity in agriculture-related government-sponsored finance programs supports the sales outlook for the fiscal second quarter.Our Consensus Estimates indicate that net sales of Deere's Agriculture and Turf equipment segment will reach $6.73 billion in the fiscal second quarter, rising around 16% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Construction & Forestry equipment sales is pegged at $2.58 billion for the quarter, reflecting year-over-year jump of 76%.

The tit-for-tat retaliatory policies are feared to hit U.S. farm exports and in turn, escalate the troubles of farm-equipment makers like Deere. Further, elevated expenses will impact its results.The company's price performance has been impressive over the past year.

 is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 14, after the closing bell. Notably, the company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the past four quarters. Vipshop has been gaining from rising consumer base, driven by increasing preference for online transactions. However, higher promotional costs have been a drag. With these aspects in mind, let's delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Vipshop has been consistently gaining from a growing consumer base. In fact, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the company's revenues surged 27.1% year over year, owing to a 4% rise in the number of active consumers. Moreover, to keep widening operations and consumer reach, the company actively undertook strategic investments, evident from its partnership with Tencent and JD.com.Apart from this, the company made investments in upgrading its technology to enhance the shopping experience of online customers. In this respect, the company launched programs such as the WeChat Mini Program in 2017 and released the trial version of WeChat Wallet in February. Additionally, to serve consumers efficiently, the company has undertaken warehouse expansion efforts, especially on the international front. Moreover, Vipshop continues to bolster its last-mile delivery services. Encouraged by such efforts, analysts polled by Zacks expect the company's revenues to surge 29.5% during first-quarter 2018 to reach $3,001 million. | Vipshop has long been grappling with rising promotional costs, amid a highly competitive online retail market. This has led to lower gross margin in the past few quarters, which has affected the company's profits. In the last reported quarter, gross margin declined 180 basis points. Although Vipshop has been trying to compensate rising promotional spending's with reductions in other marketing efforts, it is likely to continue hurting profitability. Additionally, the company's performance is expected to be dampened by costs associated with investments toward the expansion of the internet finance business, witnessed in the fourth quarter.Thanks to such deterrents, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the impending quarter is currently pegged at 13 cents per share, which depicts a decline of 31.6% from the prior-year quarter's figure. The current estimate has been stable over the last 30 days.All said, lets see what the Zacks Model reveals about Vipshop's upcoming quarterly release.Our proven model does not show that Vipshop is likely to beat estimates this quarter This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Although Vipshop carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Analog Devices, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Also, total payment in mPos segment grew 450% on a year-over-year basis.Further, units sold increased 68% from the prior-year quarter. This was attributed to Mercadolibre's free shipping program which benefited its customer base, although free shipping cost in the reported quarter increased 42.1% from the previous quarter which led to the sequential decline in revenues from this region. This market generated $101.9 million revenues (31.7% of revenues), which improved 42.7% year over year but declined 6.3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was attributed to improved GMV and units sold which grew 53% and 44% from the year-ago quarter, respectively. This was driven by free shipping and loyalty program called Mercado Puntos. Net revenues in the reported quarter were $17.1 million (5.3% of revenues), up 51.3% year over year but declined 3.4% sequentially.

Also GMV in this country reflected 58% surge from the year-ago quarter. In Columbia, GMV and units sold grew 44.6% and 68% year over year, respectively. | GMV of $3.1 billion increased 34% year over year (42.7% on an FX neutral basis) but decreased 13.9% sequentially.Total confirmed registered users at the end of the quarter were 223.1 million, improving 5.3% sequentially and 22.4% year over year.New confirmed registered users during the period were 11.2 million, increasing 4.8% sequentially and 38.3% on a year-over-year basis.Number of successful items sold was 80.1 million, down 1.3% sequentially but up 50.6% year over year.Number of successful items shipped increased 8.7% sequentially and 92.3% year over year to 52.5 million.

Among the largest underlying components of SMH, in trading today ASML Holding NV (Symbol: ASML) is off about 1.1%, Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is down about 0.4%, and Lam Research Corp (Symbol: LRCX) is lower by about 2%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SMH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SMH's low point in its 52 week range is $80.92 per share, with $114.55 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $105.03. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: SMH, ASML, ADI, LRCX@2018-05-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-smh-asml-adi-lrcx-2018-05-15
 is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 9.Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, while missing the same in the remaining two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 10.44%.In the last reported quarter, TripAdvisor reported a negative earnings surprise of 60%. Earnings of 6 cents per share declined 63% on a year-over-year basis and 84% sequentially.Revenues of $321 million were also down 26.9% on a sequential basis but increased 1.6% year over year. The company's year-over-year top line growth was benefited from strong growth in its non-hotel segment. However, it was adversely impacted by the sluggish performance of the hotel segment.Coming to the price performance, shares of TripAdvisor have returned 16.6% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the  's rally of 21.8%.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $360.8 million and that for earnings is projected at 16 cents.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.The company's growing marketing investments pose a risk. TripAdvisor's strategy of taking out online marketing spending from its investment bucket is denting online channel growth which happens to be an important growth driver. This is likely to lower revenue generation.Also, mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company's profits. TripAdvisor's selling and marketing expenditure in 2017 was $849 million, which increased 12% year over year.TripAdvisor's Hotel segment revenues of $244 million decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter and massively 21.8% on a sequential basis. However, this happens to be the company's main revenue contributor.Further, tough competition from major tech companies also remains a concern for the market position of the company.The company has revamped its website to provide travellers a site through which they can book hotels directly and not read reviews only. The move is expected to boost the company's clicked-based advertising and transaction revenues.TripAdvisor's strong customer base which includes major players of travel industry like Priceline and Expedia will continue to strengthen the company's hotel business by boosting traffic.Moreover, regular investment in hotel segment has been helping the company in improving the user experience in regard to price comparison.Further, with the ongoing shift from offline to online system in the market place, the non-hotel segment of the company is poised to reap benefits from the increasing demand.Additionally, TripAdvisor's mobile monetization initiative bode well for its increasing revenue per shopper on phone which is likely to continue in the going-to-be reported quarter as well. Also, efforts on improving the site design and to offer better products on phone will improve the shopper experience. This will improve the shopper base which will in turn aid the top-line growth.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

 is set to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on May 9.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.89%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.11 per share, down 25.5% from the year-ago quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues of $430 million also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $433 million and declined 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.For fiscal third-quarter 2018, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $380--$420 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synaptic is likely to benefit from its diversification strategy. In the last reported quarter, consumer IoT business, which accounted for nearly 25% of total revenues, was a breather.Notably, the acquisitions of Conexant Systems and Multimedia Solutions Business of Marvell Technology Group are helping it expand its customer base.In the IoT space, AudioSmart, ImagingSmart and VideoSmart are gaining wide scale adoption. New design wins in IoT are expected to provide further impetus.Synaptics' focus on enhancing in-display fingerprint sensing, Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) and OLED DDIC portfolio will help it counter the growing headwinds. The company expects the introduction of chip-on-film to provide new growth opportunity.However, declining revenues from mobile and PC products continue to hurt.

In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, matched it once and fell short of the same on one occasion. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Symantec's continuous efforts to strengthen its product suite are likely to benefit its top line, given the surge in demand for cybersecurity-related products. Recently, the company announced that it is enhancing security for Microsoft's  Azure and Office 365 products.Additionally, the company has been gaining from its acquisition initiatives, which are broadening its customer base and enhancing its capabilities in identity protection, a huge concern for almost every sector, be it financials, retail or technology. The buyouts have helped it reduce its dependency on the PC market and strengthen position in the enterprise security market.However, we remain slightly cautious about the company's lower-than-expected revenues in the last reported quarter due to a faster-than-expected booking mix shift toward more ""ratable revenue recognition.""

In the last reported quarter, ad revenues, which accounted for 95.5% of total revenues, increased 18.1% from the year-ago quarter to $208.4 million. This was driven by the fastest growing self-serve channel, followed by national and local. Paying advertiser accounts grew 7600 sequentially to reach 163K and increased 21% year over year.Moreover, Yelp is benefiting from its partnership with GrubHub Inc.  . Higher-than-expected revenue per order from Eat24, which was divested to Grubhub in October 2017, drove results in the last reported quarter.The collaboration provides users with access to a significant number of restaurants available for food ordering on the platform, which is expected to boost transaction revenues.Further, expansion in customer base of Yelp Reservations, Nowait and Yelp Wi-Fi marketing is a positive. Increasing adoption of Request to Quote is expected to improve advertising revenues in the home and local category.Moreover, accelerating consumer traffic across app and mobile is a positive for the company.  App unique devices grew 20% year over year to approximately 29 million on a monthly average basis in the December quarter. Significant improvement in cumulative reviews is also encouraging.However, increase in operating expenses driven by an expected increase in headcount, product development and sales & marketing expenses will remain an overhang on the bottom line. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

 (NASDAQ: NVDA) and  (NASDAQ: ADI) are as different as chalk and cheese. While NVIDIA has set the stock market on fire over the past few years thanks to the terrific demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), Analog Devices has struggled to get even close to the graphics specialist. data by  .However, Analog Devices' growth hasn't trailed NVIDIA's by that much, as evident from the chart. What's more, the company is targeting fast-growing markets such as automotive, industrial semiconductors, and consumer electronics to secure long-term growth, and it also  . But does this make it a better bet than the GPU titan? Let's find out.Image source: Getty Images.Analog Devices' growth has hit a higher gear in recent quarters after it completed the acquisition of Linear Technology in March of last year. The company's revenue shot up 54% year over year last quarter to $1.52 billion thanks to the acquisition. What's more, the current quarter's revenue guidance of $1.47 billion means that its top line could grow almost 22% year over year.Of course, the growth will normalize over the next few quarters as the year-over-year comparisons smooth out once the gains from the Linear Technology acquisition are absorbed. But at the same time, investors shouldn't forget that Analog Devices is now in a stronger position to tap into lucrative markets such as automotive and industrial to grow the business.Analog Devices claims that its total addressable market grew from $8 billion to $14 billion post-acquisition. For instance, the number of electric vehicles is expected to increase 10 times in the next five years, and this is expected to double the company's addressable market to $3 billion thanks to the growing demand for battery management systems (BMS) used in electric cars.Analog Devices got access to the BMS market after acquiring Linear, and it now expects to make a big dent. It is estimated that BMS sales will increase 20% a year going forward. Analog Devices is well-positioned to tap this market, as it  a 25-mile-plus increase in the driving range, over 10 years of battery life, and $500 worth of cost savings to the car maker.On the other hand, the growing deployment of sensors in industrial applications will be yet another catalyst for the company. For instance, factories are adding more than 500,000 collaborative robots (also known as cobots) annually on top of traditional robots, which will expand the market for Analog Devices' sensors and Ethernet and wireless connectivity chips by two times.In all, Analog Devices expects the factory automation market to create a $4 billion revenue opportunity by 2022. So, it can be concluded that Analog Devices is making moves in the right areas to power its growth in the long run.Unlike Analog Devices, the market has taken note of NVIDIA's searing financial growth as it is pursuing opportunities in fashionable areas such as video gaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The company's leadership in the discrete GPU market, where it holds a share of 66% according to Jon Peddie Research, has helped it expand its empire across several industries and has set it on its way to take advantage of fast-growing tech trends.For instance, NVIDIA's video gaming revenue increased 29% year over year last quarter, and it played a big part in the company's overall growth, as it accounts for almost 60% of total revenue. Looking ahead, demand for discrete GPUs will keep increasing thanks to the evolution of video gaming technology.As it turns out, 54% of PCs came with discrete graphics during the last quarter of 2017, an increase of 15.8% from the prior-year quarter. The reason why gamers are buying more discrete GPUs is that video games now need more powerful chips to run properly. For instance, AAA games developed with extremely high budgets carry rich graphics that cannot run on integrated graphics cards, and this is where NVIDIA's specialized GPUs come into play.Newzoo estimates that the global PC gaming market was worth $31 billion last year, and it could grow to almost $35 billion by the end of the decade. This indicates that demand for NVIDIA's GPUs will remain strong.But one of the major reasons NVIDIA's shares have simply taken off over the past few years is because of its interest in emerging tech trends such as artificial intelligence (AI). NVIDIA's GPUs are well-suited to  , as they are capable of carrying out millions of mathematical calculations simultaneously because they are equipped with thousands of cores.As such, NVIDIA has become the go-to provider of AI chips for companies ranging from  to  and  . Looking ahead, the AI chip market is expected to clock an annual growth rate of 50% through 2023, hitting over $11 billion in revenue and presenting yet another sizable opportunity for NVIDIA.NVIDIA and Analog Devices are going after lucrative markets to secure long-term growth. NVIDIA is the more popular pick based on Wall Street sentiment. But Analog Devices is cheaper than NVIDIA from a valuation perspective. data by  .Analog Devices is slightly cheaper than NVIDIA as far as the trailing  (P/E) ratio is concerned. But the gap widens on a forward earnings basis, making Analog Devices the way better pick. What's more, it carries a decent dividend yield of 2.13% as compared to NVIDIA's paltry payout of just 0.25%.Analog has raised its dividend 15 times in the last 14 years, so it has a strong dividend-paying history. As such, Analog Devices looks like the better bet for income-oriented investors. But for investors willing to pay up, NVIDIA could be the stock of choice, as it looks well-placed to sustain its terrific growth given the catalysts it has.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" 's  second-quarter fiscal 2018 results are scheduled to be released on May 1.The quarter witnessed investors' anxiety over lackluster sales of the premium iPhone X, leading to decline in sales estimates. Lack of demand compelled Apple to lower shipment target.iPhone, since its launch in 2007, has been the mainstay of the tech giant's revenues. In the first quarter, iPhone revenues increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $61.58 billion.However, lower-than-expected sales of iPhone X have prompted analysts to slash sales estimates for the product. Goldman Sachs, in its Mar 27 note, announced trimming of iPhone sales expectations by a whopping 1.7 million units to 53 million for the March quarter. Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities lowered his estimate for total iPhone shipments in the March quarter by 2 million units to 50 million units.Nonetheless, Apple's focus on ""aggressive pricing"" that resulted in a higher average selling price (ASP) from premium models - iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus - is likely to boost the top line, despite lower shipments. This is evident from the fact that expected growth of revenues from iPhone is way higher than growth of its shipments for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Notably, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPhone units sold is pegged at 52.94 million, up almost 4% from the actual figure reported in second-quarter 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iPhone and related products and services is $39.2 billion, up 18% from the actual figure in the year-ago quarter.However, the expensive price tag might prove an impediment in countries like China, which remains an important market for Apple, given the growing number of middle-class customers. Also, intensifying competition from regional players, who are offering feature-rich smartphones at a much cheaper price, remains a major headwind.Apple's iPad business has been sluggish for quite some time. However, with the launch of a low cost iPad in the second quarter of 2017, the company witnessed an uptick in iPad sales.Apple sold 13.2 million iPads in the first quarter, up 1% year over year, while revenues of $5.7 billion increased 6%.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iPad business is pegged at roughly $3.98 billion, up 2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPad units sold is around 9 million, up 1% year over year.However, Mac sales don't hold promise. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Mac is pegged at $5.71 billion, down 2.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total Mac units sold is 4.2 million, down 1% year over year.Apple's focus on developing innovative products in order to generate new revenue streams is a key growth driver. Fast growing Services and wearables (mainly Watch) segments are emerging as big growth catalysts.Notably, Apple's Other Product segment, which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats headphones, iPod touch and other accessories witnessed a 36% increase year over year in the last reported quarter, the highest among all its segments. In fact, the segment recorded a new all-time high with revenues of more than $5 billion for the first time in a quarter.Apple's Services segment, which includes revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, continues to grow rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, the Services segment had more than 240 million subscribers. Revenues surged 18% year over year to nearly $8.5 billion.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iTunes, Software and Services is $8.33 billion, up 18.3% year over year. | Apple beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 5.72%.The company's first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $3.89 per share and revenues of $88.29 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 and $86.29 billion, respectively.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $61.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 15.5%.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined by a penny to $2.69 over the last seven days.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: SOXX, NVDA, ADI, MCHP@2018-04-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-soxx-nvda-adi-mchp-2018-04-23

Also, uncertainty in cryptocurrency market remains a concern.However, HPC segment is expected to strengthen in the second quarter.Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 47-49% and operating margin is anticipated between 35% and 37%. This is based on the exchange rate assumption of $1= NT$ 29.20. Unfavorable product mix is expected to prevail in the second quarter and thus the management has lowered its guidance for gross margin.Additionally, tax rate is expected to lie in the range of 18-19% in the next quarter.For 2018, the company has raised its guidance for CapEx which is now anticipated to lie between $11.5 billion and $12 billion.We believe Taiwan Semi's strong focus toward innovation will continue to drive its top-line growth in the long run.Moreover, the company's increasing investments in research and development bodewell for the idea of product innovation and expansion.The company is also using EUV layers to make its 7 NM and N7 Plus more advanced to provide better density and greater power reduction. This is expected to enrich the company's portfolio and hence boost revenues.Further, the emerging trend of artificial intelligence and establishment of 5G networks are likely to bring in growth opportunities for the company as there will be an increase in the demand for semiconductors.Taiwan Semi carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology  , Analog Devices  and AMETEK  .

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 3.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADI due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Analog Devices reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. Although the bottom line surged 51.1% year over year, it declined 2.1% sequentially. However, the figure surpassed the guided range of $1.20-$1.36.Revenues of $1.52 billion topped the consensus mark of $1.50 billion and came close to the higher end of the guided range of $1.44-$1.54 billion. Moreover, the top line surged 54.3% year over year but declined 1.5% sequentially.The strong year-over-year growth was driven by a robust performance from industrial, automotive and communications end-markets.Industrial (49% of total revenues) revenues soared 87.4% year over year and 4% sequentially to $743.6 million.Communications (18.7% of total revenues) revenues surged 63% year over year and 4.1% sequentially to $284.3 million.Automotive (16.6% of total revenues) revenues jumped 76.4% from the year-ago quarter and 5.1% from the previous quarter to $252.2 million.Consumer (15.7% of total revenues) revenues declined 11.8% year over year and 23.8% sequentially to $238.5 million.Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 500 bps on a year-over-year basis and 20 bps sequentially to 71%.Adjusted operating expenses as percentage of revenues declined 180 bps from the year-ago quarter but increased 110 bps sequentially to 29.4%.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 670 bps on a year-over-year basis but contracted 90 bps sequentially to 41.7%.Analog Devices exited the first quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $827.6 million, down from $1.05 billion at the end of the prior quarter.Long-term debt was approximately $7.38 billion, down from $7.55 billion at the end of the previous quarter.Net cash provided by operations was $388.7 million, significantly down from $707.4 million reported in the preceding quarter.For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Analog Devices expects revenues between $1.43 billion and $1.51 billion.On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin in the range of 71-71.5%.

 (NASDAQ: ADI) hasn't  from investors over the past year despite a series of strong quarterly results, and it looks as if the company's latest report isn't going to change anything for the better. The chipmaker's fiscal first-quarter results topped Wall Street's estimates, the current quarter guidance was better than expected, and the dividend was hiked by 7%.Still, Analog shares fell for no apparent reason after the report was released, and the stock is already underperforming the market this year. data by However, investors looking further ahead than the next quarter might find the chipmaker an enticing bet, especially considering its strong dividend history and presence in fast-growing areas like industrial automation and the automotive sector. Let's see why Analog Devices could be a good bet for both income and growth.Analog's latest dividend hike marks its 15th increase in the past 14 years. The company will now pay a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, up from the prior payout of $0.45 a share. After this increase, Analog sports a forward dividend yield of 2.13%, substantially higher than the 1.27% industry average.Image source: Getty Images.More important, Analog Devices' payout ratio is in safe territory. The company had paid out 36% of its free cash flow in fiscal 2017 in the form of dividends. And Analog's free cash flow generation has been improving lately. Last quarter, the chipmaker's free cash flow increased close to 11% year over year. It should be able to boost this metric further thanks to robust bottom-line growth, which will eventually lead to a stronger dividend payout.Analog's net income increased 23.5% year over year on the back of a 54% jump in the top line during the latest quarter. The massive jump in the chipmaker's top and bottom lines was driven by the acquisition of Linear Technology, which was completed last year. This acquisition is crucial in expanding Analog Devices' addressable market across several verticals, paving the way for strong net income growth in the coming years. Let's see why.Analog Devices is targeting fast-growing niches in the semiconductor space. For instance, the automotive business could be one of the biggest growth drivers for the chipmaker thanks to a huge addressable opportunity.Analog currently gets 17% of its top line from automotive, with total revenue from this segment estimated at $900 million annually following the Linear Technology acquisition. But there's a lot of money to be made in the space as the semiconductor content in each vehicle is expected to grow to $600 in 2025 from $250 today, thanks mainly to the advent of autonomous driving, electric vehicles, and more electronic features inside each car.The electrification of cars is expected to boost Analog's addressable market by $1.5 billion over the next eight years, with self-driving vehicles creating an additional $3 billion opportunity. The company's legacy automotive business is growing in the high single digits, while the portion inherited after the Linear Technology acquisition is showing growth in the low single digits.However, the Linear side of the business is expected to record high-single-digit growth in the coming quarters as the synergies of the acquisition come into play. For instance, the combined company will now be in a better position with battery management systems (BMS) opportunity, which have been a sore spot for Analog.As it stands, Analog expects double-digit growth in BMS sales this year, which bodes well as this market could  20%. Investors, however, might question the company's valuation as it trades at an expensive 43 times last year's earnings, which is significantly higher than the 35.8 industry average.But investors need to take into account that Analog recorded a $691 million one-time charge related to the new tax law last quarter, otherwise its P/E ratio would have been lower. The stock trades at a much more reasonable 15.7 times forward earnings, indicating strong earnings growth going forward.Analog Devices seems like a good bet for investors looking for growth at a reasonable price. The company's business could substantially improve as it is targeting lucrative markets such as automotive. Investors should look past Analog's muted performance on the stock market, as it has bright long-term prospects, and will reward investors with a nice dividend as they wait for the rally to start.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

eighed down by the technology sector as a result of heavy losses in shares of Facebook (  ), Wall Street's major averages were trading sharply lower on Monday with the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite at its lowest level in 10 days.Risk aversion was magnified by the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting, a feeding frenzy in the shares Apple (  ) suppliers, as well as by geopolitical developments as tensions between the UK and Russia intensify, and as Italy struggles to break a post-election stalemate.Following the lead from Europe, US share prices fell at the open following reports that private user data on Facebook was used by a data analytics firm with ties to President Trump's 2016 campaign. Although Facebook maintains that it ordered Cambridge Analytica to destroy user data, the company never followed through, allowing for the unauthorized dissemination of personal information of millions of users and leaving the company vulnerable to litigation and regulatory scrutiny.Another tech heavyweight dragging down the Nasdaq is Apple after a Wall Street analyst warned that consumers may no longer tolerate the escalating price of an iPhone.

" (NASDAQ:  ) is facing a crossroads. With the merger with  (NASDAQ:  ) blocked and a pending return to the U.S., AVGO is left wondering where to go next. Moreover, as the company plans its next product releases and acquisition targets, investors should decide if the failed merger presents them with a buying opportunity in Broadcom stock.Broadcom had offered $117 billion for the company. In a  about Qualcomm, I described QCOM as falling into a lose-lose situation with the merger. Apparently, the Trump Administration decided the merger would become a loser for the country as well since it blocked the deal. Although the company is in the process of moving its headquarters back to the U.S., the government cited it as a ""foreign"" company as it is still based in Singapore.As our own  , Qualcomm supplies products to the Pentagon. The Far East ties imply links to China, which raises a national security concern. Aside from unknown geopolitical issues, Qualcomm's involvement in 5G could also play into the decision.My colleague  , pointing out CEO Hock Tan's reputation for cutting research and shoring up monopoly positions. Many fear such a move would favor China-based  In the 5G space. This could have forced the U.S. military, which prefers to work with American contractors, to buy Chinese equipment.Rumors that Broadcom will attempt the merger again after the move to the U.S. is complete have also emerged. In many respects, the company has remained American. Broadcom was founded in California. It moved overseas when  (hence the ""AVGO"" stock symbol) took it over in 2016. Also, throughout the time in Singapore, the company maintained operations in California. Still, if the government suspects Broadcom would hand the 5G equipment market to Huawei, I doubt this would occur.The question remains where the canceled deal leaves Broadcom and the tech sector in general. Broadcom confirmed that it still plans to move its headquarters back to the U.S. Singapore usually outranks the U.S. in ""  "" surveys. However, most regard the U.S., especially Silicon Valley, as the center of the tech world. Moreover, a U.S. base of operations makes mergers less exposed to the type of reviews that sunk the Qualcomm deal.Given the willingness to spend $117 billion to buy Qualcomm, most believe Broadcom will pursue other mergers.  such as  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Broadcom also acquired dozens of companies throughout its history before its purchase by Avago. Given past behavior, one should assume that these purchases should continue.Consequently, investors should also decide if Broadcom stock is good for them. AVGO stock increased in value after completion of the takeover by Avago. However, since the middle of last year, the stock has seen little movement. In fact, the stock has fallen about 5% since Broadcom announced the proposed merger on Nov. 6. Perhaps investors felt uncomfortable about AVGO, which has a $106 billion market cap, paying $117 billion to buy another company.Now, the pressure for Broadcom to acquire that level of funding remains off. Also, all the rumored targets come with much smaller price tags. And speaking of price tags, Broadcom stock trades at a reasonable valuation on a non-GAAP basis. The AVGO stock price today stands at about $260-per-share. With non-GAAP earnings of $16.02-per-share, the stock trades at only 16 times earnings. Analysts believe profit growth will stay in the high single-digits. Investors will have more information when AVGO reports quarterly earnings on March 15.Looking at the prospective product lines, merger targets and earnings of Broadcom stock, investors must decide if the failed merger presents an opportunity. To be sure, not having Qualcomm leaves AVGO without the benefits of many chip-related products. However, the failed merger also leaves Broadcom's balance sheet in a stronger position and leaves options open for other purchases in the future. With the low non-GAAP valuation, a failed merger by the company may mean the chance to buy AVGO stock with a stronger balance sheet and possibly a brighter future.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Why Broadcom Ltd Stock Is a Solid Buy Now@2018-03-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-broadcom-ltd-stock-solid-buy-now-2018-03-15
"I have to thank  (NASDAQ:  ). In August of last year, I discussed the contrarian opportunity in  (NASDAQ:  ). At the time, QCOM was under heavy pressure, but I maintained that the selloff was excessive. But out of nowhere, Broadcom's takeover bid for Qualcomm drove up sentiment for both Broadcom stock and its target.That being said, I wanted a responsible move higher for QCOM, not a slingshot like we witnessed.Furthermore, the bullish thesis almost exclusively centered on Broadcom's accusatory aggressiveness. Several analysts were pushing the argument. I even stated that the markets were suffering ""  ."" I have several reasons why I don't like gambling largely on a single news item, primarily that you never know what's going to happen next.When the new year rolled around, I still maintained that  on the takeover was risky, despite consensus saying otherwise. If it didn't happen, several, perhaps most investors would be disappointed and would proceed to sell out. The markets would punish QCOM, surely, but they'd also take Broadcom stock to task.Guess what? To loosely paraphrase President Trump, the best dealmaker in the history of deal-making stepped in and quashed the biggest deal in the history of the technology industry. In doing so, both AVGO and QCOM look ugly.I'm not here to rehash old news but rather to remind people what got us into this mess. Furthermore, it's always important to reconsider an investment whose catalyst is a high-variable merger. Again, you just don't know what will happen.We're now in the opposite situation compared to where we were late last year. We no longer have ""sure things."" Instead, we have open-ended questions about the company's trajectory. But could this be a fresh contrarian opportunity for Broadcom stock?Our own Will Healy listed out the potential ""bull case 2.0"" in his write-up a few days ago. While not sealing the QCOM deal hurts, Broadcom now has several options.Healy mentioned that management was  for Qualcomm. That leaves several strong companies on the table, including  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Essentially, investors can now purchase Broadcom stock with a stronger balance sheet and healthier prospects. I don't disagree with Healy's logic. At the same time, investors should consider why the Qualcomm deal cratered.President Trump ran on a populist message to win the White House, and he has largely maintained that position. According to  , Trump pulled the plug because the QCOM deal raised national security concerns. But just as importantly, he wasn't going to let a ""foreign-ish"" company with  take over an American stalwart.With the North Korea crisis, the Trump administration has few good options. The options that do exist the White House will take advantage of vigorously. With China being the critical factor in determining a peaceful outcome in North Korea, Trump has to show he means business.The President imposed severe tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a not-so-subtle dig at China. The quashed QCOM deal falls under the same category. Here's the message: rein in North Korea, don't mess with us, or else face the consequences.We can expect more tough actions, making Broadcom stock an unfavorable investment.If the QCOM deal was nixed due to typical competitive concerns, I'd give Broadcom stock another chance. But when you look at the broader geopolitical context, I'd rather consider less Trump-vulnerable options.Whatever you think about the President, we can all agree he wants things done his way or the highway. That kind of thinking buoyed the American working class and the organizations that hire them. However, when you're dealing with multinational affairs such as technology, things are more nuanced.I don't know President Trump personally, but I don't think nuance is his key strength.What I do know is that we're in unprecedented territory, which sparks substantial volatility. Given that so many analysts thought that Broadcom stock and QCOM were sure bets, I'm hesitant on pulling the trigger. Let the volatility ride out, wait for some stable price action, and then reconsider Broadcom.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Wait for Volatility to Subside Before Buying Broadcom Ltd Stock@2018-03-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wait-volatility-subside-buying-broadcom-ltd-stock-2018-03-21
"eading semiconductor company  recently announced an offering of senior unsecured notes aggregating $750 million. These notes have been issued in two tranches of different amounts with varying coupon rates and maturities.The first tranche of $300 million carries an interest rate of 2.850% and is due in 2020 while the second tranche of $450 million, which has an interest rate of 2.950%, is due in 2021.The company stated that the transaction proceeds will be used to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under its five-year term loan.Following the news, the company's share price was up 2.1%. However, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a 12-month basis. The company's shares have gained only 14.5% compared with the  's growth of 24.9%.At the end of fiscal first-quarter 2018, cash and short-term investments totaled $827.6 million, down from $1.05 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Long-term debt was approximately $7.38 billion, down from $7.55 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Net cash provided by operations was $388.7 million in the reported quarter.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it to capitalize on investment opportunities and pursue strategic acquisitions, further improving its growth prospects. The senior notes' offering will bring down the company's cost of capital, in our view, thus strengthening its balance sheet and supporting growth.Analog Devices'debt issue was assigned a Baa1 rating by a leading credit rating agency Moody's, along with a positive outlook.The rating has been assigned based on its optimism on Analog's sustained strong operating performance of the analog segment. The rating agency further believes that the acquisition of Linear Technology has further enhanced Analog's business profile. Moreover, it expects profitability to improve over the long term, driven by broad geographic, customer and end-market diversification. As a result, for fiscal 2018, Moody expects Analog to generate over $6 billion of revenues and $3 billion of EBITDA.Moody's assigned a positive outlook on the rating based on its belief that Analog will continue to reduce its debt in the near term and sustain operating performance. | Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are PetMed Express  , Teradyne  and Brady Corporation  .

eading semiconductor company  acquired a privately held company, Symeo GmbH, for an undisclosed amount.Based in Munich, Germany, Symeo GmbH develops and manufactures Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) hardware and software, used in automotive and industrial applications. The company's RF and sensor technology enables real-time position detection, distance measurement and telemetry.Following the acquisition, the Symeo team will join ADI's Autonomous Transportation and Safety (ATS) business unit.However, the stock has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a 12-month basis. The company's shares have gained 15.4% compared with the  's growth of 24.9%.Analog found the deal appealing because Symeo's signal processing algorithms offer high precision RADAR solutions. These solutions enable system integrators and original equipment manufacturers to work with great precision in rough industrial environments. The deal provides Analog's customers a RADAR platform with improvements in angular accuracy and resolution.Also, the acquisition will expand the company's share in the autonomous automotive segment. RADAR and cameras are sensor technologies that today's ADAS systems are increasingly using to provide advanced safety features like forward collision warning, pedestrian detection, blind spot detection and autonomous driving mode.In the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2018, the Industrial segment accounted for 49% of total revenues, which soared 87.4% year over year and 4% sequentially to $743.6 million. Also, Automotive accounted for 16.6% of total revenues and jumped 76.4% from the year-ago quarter and 5.1% from the previous quarter to $252.2 million.The deal will help the company gain a greater share in both the growing automotive and industrial markets.We see this acquisition as part of Analog Devices' ongoing investments in products for the industrial, automotive and aerospace markets.Management is making continuous collaborations with innovative brands to expand its RADAR offerings. Last year, the company collaborated with Renesas Electronics Corporation on a system-level 77/79-GHz RADAR sensor. The new sensor was designed especially for applications in the automotive space that are safer and more connected.We believe, the development of new technology along with a stronger foothold in Europe and China should benefit the company.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (Symbol: DGRO), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $38.67 per unit.With DGRO trading at a recent price near $33.48 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.51% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DGRO's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Matthews International Corp (Symbol: MATW), Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), and AAON, Inc. (Symbol: AAON). Although MATW has traded at a recent price of $50.20/share, the average analyst target is 83.27% higher at $92.00/share. Similarly, ADI has 17.26% upside from the recent share price of $88.41 if the average analyst target price of $103.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AAON to reach a target price of $40.00/share, which is 16.96% above the recent price of $34.20. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MATW, ADI, and AAON:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

"here is a lot of news in the financial world, but tariffs seem to top the list. While the Trump administration's new tariffs are all anyone can talk about right now, this is just the beginning of the story. It could end up being significant, or it could become trivial. We won't know for sure for at least several weeks, until we have a chance to see exactly what the president decides to do and how other countries react.Higher interest rates are also a popular topic for journalists. For several years now, we have heard that rates are going to go up. And they most certainly will... someday. But we don't know exactly when someday will be. What I do know is that it's unlikely that it will be an issue for stocks in the near term.
  
In theory, higher interest rates mean bonds will start paying out higher yields to bondholders, making them more attractive. Investors are likely to shift money from stocks to bonds when that happens. But at what point do bonds become more attractive than stocks?I don't think it will happen until rates are significantly higher.Currently, the interest rate on the 10-year Treasury is about 2.9%. I don't see investors rushing to bonds when that rate tops 3%... but at 5%? I mean, it's hard turning down a 5% yield from one of the safest investments out there. That's the level I'll be watching (although I believe the likelihood of that is relatively small for the next several years).And of course, the overvaluation of the stock market always seems to be a popular topic... as is every earnings miss and every bit of economic news.If you spend your day paying attention to the news, it can all become overwhelming at times. And while I follow the news (and try to keep you up to date on a variety of issues going on),  , which focuses on finding low-risk, high-income opportunities.But occasionally, the news can act in our favor... like when traders overreact to news and provide optimal opportunities for income-producing trades.This week, I'm recommending an income opportunity in  . It's a stock that fared better than most in the recent selloff, a bullish indicator for the short term.At the bottom of the chart is the stochastic oscillator, which is a popular measure of momentum. Bullish crossovers of the indicator tend to be followed by several weeks of rising prices in the stock.More importantly, the indicator held up under selling pressure last month. In the bottom section of the chart, you'll see two dark grey lines. The lower grey line represents the ""oversold"" level of the indicator. Oversold extremes are reached when prices drop sharply. Previous declines in ADI pushed stochastic oscillator below this level (marked by the blue and purple lines crossing below the lower grey line).But as you can see, the most recent price decline ended with the stochastic oscillator above that level. This indicates momentum traders used the selling as an opportunity to add to their positions. It also means that the likelihood of a significant decline in ADI is rather small.I've  . ADI manufactures analog, mixed-signal and digital-signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment. These technologies are used to convert, condition, and process real-world phenomena -- such as light, sound, temperature, motion and pressure -- into electrical signals. Its customers include Apple, Boeing and a number of other defense contractors, along with carmakers and chip manufacturers.Growth in the demand for chips has led to a strong uptrend in ADI that can be seen in the long-term chart below.The Internet of Things, driverless cars, and other new technologies should provide even more demand for ADI's chips, and that makes the company attractive for the long term.Both the company's management and market analysts agree with my assessment. ADI released Q1 earnings at the end of February, in the midst of the market selloff. Analog Devices reported earnings per share (  ) of $1.42 and sales of $1.52 billion -- exceeding analysts' expectations for EPS of $1.29 and sales of $1.50 billion. Despite a strong report, the downtrend in the market pushed the stock lower.For the current quarter, Analog Devices expects to earn $1.37 a share on sales of $1.47 billion based on the midpoint of its guidance. This is also above analyst expectations, which are for EPS of $1.24 and sales of $1.45 billion for this quarter.After the news was released, at least seven analysts raised their price targets for ADI.B. Riley FBR was the most bullish, raising its price target to $122 from $113, and noting in its report that the company should benefit from such tailwinds including 5G wireless infrastructure, Internet of Things, advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving cars.While the long term does look promising, I am focusing on the short run with an option that expires in less than two months.If you're interested in catching some of the potential upside, you can always buy shares of ADI and wait for further positive earnings surprises... if they happen.But I found a better trade... I plan on trading ADI a fourth time -- and guarantee that I will collect 3.1% in income in just a little over a month. That's a more-than-comfortable 26.7% annualized. And all without buying a single share of the stock. This trade uses a high-income, short-term put option on ADI.Now, I understand not everyone is comfortable selling options, but you shouldn't let that keep you from taking advantage of this tool.

For the iShares U.S. Dividend and Buyback ETF (Symbol: DIVB), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $29.17 per unit.With DIVB trading at a recent price near $26.10 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.74% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DIVB's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Express Scripts Holding Co (Symbol: ESRX), Kroger Co (Symbol: KR), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although ESRX has traded at a recent price of $73.42/share, the average analyst target is 12.52% higher at $82.61/share. Similarly, KR has 12.35% upside from the recent share price of $26.23 if the average analyst target price of $29.47/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $103.67/share, which is 11.78% above the recent price of $92.74. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ESRX, KR, and ADI:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Predict 12% Gains Ahead For DIVB@2018-03-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-predict-12-gains-ahead-divb-2018-03-08

"In this week's video I discuss two companies that recently reported better than expected earnings results, and that have continued upside going into the next quarter. They are Analog Devices (ADI), and Dine Brands Global (DIN). is a world leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of a broad portfolio of high performance analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs) used in virtually all types of electronic equipment. Since their inception in 1965, they have focused on solving the engineering challenges associated with signal processing in electronic equipment. Used by over 100,000 customers worldwide, their signal processing products play a fundamental role in converting, conditioning, and processing real-world phenomena such as temperature, pressure, sound, light, speed, and motion into electrical signals to be used in a wide array of electronic devices.ADI announced earnings on February 28 th , where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates for the 14 th consecutive quarter. On a year over year basis, the company posted +51.1% earnings growth and +54.4% revenue growth. During the quarter the company saw continued strong demand for analog semiconductors which helped all segments post revenues above expectations. Further, the Linear Technology acquisition in March of 2017 has helped reduce overall costs, and aided the bottom line results during the quarter.Due to the continued success in the semiconductor sector, and the strong outlook for the sector going forward, management gave better than expected guidance for Q2 18; they now expect revenues to come in between $1.43-1.51 billion, above the previous expectation of $1.43 billion, and EPS to be between $1.30-1.44, ahead of the previous expectation of $1.24.To add to the impressive earnings report, the Board of Directors approved a +7% increase in its quarterly dividend bringing the quarterly payment to $0.48, or $1.92 on an annual basis for an annual dividend yield of +2.1%.These positive announcements caused B. Riley FBR Inc. to raise its target price from $113 to $122.As you can see in the Price and Earnings Consensus graph below, ADI has been on an upwards trend since the beginning of 2016. | Due to the earnings report being so recent, there have not been any analysts estimate revisions, but this should change over the next several days. previously known as  , was created from a foundation established by IHOP - an American icon to their guests and a franchising company focused on providing strategic, visionary leadership for their franchisees, unparalleled opportunities for our team members, and enhancing value for their shareholders. By bringing Applebee's together with IHOP, they made a bold, new commitment to their brand-revitalization abilities and to the power of franchising. DineEquity has successfully made their two businesses more powerful and more successful than either brand could have been apart.Dine Brands Global also recently reported earnings where they beat both top and bottom line expectations. The big take away from the report was the improved success in the Applebee's segment which was due to its value offerings, and advertising strategies that have progressed faster than expected. This operational execution turnaround saw comparable same restaurant sales improve by +1.3%, and caused management to increase FY 18 comp sales expectations (flat to +3.0%). The success of Applebee's is also expected to improve royalty collections in 2018.Further, the long term outlook has significantly improved under new CEO Steve Joyce who has a solid track record of operating multi-brand companies, and franchise models. He and his management team introduced a 5 year plan which includes; sustaining positive comparable same restaurant sales, unit growth domestically for the IHOP franchise (expected to open between 85-100 restaurants in 2018), cost management measures, dividend payments with a 35-45% payout ratio of adjusted free cash flows, and new acquisitions.The earnings report and future goals set by management caused the stock price to jump up by over +16%. The graph below shows the huge improvement in the stock price and future earnings estimates. | To add to the positive news, the company also pays a big +5.1% annual dividend yield. So we have a solid turnaround story, with a very nice dividend.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Moreover, ongoing investments are likely to strengthen product portfolio as well as competitive position, which will boost the top line.We believe that top-line growth is likely to be driven by Analog Devices' diversified product portfolio and expanding customer base. Moreover, higher contribution from Linear Technology acquisition remains a tailwind.Further, Analog Devices is likely to benefit from increasing demand for autonomous driving solutions. Additionally, continuing demand for high value signal processing & power management applications, software-defined radio solutions and portable applications are anticipated to drive the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial, Automotive, Communication and Consumer segment revenues are currently pegged at $704 million, $231 million, $272 million and $234 million, respectively.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

The figure was also better than 5 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Strong growth can primarily be attributed to 34.3% jump in revenues, which totaled $555.4 million.

The robust top-line performance was driven by solid growth in subscription and professional revenues.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Workday expects revenues in the range of $538-$540 million.

 .  is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 26. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this cybersecurity company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.5%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 79 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 25.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $524.4 million, up 24.3% from the year-ago quarter.Let's take a look at the driving factors this quarter.Palo Alto is growing rapidly in the cybersecurity space on the back of its innovative next-generation security platforms. The company's security platforms have innovative traffic classification engine which helps it identify network traffic by application, user and content. As a result, organizations have in-depth visibility into all traffic and applications, helping the firms control usage, content, risks and cyber threats at the user level.Therefore, Palo Alto's security platforms simplify security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone security appliances and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership, in turn, giving a competitive edge to the organization.Furthermore, over the last two years, the company has launched several subscription-based products, including WildFire, AutoFocus, Aperture, Traps and Virtual, which have been witnessing strong adoption among organizations.The company's innovative product portfolio and continued efforts to enhance the same with advanced features helps Palo Alto win new deals. Notably, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company added more than 2,500 customers, bringing the total to more than 45,000 worldwide. It should be noted that in each of the last 23 quarters, Palo Alto has added at least 1,000 customers.The company's to-be-reported quarterly result is likely to add a sizable number of new customers, which, in turn, will drive Palo Alto's top line.Furthermore, acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of Palo Alto to enhance its product portfolio as well as expand the company's global reach. Last year, the company acquired LightCyber for $105 million, which expanded its Next-Generation Security Platform. Over the past few years, the company has completed three important buyouts - Morta Security, Cyvera and CirroSecure.Analysts covering the stock believe the diversity of its products and increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers. This will again bolster its top line, the benefit of which will trickle down to the bottom line.Additionally, the company is keen on expanding its cloud exposure through partnerships. It has existing cloud partnerships with companies like Amazon's  Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's  Google Cloud. In August 2017, the company expanded ties with VMware, Inc. Through the new collaboration, Palo Alto will combine its security platform with VMware's software platform, which provides private cloud-based service to make the cloud-computing environment more secure, simple, flexible, and efficient.This deal will better equip organizations to handle private cloud technology and control business applications securely. As VMware remains one of the leading companies in the virtualization and cloud computing space, Palo Alto is likely to gain significantly from this alliance and we might witness a glimpse of the same in the quarter under review. | Our proven model conclusively shows that Palo Alto Networks is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .

This feature will allow tenants to pay rents or submit other requests using voice commands through AppFolio's platform. We believe the company's collaboration with Amazon along with the expansion of its offerings will boost the top line going forward.Notably, the company upgraded its product suite during the third quarter with enhancements including the likes of AppFolio Renters Insurance, a new Value+ Service, and same day ACH, an addition to the existing Electronic Payments Value+ Platform.These advancements are anticipated to increase the customer base of the company, which comprised 11,258 property managers and around 9,000 legal customers at the end of the third quarter.However, intensifying competition in the cloud based business software solutions space remains a concern.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

 (NASDAQ: ADI) has failed to stoke investor enthusiasm despite  over the past year. The chipmaker has witnessed broad-based growth across its entire business in recent quarters, thanks to the Linear Technology acquisition a year ago. Still, the market has failed to reward the company's consistent performances. The stock is up just 8% over the past year. data by The chipmaker is set to report Q1 2018 results on Feb. 28. Here's what to expect.Image Source: Getty Images.Usually, the first quarter of Analog's fiscal year (November-January) is a slow one. But the company is confident that it will beat the seasonal trend thanks to improving traction in the industrial market and an extra week in this quarter.The midpoint of Analog's first-quarter guidance puts the top line at $1.49 billion, a 52% increase from the year-ago period. This massive increase in the company's revenue is expected to lift its earnings to $1.29 per share, as compared to $0.94 per share in the year-ago period.The expected strong growth in Analog Devices' top and bottom lines is being driven by the acquisition of Linear Technology, which was completed in March 2017. This has been a big catalyst for the chipmaker, bolstering its position in lucrative markets such as industrial and automotive.The acquisition has catapulted Analog's addressable market in the automotive space to $3 billion. Analog and Linear's combined annual automotive revenue stood at $900 million in 2016. More important, Analog's automotive revenue shot up 45% last fiscal year, and the rapid growth will continue in the coming quarters as the semiconductor content in cars continues to increase.Analog recently announced that it plans to consolidate some of the wafer manufacturing and testing facilities that came with Linear Technology. The company will close a wafer fabrication facility in California and a test facility in Singapore. The consolidation will result in a charge of $55 million to $65 million during the first quarter, affecting its  earnings per share, but it will eventually result in $100 million worth of cost synergies, according to the company.Analog's earnings going forward should get a boost as the transition starts gaining traction, and I'm looking for strong top- and bottom-line guidance when the company reports Feb. 28.The consumer business, for example, grew an impressive 52% year over year in fiscal 2017, as Analog's business at smartphone giant  saw a remarkable increase. Analog supplies the technology to enable the 3D Touch feature in iPhones, and the OLED-based iPhone X carries a  of this.Analog's industrial business, meanwhile, is another big beneficiary of the Linear Technology acquisition, jumping 58% last fiscal year. This segment accounts for 46% of Analog's total revenue, and it is going from strength to strength thanks to the company's strategy of targeting fast-growing industrial niches like factory automation.Analog Devices has a lot going for it, which should allow it to deliver an investor-pleasing fourth-quarter report.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 22. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this IT solution-providing company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last two quarters. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The acquisition of EMC Corporation (stylized as EMC) by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With this acquisition, Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data-storage market. EMC offers data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.Additionally, VMware  was EMC's subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company. Therefore, the acquisition of EMC, along with its privately-controlled structure, will provide Dell an unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to deepen its relationships with customers of all sizes.Apart from this, it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment. Notably, according to IDC, during third-quarter 2017, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market-share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, chiefly benefiting from ""the strong synergy between its server team and the storage team incorporated from the EMC acquisition"".This happened mainly because Hewlett Packard Enterprise is now focusing on enterprise market and ""pivoting away"" from the firm's hyperscaler business, which has been denting its short-term revenues. We believe this strategy will hurt Hewlett Packard Enterprise's to-be-reported quarter's revenues.Since its split from HP Inc.  , Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been focusing on restructuring and realigning the company's businesses to drive long-term sustainable growth and improvise margins. In doing so, the company has spun-off its Software and Enterprise Services business. The spin-offs will surely result in an unfavorable year-over-year comparison, which means disappointing top- as well bottom-line results for the fiscal first quarter.Moreover, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, in its previous earnings conference calls, had hinted that the company might continue to shrink with spin-offs. However, in our opinion, the company's contrarian strategy might be in the right direction but the turnaround is still far behind as we haven't seen any significant improvement in the recently-reported financial results. We also consider that the company is still struggling to determine its true business focus.Also, we consider that the company's to-be-reported quarterly results will bear the brunt of the three main challenges it is currently facing - competitive pricing, heightened commodities pricing pressure and some dilution from M&A. These headwinds are expected to thwart its overall performance in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Hewlett Packard Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.8), with the stock changing hands as low as $89.62 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, ADI makes up 4.36% of the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH) which is trading lower by about 1.8% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices (ADI) Shares Cross 2% Yield Mark@2018-02-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-adi-shares-cross-2-yield-mark-2018-02-02

The solutions are in demand owing to the rising complexity in product design and wide scale adoption by major manufacturing companies.Moreover, collaborations with major CAD vendors - Autodesk, PTC and Siemens as well as companies like NVIDIA, Ferrari, Taiwan Semiconductor, Synopsys and Grundfos are expanding product portfolio. These have helped the company offer varied range of products ranging from automotive reliability solutions, live simulation software, and high performance steering wheels.Moreover, these partnerships have strengthened the company's competitive position in the simulations market.ANSYS expects the transition from perpetual license contracts to longer term, time-based licenses at some of the company's largest customers (in mature markets like the United States and Japan) to affect software license and maintenance revenues growth in the near term.Further, ANSYS expects to incur additional charges of $2 million ($1.3 million, net of tax), primarily in the quarter, related to additional realignment charges.

" is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Sep 30, 2018) results, after the closing bell on Jan 31.The company's bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters. Earnings met the consensus estimate in the remaining two, resulting in an average beat of 6.31%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Qualcomm operates in a highly competitive global mobile semiconductor market with incumbents like Broadcom Inc.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and Intel Corp.  . Stiff competition in the wireless baseband chipset market has forced the largest mobile chipset manufacturer in diversifying into the lucrative IoT market.In August 2017, Qualcomm announced the acquisition of Scyfer B.V., a company affiliated with the University of Amsterdam and which focuses on cutting-edge machine learning techniques. It specializes in building Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for companies worldwide and in a number of different industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare and finance. The acquisition of Scyfer will aid Qualcomm to advance its AI research and development.In July 2017, the company made available the Qualcomm Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine software development kit for developers from multiple industries-mobile, automotive, healthcare, security and imaging-to acquire tools for delivering on-device neural network-driven user experiences. With such booming prospects and strategic ideas, Qualcomm visualizes a world where AI would make devices, machines, automobiles and make things more intelligent, simplifying and enriching people's daily lives.2017 has been a mixed year for Qualcomm. The company has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with, multiple technological achievements and launches. Management has taken significant steps to reduce cost by $1 billion per annum.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Qualcomm's shares have gained 26.42%, outpacing the  's growth of 16.05% over the past three months.On the other hand, Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market may hurt Qualcomm's profits in the future. The company is facing severe competitive threat from its closest rival, Intel, which has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. Intel started delivering multi-mode LTE baseband modem. Competition is also likely to emanate from formidable rivals like Broadcom and Nvidia.Broadcom already introduced its LTE baseband chipset in the market, while Nvidia launched Tegra 4i, its LTE-integrated application processor. Also, opposition emanates from low-cost chip suppliers like Mediatek of Taiwan, VIA Technologies of China and Spreadtrum Communications. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next 4-5 years, a major part of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may exert pressure on Qualcomm's margins.The $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments, filed by tech giant Apple Inc. (in January 2017) against Qualcomm with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, is getting uglier day by day. Since January 2017, there had been a number of counter attacks from either side. Initially, Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.Meanwhile, Apple has garnered the support of Silicon Valley biggies and its suppliers in its nasty legal spat with Qualcomm. Apple's suppliers have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of ""violating"" the U.S Antitrust Law. They have claimed that Qualcomm continues to extract additional licensing money over assembling of iPhones. With so many twists and turns, we remain eager to see how this dispute actually pans out in the coming days.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Verizon is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.

 recently signed a memorandum of understanding with four leading Chinese handset developers, namely, Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology, Ltd., Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp., Ltd., vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd. and Xiaomi Communications Co., Ltd., for a multi-year sale of RF Front-End solutions. The value of the deal is more than $2 billion. Notably, China is the most important market for Qualcomm after the United States.However, the company also received a bad news. The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, has slapped a fine of €997 million (approximately $1.24 billion) on Qualcomm over anticompetitive practices related to mobile chipset sale. The EC claims that an iPhone/iPad modem exclusivity deal between Qualcomm and Apple Inc.  , which lasted from 2011 to the end of 2016, amounted to anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm abused its dominant market position for 4G LTE chipset and payed significantly to Apple to secure modem exclusivity.Only a week ago, in a major relief to Qualcomm, the EC gave its nod to the company for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV  with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission also gave its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.The major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market for smartphones and tablets. NXP, on the other hand, manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.On Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm's board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy, as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom's paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.Moreover, the EC's decision to fine Qualcomm $1.24 billion on charges that it offered discounts in exchange for chip purchase commitments will also raise questions on its business practices. The EC's ruling comes 13 months after South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $853 million for alleged antitrust violations. The largest mobile chipset maker is also facing $1 billion lawsuit from Apple in the United States related to royalty and rebate payments.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

imilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in ADTN.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 94 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 30 cents.Also, for the current quarter, ADTRAN has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to a loss of 17 cents a share from earnings of 16 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 28.1% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer and Technology sector, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Analog Devices, Inc.  .

"Technology stocks had a prolific run in 2017, courtesy of the rapid adoption of cloud-based platforms, increasing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and significant progress in developing advanced driver assisted system (ADAS) solutions. Source: ShutterstockMoreover, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices became part of the mainstream technology market driven by significant investments from tech bigwigs - Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook.Further, Internet of Things (IoT) technology made rapid strides in 2017. Consumer as well as industrial products and machines were embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.According to latest  , technology sector's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to improve 14% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues.Semiconductors are primarily gaining from strong demand for power-efficient and high-performance chips. These are essential to run cloud-data centers and process massive data by using IoT analytics, machine learning and deep learning applications.Moreover, the rapidly expanding IoT market is driving growth for chip components to power applications, particularly ADAS, medical/healthcare and smart devices. Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has evolved as another catalyst for semiconductor providers.We believe that these emerging trends have provided much needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to offset loss of business due to the shrinking PC market which still consumes bulk of chips.According to Gartner's latest data, PC shipments in the quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The downside marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.However, IDC's data contradicted Gartner's figures due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. According to IDC, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm's previous prediction of a fall of 1.7%.2017 witnessed a plethora of cyber attacks. Two back-to-back ransomware attacks were reported - WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June - followed by the massive data breach at Equifax in September.In addition to these, the data theft and ransom paid by Uber disclosed in November fueled the bullish momentum of the stocks in this space. Notable companies like Mondelez, FedEx, Merck & Co. suffered from cyber attacks during the year, which may have a material impact on their financial performances.The frequency and severity of attacks have exposed the loopholes of the security systems deployed by enterprises worldwide. Further, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.These factors increased demand for advanced cyber security solutions that drove stock prices of cyber security companies in 2017.With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right technology stocks that have the potential to beat earnings can be a daunting task. However, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for investors.You can narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,  and  . division Google recently signed a patent licensing deal with Tencent Holdings Ltd in an attempt to find ways to grow in China, the second largest economy, where many of its products have been discontinued.The cross licensing deal with Chinese social media and gaming firm, Tencent will allow the companies to come together and create new technologies. Though Google hasn't disclosed the scope and financial terms of the patent deal but it covers a wide range of products.Google has entered into similar agreements before with companies like Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and Cisco Systems. However, this is the first time that it has collaborated with a large Chinese technology firm. According to Google, such agreements reduce the possibility of litigation on patent infringement.Google's head of patents, Mike Lee said, ""By working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users.""Notably, shares of Alphabet have gained 37.1% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 26.8% rally of the  it belongs to.Despite a strict Chinese policy that imposes restrictions on foreign firms, including censorship, the search giant has been trying to rebuild its presence in the market.Google has undertaken many initiatives like sharing its artificial intelligence software, investing in local projects like AI research lab and introducing a version of its translation app to get back to business with China.We believe Tencent will turn out to be a key ally for Google as it operates China's widely used social media and payments app, WeChat and its most famous app store. Tencent is also quite famous for hosting the largest gaming and livestream platforms in the country. With Tencent's push, the tech giant can make its way into China.Google has had a bad history with China. Since 2010, Google's search engine has been banned in the Chinese market along with its app store, email and cloud storage services. The company is losing a lot of revenues because of these restrictions.When Google exited China back in 2010, the company had 36% share of search advertising and online ad spending was $3.7 billion. During that period, the company used to generate roughly $300 million every year from China. Since its exit, total ad spending in China has skyrocketed. Last year, ad spending in China was $84.4 billion, according to WPP's GroupM.Owing to the ban on Google Play, the company is missing out on potential revenues too. According to App Annie, Chinese consumer spending on applications is ballooning up. People spent nearly $35 billion on apps in 2017 and this aggressive growth is expected to continue in the upcoming years.Clearly, Google doesn't want to miss out this opportunity. The Information reported that the company has plans to introduce a censored version of Play Store in China by partnering with a Chinese company, Netease. This shows how keen the search giant is to get back to China.Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are SMART Global Holdings, Inc., Analog Devices, Inc. and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Watts Water has also outperformed the  's rally of 19.3% during the same time frame.We believe this is the right time to add the stock as the company has solid prospects and is poised to maintain this bullish momentum in the near term.Here are five reasons to pick this water safety and flow control-products maker. Watts Water currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a favorable  of A.

Watts Water has an impressive earnings surprise history. It outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 3.7%. Volume growth, along with the continued execution of productivity and key strategic initiatives, including the company's transformation and restructuring actions, will boost margin performance.

It also remains focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each manufacturing facility.Watts Water has completed 21 acquisitions in the last 10 years. Its acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that promote key macro themes around safety & regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation.In November 2016, the company acquired PVI Riverside Holdings, Inc. - a leading manufacturer of commercial stainless steel water-heating equipment. Further in December, Watts Water completed the acquisition of AERCO, a leading manufacturer of a wide range of high-efficiency commercial boilers and water heaters. These buyouts have enabled the company to expand its product breadth to the fast-growing markets for high efficiency boilers and hot-water heaters.Some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector include Analog Devices, Inc.  and Broadcom Limited  , both flaunting a Zacks Rank #1, and AMETEK, Inc.  carrying a Zacks Rank #2.Analog Devices has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.4%.

Among the largest underlying components of IWP, in trading today Zoetis Inc (Symbol: ZTS) is up about 0.1%, Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is off about 0.4%, and Ross Stores, Inc. (Symbol: ROST) is higher by about 1.2%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of IWP, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IWP's low point in its 52 week range is $99.20 per share, with $127.22 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $127.22. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Outflow Detected - IWP, ZTS, ADI, ROST@2018-01-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-outflow-detected-iwp-zts-adi-rost-2018-01-19
" is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 24.TE Connectivity has an excellent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.7% in the trailing four quarters. The company recorded its eight consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, surpassing estimates by 7.8%. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to report strong revenues in Transportation Solutions business, which constitutes more than half of its total revenues.We expect TE Connectivity to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model shows that TE Connectivity has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below: TE Connectivity has an Earnings ESP of +0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.TE Connectivity is now poised to grow on the back of strong demand in end markets, along with its overarching business model and continued progress on strategic priorities. The company's Commercial transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress, driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for its transportation business. Additionally, the sensor business is anticipated to see strong design win momentum, fueled by the growth of automotive space, which is likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Transportation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $1,867 million compared with fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $1,844 million. However, revenues from Industrial Solutions segment are anticipated to be low sequentially, with an estimate of $869 million compared with reported revenues of $954 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, being a market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, the company is armed with a comprehensive portfolio that supplements its strength. About 80% of the company's revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. Over the past five years, its harsh business applications have experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth. Going forward, we believe that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion.This apart, the company's ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to core business, going forward. The company's buyout of MicroGroup and agreement to acquire Hirschmann Car Communication enhanced its harsh environment portfolio and are expected to drive first-quarter fiscal sales as well.However, primarily dependent on end market dynamics the company's business is subject to cyclical risks that the end markets suffer. Though the company has witnessed some stability in direct business with OEMs, poor sales through distribution channels are taking longer-than-expected recovery time, consequently hurting segmental performance. Additionally, the company's weakness in commercial transportation market due to weak global construction and agriculture markets, along with weakness in the North America heavy truck markets, have been adding to woesFurther, sluggishness in oil and gas markets and its derivative impact on other industrial markets will likely act as strong headwinds for the company. Also, helicopter demand has also been impacted adversely, which can prove to be a drag on the company's aerospace business. This apart, the company believes the supply chain inefficiencies can prove to be a drag on the earnings in the quarter under review.Here are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see AMTEK, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.12% and a Zacks Rank #2.Harris Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options become available this week, for the September 21st expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new September 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $88.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $96.29/share today.Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.74% return on the cash commitment, or 10.25% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $95.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $97.50 strike price has a current bid of $6.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $96.29/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $97.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.59% if the stock gets called away at the September 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $97.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $97.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

 reported earnings (excluding stock based compensation and all one-time items) of 82 cents per share for the fourth-quarter of 2017, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents but remained flat year over year.Revenues increased 7.2% year over year and 5.3% sequentially to $237.6 million, primarily driven by strong adoption of the company's 25 gigabit per second and above Ethernet switch business. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $235 million. Additionally, increased adoption and enhanced performance of Mellanox's products aided the top-line.Moreover, adoption of 100 Gigabit EDR solutions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, database and storage contributed toward revenue growth. Also, InfiBand's adoption aided Mellanox to continue its leadership position in the high-performance interconnects space.We note that shares of Mellanox have gained 50.6% in the last year, outperforming the Zacks  rally of 33%.In fourth-quarter 2017, InfiniBand revenues were $102 million, which increased 1.9% sequentially driven by growth from the company's high-performance computing and artificial intelligent customers. InfiniBand-based products contributed 43% of total revenues during the quarter, Mellanox was selected by a tier 1 U.S. (Original Equipment Manufacturer) OEM in order to supply 25 gigabit per second Ethernet adapters. Users are selecting Mellanox due to the robustness and feature advantages of its ConnectX solutions over its peers' products.Ethernet revenues grew 73% on a year-over-year basis and sequentially 11%, driven by significant increase in customer demand for the company's 2550 and 100 gigabit per second Ethernet Solutions.The transition to 25 gigabit, 50 gigabit and 100 gigabit Ethernet will help Mellanox to post multi-year growth across various sectors such as cloud, storage, hyperscale and machine learning.However, management decided to discontinue its 1550 nanometer silicon photonics development activities as the business did not generate profits. Moreover it believes that this decision will not have an impact on the company's revenues going forward.The company started shipping BlueField chips during the quarter, resulting from EZchip acquisition, which has been experiencing increased market traction.Non-GAAP gross margin was 68.8%, which declined 310 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to lower margin product.Non-GAAP operating expenses during the quarter came in at $125.4 million, up 9% year over year.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 23.Last quarter, the company's adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 1.7%. Overall, Waters Corp. outpaced estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Waters Corp.'s key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Particularly, Global pharmaceuticals business, which is the company's largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division in the past few quarters. We believe stable demand from pharmaceutical business, modest recovery of industrial markets as well as growth in recurring revenues will benefit the fourth-quarter results.Moreover, the company remains bullish on its Industrial business backed by increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications. Additionally, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company's mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive for its business and is likely to bolster the fourth-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, the company benefited largely from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. The company's liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System, while mass spectrometry grew impressively, driven by ACQUITY QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust traction of ACQUITY and CORTECS line of products along with strength in end markets are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.However, the fact remains that rising R&D expenses and high interest expenses remain a burden, consequently eroding profitability for the upcoming results. A significant portion of the company's revenues is generated from non-U.S. markets. This makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. We believe currency fluctuations to put pressure on top-line growth and margins for the quarter under review.Further, the company grapples with stiff competition from several international instrument manufacturers as well as other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. The company's key technologies like HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines are part of a highly competitive industry and are subject to rapid changes in technology.Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Waters Corp. this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below. : Waters Corp. has an Earnings ESP of -0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  : The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP.

n a major relief to Qualcomm Inc.  , the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, gave its nod for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV  with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission has also given its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter's acquisition. Per the deal, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The regulator had conducted an in-depth probe to see if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.Qualcomm agreed to grant rivals licenses to NXP's transport fare collection technology for eight years. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) and secure element patents except for defensive purposes as well as for its own baseband chipset. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable smartphones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.Qualcomm has told the EC that it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents as well as some nonessential patents for near-field communications services, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer. These third-party buyers would be obliged for three years to grant others royalty-free licenses to use those patents. Qualcomm will acquire a few of NXP's other nonstandard essential NFC patents though it would also be obliged to grant royalty-free licenses to others for use of those patents.The major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company's business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.On Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm's board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom's paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.NXP is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners.The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction's closure.Qualcomm's shares have gained 31.9%, outperforming the  's growth of 13.6% over the past 90 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Here's another stock idea to consider.

 is going great guns with global expansion of its media services. Recently, the company announced that it'll begin pushing Amazon Music service to Australia and New Zealand from Feb 1. The new subscribers will get a 90-day free trial and it will be available on all widely used platforms. The service will be later charged $5 a month.Also, Amazon announced that it has started accepting pre-orders in Australia for Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Plus devices for $149 AUD, $220 AUD and $79 AUD, respectively. To attract customers, the company has also discounted all three devices by $30 AUD for a limited period. The shipment of these devices will begin early next month.The smart speakers will come with a regional version of Alexa, featuring Australian and New Zealand accent. This along with local knowledge offerings and skills were created by developers in the region.Notably, shares of Amazon have gained 60.3% in the past 12 months, substantially outperforming the 23.7% rally of the S&P 500.Apparently, Amazon has been putting in a lot of effort to search for new markets for its Alexa powered devices and its services like Music and Prime. The rate at which the company is penetrating new markets makes us optimistic. In December, the company had announced that it's expanding in 28 new countries.This growing presence will help Amazon maintain its dominance in the smart speakers market. It already holds almost 70% share in the market, per eMarketer.Amazon Alexa powered Echo devices have been one its best performing products so far, evident from their performance in the holiday season. Per the company's statement, Echo Dot was the top-selling product on Amazon.com during the holiday season. Also, Per TechCrunch, which quoted Voicebot, it is estimated that Amazon sold more than 20 million Alexa devices and 1 million non-Echo smart speakers with Alexa built-in through the third quarter of 2017.These devices support Amazon's bottom line even after sale by complementing Amazon's other services. Per Cowen & Co. consumer tracking survey, 84% of the Echo users in the United States use it for listening to music. Expanding in new countries will help in increasing its Music Unlimited user base. Consequently, its recurring revenue base will improve.Moreover, we believe that the expansion will not only help Amazon to sell products in these countries but also help it to get a lot of user data that it can utilize to provide more customer-oriented services in these countries. This will bode well for the company's top line in the long haul.Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited  , Analog Devices, Inc.  and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"If you're feeling a little queasy after the market's late-day plunge, you're not alone. The major indices were poised for another strong session to start the week; in fact, the Dow crossed above 26,000 for a time. Then the bottom dropped out in one of the sharpest single-day reversals in recent years.The NASDAQ saw the sharpest slide of the Big 3 with a slump of 0.51% to 7223.7, while the S&P was off 0.35% to 2776.4. The Dow almost moved back into positive territory before the closing bell, but finished with a slight loss of 0.04% to 25,792.9. The Russell 2000, which had been making new highs along with its larger counterparts of late, plunged 1.19% to 1573.Today's drop marks only the second down day for the three major indices in 2018. While fears over a possible government shutdown is a popular reason for today's pullback, the bottom line is that this market has been running hot for a while and could probably benefit from a cooling off period.

 is looking to offer $400 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes in a private placement. The notes are slated to mature in 2023. The notes will be offered to institutional buyers qualifying under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The offering is subject to certain market conditions.Notably, the company is looking to grant preliminary buyers the privilege of buying another $60 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes within a period of 13 days (from and including) of the date of first issuance of the notes.These notes, once placed, will be an unsecured senior liability of Nutanix, interest for which will be paid in arrears semi-annually. The notes can be converted to into cash and shares of Nutanix's Class A common stock or a combination of cash and common shares of Nutanix at the discretion of the owners of the notes and the company.The terms related to interest rate and initial conversion rate will be determined following the pricing of the offer. Nutanix intends to use the net proceeds from the planned offering to pay for its convertible note hedge transactions and other general corporate purposes.Borrowing costs continue to be low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. With the U.S. treasuries offering low rates, corporate bonds and borrowings from banks are now witnessing elevated demand. We believe these notes will provide financial flexibility to the company and propel long-term growth.Nonetheless, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company's profitability. It should be noted that at the end of first-quarter 2018, Nutanix had cash and short-term investments of $365.9 million.Nutanix stock has gained 58.3% in the past six months, substantially outperforming the 20.7% rally of the  it belongs to.Nutanix has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the same sector include Broadcom  , Analog Devices, Inc.  and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

acks  downgraded  to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Jan 15, 2018. Going by the Zacks model, stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #4 are likely to perform weaker than the broader market in the next one to three months.Fujifilm conducts its business in a highly competitive market. Extensive business rivalry makes consumers' demand highly elastic and hence exposes the company to risks to market share loss. In order to boost up brand recognition within the competitive industry, Fujifilm stays under constant pressure to make newfangled research and development investments. However, lofty innovation expenses often weighs on the company's aggregate margins, and proves to be futile if an innovation becomes obsolete.The company's overseas businesses are exposed to risks of adverse foreign currency translations. For instance, in second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues of Fujifilm's Documents Solutions segment were hurt due to negative foreign exchange translation impact.Moreover, Fujifilm predicts that uncertain geopolitical environment in the overseas market (like unclear impact of the Brexit referendum in Europe) might weigh over its near-term profitability.We also notice that revenues of Fujifilm's graphic systems business had dipped in second-quarter on account of reduced demand of major product categories such as CTP plates and graphic arts film. We fear that weaker demand might continue to hurt the company's graphics business and hence depress revenues of its Information Solutions segment.Revenues of Fujifilm's Documents Solution segment had dipped by almost 1% in second-quarter fiscal 2018 due to weaker sales generated from the Oceania end-markets. Sales of office printing business had dipped in Oceania, Japan and Asia; on account of an upward shift in price mix. Moreover, lower production services business in the United States and Europe has also weighed over the segment's performance. Also, revenues of the company's solutions and services business was also lower in the Asia and Oceania end-markets during the reported quarter. We fear that further downfall inOceania revenues might depress Fujifilm's aggregate revenues in the upcoming quarters.The stock's projected sales growth is 2.1% and EPS growth is 7% for fiscal 2018 compared to the respective tallies of 5.6% and 58.8% estimated for the industry. Notably, over the last 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fujifilm has moved south for both fiscal 2018 and 2019, reflective negative market sentiments.Some better-ranked stocks within the sector are listed below:Analog Devices, Inc.  currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has pulled of an average positive earnings surprise of 16.34% for the last four quarters. You can see  .Applied Materials, Inc.  currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

"echnology stocks had a prolific run in 2017, courtesy of the rapid adoption of cloud-based platforms, increasing demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and significant progress in developing advanced driver assisted system (ADAS) solutions.Moreover, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices became part of the mainstream technology market driven by significant investments from tech bigwigs - Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook.Further, Internet of Things (IoT) technology made rapid strides in 2017. Consumer as well as industrial products and machines were embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.According to latest  , technology sector's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to improve 14% from the same period last year on 8.5% higher revenues.Semiconductors are primarily gaining from strong demand for power-efficient and high-performance chips. These are essential to run cloud-data centers and process massive data by using IoT analytics, machine learning and deep learning applications.Moreover, the rapidly expanding IoT market is driving growth for chip components to power applications, particularly ADAS, medical/healthcare and smart devices. Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has evolved as another catalyst for semiconductor providers.We believe that these emerging trends have provided much needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to offset loss of business due to the shrinking PC market which still consumes bulk of chips.According to Gartner's latest data, PC shipments in the quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The downside marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.However, IDC's data contradicted Gartner's figures due to different techniques used for tracking PC sales as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. According to IDC, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm's previous prediction of a fall of 1.7%.2017 witnessed a plethora of cyber attacks. Two back-to-back ransomware attacks were reported - WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June - followed by the massive data breach at Equifax in September.In addition to these, the data theft and ransom paid by Uber disclosed in November fueled the bullish momentum of the stocks in this space. Notable companies like Mondelez, FedEx, Merck & Co. suffered from cyber attacks during the year, which may have a material impact on their financial performances.The frequency and severity of attacks have exposed the loopholes of the security systems deployed by enterprises worldwide. Further, with rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.These factors increased demand for advanced cyber security solutions that drove stock prices of cyber security companies in 2017.With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right technology stocks that have the potential to beat earnings can be a daunting task.

Chicago, IL - January 10, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,  ,  and  .The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including PepsiCo, Walgreens Boots and EOG Resources. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. 's shares have gained +15.7% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Soft Beverages industry, which has increased +17.4% over the same period. However, PepsiCo has been doing well on the back of significant innovation, continued momentum in Frito-Lay business, revenue management strategies, improved productivity and cost-saving initiatives, along with better market execution.Moreover, an improving economy, better industry pricing dynamics and a consistency in positive innovation bode well. It rolled out several products recently which management believes will drive sales and profits in 2018.That said, growing health awareness has been hurting the CSD category, resulting in a 4% volume decline in the first nine months of 2017 in North America. Again, rising volatility in global markets and increasing currency headwinds may dampen growth.Shares of Buy-rated  have done better than the embattled Zacks Drug Stores industry over the last year (WBA is down -10.7% vs. decline of -12.3% for the peer group). Walgreens Boots reported an impressive first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in sales at the Retail Pharmacy International is a major positive.Moreover, Walgreens Boots has been gaining on account of strategic tie-ups, which brought more patients to its U.S. pharmacies. The Zacks analyst likes the Rite Aid stores acquisition deal for which the company got regulatory approval recently. Also, the company is expanding its global footprint with its decision to acquire a 40% stake in Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores in China which should provide a strong impetus to Walgreens Boots' worldwide retail pharmacy business.On the flip side, declining sales at the Retail Pharmacy was a disappointment. The company faces tough competition along with currency fluctuations. Also, slowdown in generic introduction continues to weigh on margins.Buy-rated  ' shares have gained around +9% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks Oil & Gas E&P Industry, which has declines -11.1% over the same period. EOG Resources holds premium acreages in the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford oil shale plays in the United States.The Zacks analyst likes the firm's plan to complete 505 wells in the resources in 2017, significantly higher than 443 recorded in 2016. Notably, during 2016, almost 50% of the wells drilled by the firm met the standard of premium wells. The company expected 80% and 90% of the wells to meet the standards in 2017 and 2018, respectively.In the promising U.S. shale plays, EOG Resources has identified 8,000 premium wells that can give access to almost 7.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves over a period of 10 years. The upstream energy player's pricing chart history is also impressive.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Ford and Analog Devices.While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

 recently reported preliminary fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company anticipates revenues at the high end of the previous guidance of $130-$136 million issued on Oct 27, 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $133.2 million.The revenue guidance originally reflected a 2-7% increase on a sequential basis, driven by the comeback of the Client SSD Controller segment and stable SSD Solutions segment.Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin is now expected to be near the mid-point of the company's original range of 45.5-47.5%.The company is scheduled to release full fourth-quarter 2017 financial results on Feb 6, 2018.Silicon Motion shares have gained 25.8% in the past six months, massively outperforming the  's growth of 13.4%.Silicon Motion remains well-poised for growth, driven by synergies from acquisitions and improving NAND supply environment.Management expects the increase in the availability of 64 layer 3D NAND to bring down the high NAND prices, which will eventually improve the financial results. Enhanced supply of NAND flash is projected to drive growth of Ferri and Shannon SSD solutions. Additionally, as the company's pipelined product, 2nd generation PCIe NVMe client SSD controllers, enter into production, Client SSD Controller sales are anticipated to increase.Silicon Motion is active on the acquisitions front too. The company's buyouts include FCI, Centronix mobile tv and Shannon systems. These acquisitions have helped it to augment foothold in the mobile communications market.Moreover, the company outshines peers in providing resources for research and development. It develops affordable versions of TLC NAND flash as well as high-density 3D NAND. Moreover, Silicon Motion's robust liquidity position has allowed the company to undertake diligent capital deployment initiatives that supplement long-term growth.We also believe that an expanding product portfolio is the key catalyst.Silicon Motion carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

hares of  have struggled for quite some time now due to multiple headwinds. Consequently, the stock declined 21.1% in the last three months, significantly underperforming its  's rally of 6.9%.High costs are limiting bottom-line growth at ADTRAN for quite some time and the scenario is unlikely to change in fourth-quarter 2017. Detailed results should be out later this month.The below-par guidance issued by the company for the fourth quarter is in line with ADTRAN's recent struggles. Revenues for the quarter are estimated to be around $125 million (previous guidance: $155-$165 million). The top line is projected to shrink 22.8% on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the company expects revenues for the first quarter of 2018 at around the same range of its fourth-quarter 2017 revenues.In the final quarter of 2017, earnings per share (adjusted) are anticipated at around a penny. Fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 earnings are projected to decline 125% and 5.6% year over year, respectively. The negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has declined 24.4% over the last 90 days.The company's performance in the fourth quarter is likely to be significantly hindered by a merger-related review and slowdown in its spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer. ADTRAN's below par guidance, issued in December 2017, negatively impacted not only its own shares but those of telecom equipment providers like Clearfield  .In view of this gloomy scenario, we believe that investors should stay away from the stock right now.

With high-flying chip names such as Micron () and Nvidia () leading the way, semiconductor stocks were one of 2017’s best-performing groups.Despite ending the year on a rough note, where the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) declined almost 7% in late November, the SOX still crushed the broader market, posting 2017 returns of almost 40%, besting the 25% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a better-than 19% return in the S&P 500 Index. But as Lay’s has told us, when it comes to chips, you can’t eat just one.In that vein, unlike previous years, it was just the sexy growth chip names that dominated 2017. Even traditional powers like Intel (), which rose 30%, ranking as one of the better-performing Dow components, participated in the rally. Thanks to its  of Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye, Intel wrote its own narrative as a force to be reckoned with in the autonomous car market, which has become the new battleground for high-tech companies looking new revenue streams.Where Intel thrived Advanced Micro Devices (), which was an early chip favorite in 2017, ended the year on a sour note. This is even though the company’s earnings during 2017 were consistently above expectations. In Q3 the company crushed estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Yet, the stock took a pounding, falling — at one point — more than 15%. Investors were fearful about the company’s lower Q4 guidance, which overlooked that the fourth quarter, with its implied sequential revenue decline, was seasonally weak and has little to do with business fundamentals.Nevertheless, in this fickle market where tons of other growth options exist, investors opted to go elsewhere. And it would seem Micron (up 85% in 2017) — a stock  on March 23 at around $26 per share — and Nvidia (up almost 80%) were the beneficiaries. The former, which I proudly own, is operating on its stated objectives and better-diversifying the business, which — in my opinion — effectively removes the threat of what has been a highly cyclical industry for DRAM and NAND memory chip pricing.For Nvidia, few expected it would follow a colossal 2016 performance, during which it posted returns of 235%, with 2017 returns of almost 80%. But thanks to successes in high-growth markets like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, where its chips are at the center of autonomous driving technology, the company posted breathtaking top- and bottom line growth results throughout 2017, which has now crushed Wall Street's estimates the past two years.Elsewhere Broadcom () — though it didn’t get nearly the attention as Micron and Nvidia — was a clear winner. With better than 45% returns, the wireless giant, which has chip placement in both Apple () and Samsung () products, gives it an advantage over competitors. And its $130 billion offer for Qualcomm (), which if completed, would be the biggest-ever tie-up in the tech sector, suggest Broadcom has no plans to rest in search of value-creating opportunities.Which companies will be this year’s Micron, Nvidia or Broadcom? Though it’s early, I expect AMD to have a bounce-back year. Other names to keep an eye on include Analog Devices (), Cavium (), Texas Instruments (), and Xilinx ().Granted, as evidenced by their strong performances in 2017, lead by Texas Instrument’s 44% gain, these four are not in the discount bins. But not only are they solid in terms of execution (not one missed analysts top or bottom-line estimates in 2017), they each have extensive product portfolios, containing assets that serve multiple applications within primary end markets such as enterprise storage, industrials, wired and wireless businesses, which are all growing at double-digit rates.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Semiconductor Stocks: Year In Review; Where to Place Your Chips in 2018@2018-01-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-stocks-year-review-where-place-your-chips-2018-2018-01-05

 has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak, as the company's earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. We believe steady demand from pharmaceutical business, solid recurring revenues, strength in Asia as well as modest recovery in industrial markets will continue to be growth drivers, going forward.Driven by impressive growth drivers, the company's stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past three months. It has appreciated 6.5%, ahead of the  's average growth of 2.3%. We believe that the company's impressive traction across markets and strong product portfolio will drive growth.Read on to find out the key catalysts for the company right now.Waters Corp's key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Over the past few quarters, the company has delivered strong organic growth on the back of continuous operational improvement and judicious use of shareholder capital. Going forward, the company remains confident that modest recovery of industrial markets as well as recurring revenue growth will accelerate growth momentum. In terms of geography, impressive growth of recurring revenues is expected to fuel growth in Asia, which is contributing strongly to the overall top line.Being one of the leading players in the mass spectrometry market, the company has been gaining significantly from the sale of its advanced mass spectrometry instruments. Further, the company's global pharmaceuticals business is gaining traction over the last few quarters and fueling growth of Waters Division. Moreover, the company's Industrial business is proving to be a major profit churner on the back of increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications.Moreover, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company's mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive. Moreover, the company is benefiting significantly from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. This apart, its sound financial health adds to strength.Despite these positives, the company's high-debt levels and the consequent interest expenses remain a burden. In recent times, slower budgetary releases in the United States have hurt the pharmaceutical business in the country. Also, during the reported quarter, the company's sales were limited due to macroeconomic and government policy uncertainties, which seem to be affecting general business activity in the United States.Moreover, the company is grappling with high R&D expenses and stiff competition, which is hurting revenues as well as margins. This apart, recently, the negative impact of currency translation has reduced sales growth, and this remains a risk for future quarters as well, posing a risk to the company's financials.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Waters Corp.Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Analog Devices, Inc.  , Avid Technology, Inc.  and Nutanix Inc.  . While Analog Devices sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Avid Technology and Nutanix carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Analog Devices has surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 16.3%.Avid Technology has surpassed estimates twice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 18.3%.Nutanix has outpaced estimates in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 18.5 %.A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

 remains well-poised for growth, driven by synergies from acquisitions and improving NAND supply environment. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock bears immense potential owing to a few good growth drivers. However, growth momentum might get hindered by stiff competition and macroeconomic risks like political, economic and social instability.Shares of Silicon Motionhave gained 14.9% in the past three months, significantly outperforming the  's 5.2% rally.Let's now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company's performance.Silicon Motion is a leading developer of microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices and specialty RF ICs for mobile devices.The company is anticipated to benefit from an improving NAND supply environment. Management expects the increase in the availability of 64 layer 3D NAND to bring down the high NAND prices, which will eventually improve the financial results. Moreover, improved supply of NAND flash is expected to drive growth of Ferri and Shannon SSD solutions.Silicon Motion is active on the acquisitions front too. The company's buyouts include FCI, Centronix mobile tv and Shannon systems. These acquisitions have helped it to augment foothold in the mobile communications market.Moreover, the company outshines peers in providing resources for research and development. It develops affordable versions of TLC NAND flash as well as high-density 3D NAND. Moreover, Silicon Motion's robust liquidity position has allowed the company to undertake diligent capital deployment initiatives that supplement long-term growth.We also believe that an expanding product portfolio is the key catalyst.Silicon Motion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 2.1%.For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $3.18 and revenues of $578.8 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 22.4% and 11.1%, respectively.Intensifying competition in the USB flash drive controller market remains a major headwind.Moreover, we note that Silicon Motion currently has a trailing 12 month Price/Book Value (P/B) ratio of 3.77. This level compares unfavorably with what the industry witnessed over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 3.41. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/B perspective.NVIDIA Corporation  , DXC Technology Company  and Analog Devices, Inc.  are some better-ranked stocks in the same sector.

hares of  have been performing well of late. If you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, its time you hold the stock in your portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Shares of Cadence have returned 69.9% in a year, substantially outperforming the  's growth of 34.9%.NVIDIA, Western Digital and Analog Devices have a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%, 25.1% and 10.4%, respectively.Cadence is benefiting from ongoing adoption of its digital and signoff, custom-analog and IP solutions as well as expanding customer base.Further, increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity for the company in the long haul.Market research firm IDC estimates global IoT spending to grow at a CAGR of 15.6% over 2015-2020 time frame to hit $1.29 trillion in 2020. Moreover, the firm estimates AR/VR spending to accelerate at a CAGR of 198% over the same period to reach $143.3 billion in 2020. This presents significant growth opportunity for semiconductor chip makers as well as electronics sensor developers. We note that these two industries make the majority of customer base. We believe that the company's expanding product portfolio will help it to win frequent orders as well as new customers from these emerging markets going ahead.The company has also introduced a broad portfolio of interface and memory design IP solutions for automotive applications using TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET Compact process. We note that the expansion of Renesas agreement reflects the company's growing influence in the autonomous vehicle market. Of late, the company has won orders from well-known companies like MobilEye and Infineon who are developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) related technologies. This is a prudent step given the significant growth prospect of the ADAS market, which is estimated to be worth $42.40 billion by 2021, according to data from MarketAndMarkets.We also note that the company is focused on augmenting footprint in the aerospace and defense segment. Apart from having a dedicated team for the sector, Cadence has expanded systems business through partnerships with established sector players like Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and GE Aviation. We believe that these partnerships will help in driving the company's market position in the long run.Notably, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.9% in the last quarter. Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12%.However, intensifying competition, currency volatility, leveraged balance sheet and stretched valuation remain major headwinds.We note that Cadence currently has a trailing 12 month P/B ratio of 12.17, which compares unfavorably with what the industry observed to some extent, in the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 11.38 and is closer to the high end of the valuation range. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/B perspective.We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock at the moment.Cadence carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).NVIDIA Corporation  , Western Digital Corporation  and Analog Devices, Inc.  are some better-ranked stocks in the same sector.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $190.64 per unit.With SOXX trading at a recent price near $169.81 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.27% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SOXX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are ON Semiconductor Corp (Symbol: ON), Silicon Laboratories Inc (Symbol: SLAB), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although ON has traded at a recent price of $20.94/share, the average analyst target is 13.76% higher at $23.82/share. Similarly, SLAB has 13.53% upside from the recent share price of $88.30 if the average analyst target price of $100.25/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $100.67/share, which is 13.07% above the recent price of $89.03.

"re you still holding shares of  in your portfolio? If yes, then it's the best time to dump the stock as chances of favorable returns in the near term are slim.The stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months. Infineon's shares have registered a return of 5.4% compared with the industry's growth of 8.9%.Let's delve deeper and try to find out what is taking this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company down.Infineon designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductors as well as complete systems solutions. The company reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. Although, revenues increased 8.7% year over year to $2.15 billion in the quarter, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 billion.Moreover, management guidance was disappointing as first-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to decline.The company continues to encounter difficulties with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry that witnesses price erosion and evolving standards. Further, Infineon faces strong seasonal fluctuations in product supply and demand, and any adversity in seasonal conditions may affect sales, going forward.Further, intensifying competition in the automotive and power market segments is a major concern. Additionally, weak Chip Card & Security (""CCS"") revenues will continue to hurt top-line in the near term.Estimates for the current year have moved south in the past 60 days. The company's current year earnings estimates moved down by 11 cents to $1.15 per share. Given its weak fundamentals and an unfavorable Zacks Rank, it is likely to keep underperforming in the quarters ahead.Given the other unattractive attributes like low return on equity (""ROE""), low return on capital (""ROC"") and low return on assets (""ROA"") the stock looks very unappealing. Infineon currently trades at a ROE of 18%, much lower than the industry's average of 22.3%. Moreover, the company has a ROA of 10.2%, much lower than the industry's average of 12.4%. Notably, the company has an ROC of 13.5% compared with the industry's average of 16.2%.Infineon has an unimpressive earnings surprise history. The company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a negative average earnings surprise of 9.1%.We expect the aforementioned factors to hurt the company's near-term profitability. Hence, we recommend investors to stay away from Infineon shares until its Zacks Rank and estimates improve.NVIDIA Corporation  , Western Digital Corporation  and Analog Devices, Inc.  are some better-ranked stocks in the same sector.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next quarter is currently pegged at 47 cents per share compared with 46 cents per share projected 30 days ago. Notably, none of the estimates moved downward.The company recently announced collaboration with NEC Corporation to provide support to NEC's newly announced SX-Aurora TSUBASA systems with its InfiniBand adapters. InfiniBand is highly scalable and its off-loading capabilities that reduce load on CPUs are attracting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning providers. These design wins are likely to aid top-line growth.Apart from strong demand for Mellanox's InfiniBand solutions, collaborations with the likes of Atos, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have helped it expand footprint in the cloud and datacenter market.Mellanox is winning contracts from the likes of NetApp. Additionally, the company's collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also anticipated to reinforce its footprint in the high performance computing market going forward.Market research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. This exponential growth bodes well for Mellanox's interconnect solutions owing to growing demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data.Looking at these positives, we believe that Mellanox is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors' portfolio. Consequently, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Mellanox sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 (NASDAQ: ADI) turned in a stellar fourth-quarter report on Nov. 21 that comfortably beat Wall Street's expectations, but investors weren't impressed. Despite reporting growth across all its business segments and issuing upbeat guidance, Analog saw its shares tumble. It seems investors were looking for something more than just a beat-and-raise performance, though it is unclear as to what else Analog needed to do to win investor confidence.In fact, Analog Devices' impressive string of financial results has been largely overlooked by investors this year, as evidenced by its 17% gains versus the NASDAQ 100 Technology Sector index's 36% jump. data by But the key takeaways from Analog Devices' latest report indicate that the company won't remain in the shadows for a long time. Here are some solid catalysts that could take the chipmaker to new highs in the long run.The industrial business supplies 47% of Analog's total revenue, and it is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Linear Technology acquisition completed earlier this year. More specifically, the chipmaker's industrial revenue grew a massive 82% year over year in the latest quarter thanks to the acquisition, and it could keep getting better because of the synergies that Linear brings.For instance, Linear's ultra-low power connectivity sensors and network management system is already deployed across a wide range of industrial and building automation applications. These products complement Analog Devices' front-end connectivity modules and controllers, setting the company on its way to tap the fast-growing industrial automation space.Transparency Market Research forecasts that the global industrial automation market will grow from just over $182 billion in 2015 to more than $352 billion in 2024. This will create more demand for sensors and management systems needed to enable and monitor automation in factories and other industrial applications.The good news is that the combined company has been able to enhance its customer base and gain new business at existing clients thanks to an expanded product portfolio. Therefore, Analog investors can expect the company's industrial business to keep getting better in forthcoming quarters, as it can capture a bigger share of the growing industrial automation market based on a stronger product lineup.Image Source: Getty Images.Analog Devices' consumer and communications businesses supplied 21% and 18% of its total revenue, respectively, in the latest fiscal year. Both of these segments have been growing at a tremendous pace, driven by the presence of solid catalysts such as smartphones and small cells.The consumer business has won big from the retention of the 3D Touch feature in  's latest iPhone lineup. Analog was expected to lose its Apple business -- there were rumors that Cupertino would  from its new phones. But this hasn't been the case, and an expected increase in iPhone builds will boost Analog's business, as it has reportedly supplied  to Apple this time.IDC forecasts that Apple's iPhone shipments could increase 9.1% next calendar year, following a meager 1.5% increase in 2017. Therefore, the growth of Analog's consumer business seems secure given its Apple relationship, while the communications business is also set to get better because of the evolution of networking technology.Analog Devices' communications business has grown tenfold over the past four years, driven by demand for its radio solutions that are used in Multiple Input/Multiple Output (MIMO) and small-cell applications. Both of these technologies play a critical role in enabling high-speed networks, so Analog will continue witnessing strong demand in this area as faster networks such as 5G gain in popularity.According to one estimate, spending on 5G infrastructure is expected to clock an annual growth rate of 70% through 2025, hitting a size of $28 billion. Now, small cells play an important role in both 4G and 5G deployments, allowing mobile operators to  volumes by providing additional spectrum at a lower cost when compared to constructing a full-fledged base station.Analog thus has a big opportunity to increase sales of its RadioVerse technology, which allows telecom providers to upgrade their base stations from 4G to 5G with the help of small cells and MIMO systems.Quite evidently, Analog Devices is sitting on a variety of catalysts that should help secure its long-term growth,  , which could win big from the growing adoption of electric vehicles.Not surprisingly, analysts expect the chipmaker's earnings to increase 18% annually for the next five years, which is higher than the 16% annual growth seen in the last five. This is why investors should keep faith in Analog Devices, since it has the potential to deliver more upside in the long run despite lagging the market so far this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In June, Analog acquired Hittite Microwave Corp (HITT) to complement its Radio Frequency (RF) and signal conversion expertise. Then in July, management announced the acquisition of Linear Technology to increase its presence and portfolio of products in the industrial, communications infrastructure, and automotive sectors.In order to integrate these two new companies within Analog, the board of directors hired a new CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. Prashanth has a solid track record in finance and integration experience.

We believe that Microchip's expanding product portfolio driven by new launches will continue to expand customer base.Moreover, the company is winning market share as reflected by SIA numbers. It had a market share of 15.84% in the third quarter, which expanded 138 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Management noted that design win funnel continues to be and will increase organic growth.

Therefore, we believe that Microchip with its lower forward P/E valuation of 16.3x compared with the industry average of 27.5x may be a great bet.Thus, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corporation  , Intel Corporation  and Analog Devices, Inc.  are some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector.

Let's delve deeper and find out.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings as well as for 2018 being revised downward over the past 90 days, thus reflecting a negative outlook of analysts.

This implies that the stock is overvalued.Badger Meter's third-quarter 2017 earnings declined 10% year over year, affected by elevated brass and other costs. The bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although sales in the quarter increased 3.9% year over year, the metric fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Municipal water sales, which represent around 75% of total third-quarter sales, were impacted by lower sales of residential meters and related technologies.Badger Meter continues to bear the brunt of rising  , which will hurt its margin performance. Further, delayed orders of the ORION Cellular LTE endpoint will likely dent its municipal water sales in the next quarter. Also, the company noted that sales from the Middle East continue to be irregular in nature. Moreover, higher debt to total capitalization, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality-control costs remains concerns for the company.Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Applied Materials, Inc.  , Allied Motion Technologies Inc.  and Analog Devices, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

" recently announced that it has partnered with HomeLab to create a healthy home environment. The partnership will leverage Philips Air Purifier tool along with professional grade AeraSense technology to automatically monitor, react, as well as purify indoor air, capturing 99.97% of particles. In fact, incorporating Philips Air Purifier into HomeLab's Healthy Home Program will make it easier to track and control air quality in home, facilitating healthier homes.Combining HEPA and VOC purifier with a professional grade PM2.5 monitor, the Philips 2000i Smart Air Purifier tracks pollution trends as well as decrease allergens simultaneously. The active carbon filter aids in trapping toxic gases (VOCs), while the HEPA filter traps minute particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust mites, pet dander, pollen and mold.Philips Air Purifier's unique numerical index, connected app and corresponding color ring, alerts users even if there is a minor change in indoor air conditions, supporting HomeLab's analysis. The collaboration will enable users to visualize allergen levels with the color coded ring and watch air improvement simultaneously as the purifier is set to work. It will also allow users to control the device from smart phones as well as view both indoor as well as outdoor pollution.In the past couple of years, Philips has successfully morphed from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. However, the company's near-term profitability is likely to be hurt by sluggish growth prospects of the healthcare market on a global scale. In light of uncertainties like slowing government spending and events surrounding the Affordable Care Act (""ACA"") legislation, the company expects the United States to witness low-single digit growth in the healthcare industry.Moreover, country-specific risks for China like anti-corruption initiatives, slow GDP growth and centralized tendering are likely to dampen the prospects of the healthcare industry, thwarting growth. Also, in the HealthTech Other vertical, the company anticipates incurring approximately EUR 80 million of net cost, higher than previous guidance.

imilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in MTSI.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen seven estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $2.55 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.47.Also, for the current quarter, MACOM Technology has seen five downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 13 cents a share from 45 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 16.1 % in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Analog Devices, Inc.  .

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: FTXL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $33.91 per unit.With FTXL trading at a recent price near $30.29 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.95% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FTXL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are ON Semiconductor Corp (Symbol: ON), Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (Symbol: CY), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although ON has traded at a recent price of $19.98/share, the average analyst target is 18.69% higher at $23.71/share. Similarly, CY has 18.55% upside from the recent share price of $15.69 if the average analyst target price of $18.60/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $100.33/share, which is 17.13% above the recent price of $85.66. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ON, CY, and ADI:Combined, ON, CY, and ADI represent 11.02% of the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Implied FTXL Analyst Target Price: $34@2017-11-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/implied-ftxl-analyst-target-price-34-2017-11-30

"Chicago, IL - November 29, 2017 -  highlights  as the Bull of the Day and  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  .Here is a synopsis of all three stocks:Founded in 1965 and headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts,  is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.The company's products include data converters, amplifiers and linear products, radio frequency integrated circuits, power management products, and sensors and processing products.The chipmaker reported excellent results for its Q4 ended October 28, beating our estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Adjusted earnings of $1.45 per share beat were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and up 38.1% year over year.Revenues jumped 53.6% year over year to $1.54 billion. Results were driven by strong growth across all segments.""The fourth quarter of 2017 drove a strong finish to the fiscal year, with high-quality revenue growth and operational execution that expanded gross and operating margins, and delivered stellar earnings per share growth,"" said the CEO.The company has retuned approximately $8 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases in the past 10 years.They have been consistently increasing their dividends and aim to increase their dividend by 5% to 10% annually.Earlier this year, the company completed the acquisition of another analog chipmaker Linear Technology for about $14.8 billion. The merger is expected to reduce Analog's reliance on Apple while deepening its competitive moat and adding products in other fast-growing categories.Analysts have significantly raised their estimates for the company after strong earnings and upgraded guidance. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year are now $5.23 per share and $5.61 per share, up from $4.96 and $5.42, 30 days ago.The company has a pretty good record at beating estimates, with not a single miss in the past five years; the average quarterly beat for the last four quarters was more than 16%. :Global oversupply of grains is creating headwinds for agribusiness stocks.Headquartered in White Plains, NY,  is a leading agribusiness and food company with integrated operations all over the world. It is a global leader in oilseed processing, and grain & oilseed marketing. The company has five business segments: Agribusiness, Edible Oil Products, Milling Products, Sugar and Bioenergy, and Fertilizer.The company IPO'd in 2001 and has expanded though many significant acquisitions since then.The company reported adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. Their Sugar & Bioenergy was impacted by lower than expected Brazilian  .""Our earnings improved sequentially and year-over-year, although they continued to be impacted by market and industry headwinds. As a result, we are reducing our earnings guidance for the year in Agribusiness and Sugar & Bioenergy,"" said the CEO.Analysts have been slashing their estimates for the company after weak results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next year have fallen to $2.97 per share and $4.85 per share from $3.42 and $5.14 respectively, 30 days back.Farmers and agribusinesses have been struggling due to bumper crops over the past few years.As the company generates most of its revenues from its Agribusiness segment, it remains vulnerable to commodity price, weather and foreign exchange trends. Further the company does not have any pricing power and operates on thin margins.The stock is down more than 10% this year but a rebound does not appear likely any time soon.Shares of Buffalo Wild Wings gained more than 6.3% in morning trading Tuesday after the company announced that it was being acquired by Arby's Restaurant Group. Arby's will pay about $2.4 billion, or $157 per share, for the chicken wing chain.""Buffalo Wild Wings is one of the most distinctive and successful entertainment and casual dining restaurant companies in America,"" said Arby's CEO Paul Brown in a statement. ""We look forward to leveraging the combined strengths of both organizations into a truly differentiated and transformative multi-brand restaurant company.""Roark Capital Group, a private equity firm that owns Arby's, will finance the deal. Roark and Arby's will also assume the debt of Buffalo Wild Wings.At $157 per share, the deal values the home of ""wings, beer, and sports"" at a 7.2% premium to its Monday close. This buyout price is a 34% premium to BWLD's close on Nov. 13, which was the last trading day before media reports that a buyout offer had been made started to emerge.Buffalo Wild Wings has struggled recently, as industry-wide pressures and the rising price of chicken wings have put a damper on shares. These challenges brought criticism from investors, culminating in Mick McGuire's activist firm Marcato Capital Management encouraging long-time CEO Sally Smith's departure this summer.Still, Buffalo Wild Wings has worked to bolster foot traffic to its restaurants with new wing promotions, and management has touted its investments in delivery. Nevertheless, investors have been clamoring for a sale to a private equity firm, which is becoming a trend in today's restaurant space.Last month, casual dining chain Ruby Tuesday was purchased by NRD Capital for about $335 million. JAB Holdings, a Luxembourg-based firm, has taken U.S.-based chains Panera Bread and Krispy Kreme private over the past two years.Once the deal closes, Buffalo Wild Wings will operate as an independent, privately held unit of Arby's. Looking ahead, lower grocery prices and competition from fast-casual chains will continue present challenges for the company, so it will be important for management to successfully adapt.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

 is currently one of the top-performing stocks in the technology sector and a rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal its bullish run. Therefore, if you haven't taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it's time you add the stock to your portfolio.The company has performed extremely well this year and has the potential to carry on the momentum in the near term. A glimpse of the company's price trend shows that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourses year to date. Analog Deviceshas returned 20.4%, comparing favorably with the S&P 500's gain of 16.7%. Analog Devices sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Momentum Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment. Twelve estimates for the current year have moved north over the past 30 days against no southward revisions, reflecting analysts' confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.0%. Also, for fiscal 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has inched up 4.0% to $5.59. Analog Devices has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 16.3%. The company's Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings of $5.21 reflects year-over-year growth of 10.41%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 7.22% growth in fiscal 2019. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10.4%. Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits.In the recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter, the company's pro forma earnings of $1.45 per share beat the consensus mark by 8 cents. Earnings also increased 15.1% sequentially and 38.1% year over year. Also, revenues of $1.54 billion beat the consensus mark by $37 million and were at the high end of the guided range of $1.45-$1.55 billion.The better-than-expected results were driven by strength across all the markets - industrial, automotive, consumer and communications.While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks also ensures investor loyalty.Going forward, Analog Devices will see significant opportunities from super trends like autonomous driving and the electrification of the powertrain.We believe that Analog Devices is in a great position to grow sustainably and profitably based on its strong pipeline of enabling technologies, supported by expanding opportunities on the semiconductor front and strength in all its end markets. | Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation  , SMART Global Holdings, Inc.  and Lam Research Corporation  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

 (NASDAQ: ADI) stock got a  earlier this year after a terrific third-quarter report put to rest  of its  (NASDAQ: AAPL) contract. The chipmaker beat Wall Street's earnings forecasts and issued stronger-than-expected guidance in late August, and this helped catapult the stock price to 52-week highs.Analog Devices investors will be looking forward to a new set of catalysts when it releases its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Nov. 21. But can the company deliver once again?Image Source: Getty ImagesAnalysts expect Analog Devices' top line to jump almost 50% year over year to $1.5 billion, boosting its earnings from $1.05 per share in the year-ago period to $1.36 per share this time. However, it won't be surprising if the chipmaker manages to exceed expectations and its own guidance thanks to a bunch of strong catalysts.Apple, for instance, could significantly boost Analog's top line as it has retained the 3D Touch feature across all of its latest iPhones. Analog supplies the technology that helps Apple bring this feature to life. In fact, Analog reportedly gets 13% of its total revenue by supplying these chips to Apple, so it wasn't surprising to see the chipmaker in trouble when rumors about Apple eliminating the feature in this year's iPhones started circulating.But this isn't the case anymore. Apple's production ramp-up of its iPhone models could help Analog deliver a beat as its fourth quarter runs from August to October. According to supply chain reports, Apple had begun ramping up iPhone production last month, boosting iPhone X production by four times to 400,000 units a week.On the other hand, the production of the iPhone 8 models was reportedly boosted in August ahead of the September launch. As a result of strong production numbers, Apple  for the September quarter, but also released a terrific guidance for the current one, putting manufacturing concerns to rest.This sets the stage for Analog to issue a strong guidance once again as iPhone production is set to hit a higher gear in the December quarter. For instance, TrendForce believes that iPhone X production could hit 27 million units this quarter (around 2.25 million units a week), and keep rising going into the new year.More importantly, Analog's iPhone-related gains will be augmented by a potential increase in the amount of money it makes from each device. This is because the 3D Touch module for the new OLED-based iPhone X is reportedly costing around 60% more than what Cupertino paid for last year's models.Not surprisingly, Analog's consumer revenue had shot up 36% year over year during the third quarter as it benefited from the iPhone production ramp and richer content. So, it won't be surprising if Analog smashes it out of the park once again.There's no doubt that Apple will be a critical factor driving Analog's results and outlook, but there are a variety of catalysts that could power its growth in the long run. For example, the chipmaker's automotive business has started gaining critical mass ever since it closed the acquisition of Linear Technology in March this year.Analog Devices' automotive revenue had jumped 25% on a sequential basis during the third quarter, while the year over year jump was even stronger at 69%. This makes it evident that the Linear Tech acquisition has opened the floodgates for Analog to attack the automotive opportunity.In fact, Analog Devices believes that its addressable automotive market could increase rapidly in the coming years, driven by a two-fold jump in semiconductor content to $500 per vehicle that puts its revenue opportunity at $3 billion. In perspective, Analog and Linear are just scratching the surface as they pulled in combined automotive revenue of $900 million last year.Therefore, Analog Devices' automotive revenue is in for a massive jump once again this time as the integration of Linear Technology continues. More importantly, the chipmaker is targeting fast-growing niches within the automotive space to augment growth, such as battery management systems (BMS) for electric vehicles (EVs).Analog's BMS platform is capable of enhancing the driving range and battery life of EVs, and the company is busy pushing the envelope in this space by developing a wireless solution. This will help the chipmaker  in this space, helping it achieve its ambition of doubling its chip content in EVs in the future.Therefore, Analog Devices is on track to deliver a strong quarterly report and follow up the same with a robust guidance.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IWR, ZTS, LRCX, ADI: ETF Inflow Alert@2017-11-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iwr-zts-lrcx-adi-etf-inflow-alert-2017-11-20

 is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 20, after the closing bell.While the company has been gaining from an expanding online consumer base, its performance is challenged due to higher promotional spending. Notably, Vipshop has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the past four quarters. Its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding quarter.With these aspects in mind, let's delve deeper on how things are shaping up for Vipshop's upcoming results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at 15 cents and has been stable in the past 30 days. Estimated earnings are in line with the prior-year figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,230 million in the said quarter, depicting a growth of 23.9% from the year-ago quarter. | Vipshop has been struggling with higher promotional spending to attract customers amid a highly competitive online retail market. This has led to lower gross margin in the past few quarters, thereby affecting the company's profits. As a result, the company's shares have underperformed the  in the past six months. Its shares have lost 39.2% compared with the industry's decline of 0.4%.Vipshop expects this trend of increased promotion spending to linger in the third quarter as well, which is a threat to its bottom-line performance. Further, the company's performance is expected to be hurt by costs associated with investments in improving delivery operations and expanding the internet finance business.Nonetheless, we expect Vipshop's top line to benefit from consistent efforts to add customers in the third quarter. The company has been dedicatedly adding strategic units, warehouses and delivery stations to augment customer base. Also, Vipshop has been investing in upgrading its technology to enhance the shopping experience of online customers. While these endeavors bode well for the company's quarterly results, the aforementioned factors pose significant concerns.Our proven model does not show that Vipshop is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

ales of electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to take off remarkably in the future. Last year, EV sales crossed the 2 million mark, accounting for just a fraction of the 88.1 million units in global auto sales. But Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that EVs will supply 54% of new car sales by 2040 thanks to plunging battery prices. (NASDAQ: ADI) is one of the best ways to ride this rapid growth as its battery management products are critical to the functioning of EVs. More specifically, these battery management systems (BMS) are the brains of the battery pack used by EVs, managing several functions such as charging, discharging, and protecting the individual batteries from getting damaged.The spurt in EV sales will drive BMS sales at a fast clip, with one estimate suggesting an annual growth rate of over 20%. Therefore, Analog Devices has set its sights on making the most of this fast-growing opportunity through product development moves and a crucial acquisition, which could substantially boost its revenue in the long run. Let's see how.Image Source: Getty ImagesAnalog Devices has pulled in just under $4.6 billion in revenue over the past year and a strong foothold in the BMS space could be a big long-term catalyst for the company. So the company is going all out to carve a bigger share of this market for itself on the back of its BMS platform that's geared to deliver several incentives to EV makers.Analog Devices claims that its BMS solution can increase the driving range of EVs by over 25 miles, delivering over $500 in cost savings to the car maker. The company also advertises that the system can extend the battery life of EVs by more than 10 years. But Analog isn't done yet pushing the envelope as its next-generation solution will help it deliver a wireless BMS platform to EV makers.As a result, the chipmaker's solution will become more reliable by eliminating the safety hazards related to wires and connectors. It will also reduce the weight of the BMS, helping EV makers deliver a longer range to consumers. This should extend Analog Devices' first-mover advantage in the BMS market when compared to rivals such as  or  .More specifically, Analog's BMS product is already in its fourth generation, and it should keep getting better after the acquisition of Linear Technology that was closed earlier this year. The acquisition has significantly improved Analog's standing in the automotive space, boosting the segment's revenue 69% year over year during the third quarter.This, however, is just the beginning as Linear's power management products will complement Analog's existing line-up by delivering increased power density and reduced emissions. More importantly, the Linear Technology acquisition has given Analog's automotive business more weight as both companies had combined revenue of $900 million from this segment last year.But it won't be long before the automotive business gets even better as Analog expects its chip content in EVs to double going forward. This could increase the company's addressable market in electric vehicles to $3 billion in the next five years as stronger chip placement will be complemented by a surge in sales. By comparison, the company's end-market opportunity in the EV space currently stands at $1.5 billion.Therefore, Analog can win big from the EV space provided its execution remains strong, which will eventually lead to a stronger earnings performance.Analog Devices is definitely not cheap given its  (P/E) ratio of almost 43. This is significantly higher than the industry average of almost 25. But investors shouldn't forget that the massive opportunity present in  BMS, factory automation, and consumer electronics could lead to annual earnings growth of, according to analyst estimates, more than 18% over the next five years, higher than the 16% annual growth it has delivered in the last half-decade.Considering this potential earnings growth, it isn't surprising to see why Analog's forward P/E ratio is less than 18, which makes the stock an enticing bet going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them!

" reported adjusted earnings of 33 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents in third-quarter 2017. Further, adjusted earnings fell 25% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings per share of 31 cents, down 11.4% compared with the year-ago figure. A rise in total costs, along with cost of investment in new business areas proved to be a drag on the earnings performance.Total revenues in the quarter was $842,820 million, up 0.5% year over year on a reported basis. However, revenues were flat, when adjusted for currency impact.As for the segments, on a reported basis, Small and Medium Business (""SMB"") Solutions revenues dipped 7.4% year over year to $ 414 million. The tepid performance was due to softness in the North American Mailing business (down 8.6%) and International Mailing Business (down 3%). Lower recurring revenue streams and lower sales in the top of the line products led to the lackluster performance of the North American Mailing business. Additionally, decline in recurring revenues proved to be a drag on the International Mailing Business.Enterprise Business Solutions (""EBS"") revenues increased 1.4% year over year to $223.5 million. Decent performance form Presort Services (up 4%), partially offset by the production mail business (down 1.9%) drove the top-line growth of this segment. Higher print equipment sales bolstered performance of the production mail business. Higher support services revenues also proved conducive to the growth of this segment.Digital Commerce Solutions reported 19% year-over-year growth in sales to $205.6 million, on the back of strong Global e-commerce (up 28%) as well as Software Solutions businesses (up 12%). Impressive performance in all cross-border geographies and growth in domestic shipping acted as tailwinds for the Global e-commerce business. Growth in the Software Solutions business was primarily driven by higher license revenue, mainly in Location Intelligence and Customer Information Management. | Exiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, free cash flow was $108.9 million compared with $119.9 million as of Sep 30, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,697 million compared with $764.5 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2017, was $3,562.7 million, down from $2,750.4 million as of Dec 31, 2016.The company tweaked guidance for full-year 2017. It expects earnings per share to lie in the range of $1.38-$1.46, compared with the earlier guided range of $1.70-$1.78. Revenues, on a reported basis, are expected to grow in the range of 3-5% year over year compared with the previous guidance of flat to 1% growth.Pitney Bowes believes that new products and digital capabilities of SMB, expansion of the Presort Services network and robust e-commerce volume growth will act as major catalysts, stoking top-line growth for full-year 2017. Moreover, the company's focus on operational excellence will help it trim costs and expenses, consequently supplementing growth.Pitney Bowes' concerted efforts to transform business have started to show results as evident from growth across most business lines. The transformation initiatives and constant introduction of new products have also provided a boost to performance. This apart, the company's prolonged effort to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform also bode well for the company.Moreover, the company's Global e-commerce business is proving to be one of the strongest profit churners, and is anticipated to boost top-line growth in the upcoming quarters as well. In less than five years, Global e-commerce has grown from $20 million business to a worth of over $400 million. The company also anticipates segment's growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of growth in overall retail volumes and customer wins.However, continued softness in the mailing business is likely to affect Pitney Bowes' growth momentum for the quarter under review. Lower recurring supplies revenues are expected to adversely affect the mailing business in the upcoming quarter. Additionally, currency fluctuation remains a headwind.Pitney Bowes currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Adobe Systems Incorporated  , Analog Devices, Inc.  and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  . While Adobe Systems sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Analog Devices and Advanced Micro Devices carry Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Adobe Systems has a decent earnings surprise history, surpassing estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.8%.Analog Devices has an impressive earnings surprise history, exceeding estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 19.1%.Advanced Micro Devices has an impressive earnings surprise history, exceeding estimates in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 31.7%.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, ADI makes up 4.78% of the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSI) which is trading up by about 1.4% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADI Dividend Yield Pushes Past 2%@2017-10-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adi-dividend-yield-pushes-past-2-2017-10-27

Among the largest underlying components of IWP, in trading today Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is trading flat, Zoetis Inc (Symbol: ZTS) is up about 1.4%, and Illumina Inc (Symbol: ILMN) is up by about 0.9%.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IWP, ADI, ZTS, ILMN: ETF Inflow Alert@2017-11-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iwp-adi-zts-ilmn-etf-inflow-alert-2017-11-01

Sales improvement was primarily driven by double-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions as well as mid-single digit growth in Healthcare Informatics.On a geographic basis, while growth geographies witnessed mid-single-digit growth, mature geographies posted a low-single-digit decline. Double-digit growth in China, Middle East & Turkey and Latin acted as catalysts.Revenues in the  segment continued to show weakness, shrinking 7.7% to €108 million ($127 million). The decline in this segment can mainly be attributed to higher restructuring charges incurred during the quarter.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Exiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, Philips' cash and cash equivalents rose to €999 million ($1,180.2 million) from €1,859 million a year back. The company's long-term debt fell to €4,441 million ($5,246.2 million) compared with €4,860 million a year ago.Philips has been gaining significantly from its DfX program, along with other productivity and savings programs. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, while accelerating growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in the reported quarter, the company achieved procurement savings of €77 million, powered by the DfX program, while other productivity programs also resulted in a savings of €69 million. The company now is well on track to generate an impressive annual savings of €400 million.The quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips announced the acquisition of Health & Parenting to strengthen its offerings in pregnancy and parenting. Health & Parenting is a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents.The company also inked an agreement to buy image-analysis software provider, TomTec Imaging Systems GmbH. This acquisition is likely to enhance the former's image-guided therapy portfolio.Further, earlier this month, the company obtained the 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing its new eL18-4 transducer for 'small parts' assessment. The company is anticipated to launch the newest solution at the 16th World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (""WFUMB"") Congress in Taipei.At the end of the third-quarter 2017, Philips holds 41.27% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Philips Lighting shares. Philips aims to sale the business completely over the next few years.Based on the present market scenario and accounting for the macroeconomic headwinds, Philips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4-6%. The company also anticipates its Adjusted EBITA margin to improve around 100 basis points this year.In the past couple of years, Philips has successfully evolved from a lighting company into a healthcare technology provider. Moreover, the company's transformation from a hardware-oriented to a software-driven business, with a higher-margin and recurring-revenue model, bodes well for investors. The company also believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will drive future growth.Further, the company is highly optimistic about the prospects of its Diagnosis & Treatment vertical on account of positive industry trends, with the Image-Guided Therapy and Ultrasound equipment segments acting as major profit churners. This apart, the company's Connected Care & Health Informatics vertical is progressing well, and is experiencing strength in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.Though, healthcare markets hold solid prospects in the long run, lackluster performance in key end markets, including the Western Europe and North America are thwarting the growth momentum of the Dutch multinational. Also, higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges are proving to be a drag on the company's financials.Philips currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some stocks worth considering in the same space include Applied Materials, Inc.  , Analog Devices, Inc.  and Amphenol Corporation  . While Applied Materials sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Analog Devices and Amphenol Corporation carry a Zacks Rank #2.

 reported third-quarter 2017 IFRS earnings per share of €0.82 (95 cents), reflecting a surge of 35% on a year-over-year basis. This improvement was primarily attributable to growth in the cloud subscriptions as well as software license order entry. The bottom line, however, misses the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share.Total IFRS revenues for the third quarter were €5,590 million ($6,497.3 million), up 4% year over year. Also, the figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,470 million. A flourishing cloud business along with strong growth of support revenues, aided the top-line growth during the third quarter.Also, new cloud bookings - a key indicator of sales success in cloud business - were significantly up 14% to €302 million ($351 million) in the reported quarter.Cloud and Software business, which includes Cloud Subscriptions & Support and Software licenses & support, reported third-quarter revenues of €4,657 million ($5,412.8 million), up 4.5% year over year. IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €937 million ($1,089.1 million) in the quarter, up 21.8% year over year; while non-IFRS Cloud Subscriptions & Support garnered revenues of €938 million ($1,090.2 million) in the quarter.Software licenses & support reported revenues of €3,720 million ($4,323.8 million), up 0.9% on a year-over-year basis. Also, for third-quarter 2017, Services revenues inched up 1.3% year over year to €932 million ($1,083.3 million). Overall, IFRS Cloud and software revenues witnessed growth, mainly driven by strong IFRS Cloud Subscriptions and support revenue.The EMEA region observed double-digit software license revenues rise in majority of the end markets, including Germany, Russia and the Middle East & North Africa region. For the APJ region, SAP witnessed a strong performance in both cloud and software revenue plus cloud subscriptions, along with robust performances in Australia and China, acting as key catalysts.The company reported IFRS operating margin of 23.5%, up 300 basis points from the figure recorded in third-quarter 2016. Also, the company recorded a 19.1% rally in operating profit amounting to €1,314 million ($1,527.3 million). | SAP's human capital management (''HCM'') applications continue to act as a key growth-driver with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 2,000-customer base at the end of the third quarter. In addition, SAP's Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions once again achieved double-digit growth in new cloud bookings as well as software revenue.Additionally, consistent strong market traction of the SAP S/4HANA platform is proving to be a strong profit-churner. During the reported quarter, the company gained 600 additional customers with more than 40% being entirely new. This uptrend hugely drove the company's revenues. With little competition in its core market, the software and service provider experienced strong results in the third quarter in the aforesaid segment.This apart, SAP's business networks (which it manages through three main players namely, Ariba, Fieldglass and Concur) burgeoned 19% during the reported quarter. Currently, the Ariba network handles trading worth around $1 trillion of 3 million connected companies. This upside hugely drove the company's revenues. While Concur manages travel and expenses of more than 50 million end users, Fieldglass helps managing 3.9 million flexible workers.For the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the company's operating cash flow came in at €4.1 billion ($4.8 billion), up 14% on a year-over-year basis. While free cash flow was €3.2 billion ($3.8 billion), up 7% compared with the year-ago tally.Fueled by continued strong momentum of the cloud business, SAP raised its view for full-year 2017 non-IFRS total revenue projection from €23.3-€23.7 billion to €23.4-€23.8 billion at constant currency (cc).The company believes the non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to lie in the €3.8-€4.0 billion range at constant currencies. Also, non-IFRS cloud and software revenue outlook has been revised upward. It is expected to grow in the band of 7-8.5% instead of the previous 6.5-8.5% view at cc. Also, non-IFRS operating profit forecast for 2017 has been tweaked at the lower end of the earlier guided range. It is now estimated to be in the range of €6.85-€7 billion compared with the former €6.80-€7 billion band at cc.SAP's resilient Cloud and Software business, an enviable business network spread and dominance over critical client demand areas continue to act as staple growth-drivers. The company's S/4HANA has proved to be a solid profit-yielder, fueled by an increase in cloud subscriptions as well as support-revenue rise in recent times.Also, SAP's new class of solutions that power the next generation of business applications - SAP HANA - has been its biggest top-line driver ever since its introduction. The company's latest offering from the SAP HANA family, S/4HANA, has established itself as a mission critical control center for businesses pursuing digital transformation. This apart, the company constantly upgrades the existing products and launches new ones to expand its customer base, thereby offering a competitive edge over peers.However, dull prospects of the global IT industry in recent quarters along with flat customer spending projections have affected the company's performances. Also, over the past few quarters, many of the company's emerging markets have faced fiscal imbalances besides general economic slowdowns, which have adversely impacted the consumers' purchasing power. Currency fluctuations in many of the company's key markets are also hurting its financial performance.SAP currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Adobe Systems Inc.  , Analog Devices, Inc.  and Nutanix Inc.  . While Adobe Systems and Analog Devices carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Nutanix sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Adobe Systems has a striking earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters, having outpaced estimates all through with an average beat of 7.8%.Analog Devices has delivered earning beats in each of the trailing four quarters. It boasts an average beat of 19.1%.Nutanix has an excellent earnings surprise history, beating estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 12.9%. You can see  .It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

hareholders of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $105 strike and collect the premium based on the $3.50 bid, which annualizes to an additional 3.2% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 5.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $105 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but ADI shares would have to advance 17.9% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 21.8% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 covered call at the $105 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $105. (  ). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Analog Devices Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $89.43) to be 22%.

" believe the stock market has changed for the better in the past few weeks. Fundamentals are still bearish, but the economic news has been a little better. Most importantly, the technicals have improved. This a bull market again. Let me show you why...I'll start with a chart of small-caps. Below is the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:  ). The blue rectangle shows a 10-month trading range. The upside breakout occurred coincided with a ""buy"" signal from my Income Trader Volatility (ITV) indicator, which is shown at the bottom of the chart. (For more on this award-winning indicator,  .)
  
Small-caps are important because they lead the market both up and down. They are the most aggressive stocks, the ones investors buy for growth and sell at the first sign of the trouble. The breakout from a 10-month trading range is likely to be the beginning of a big move.The trading range is an example of a pattern technical analysts call a ""big base."" This pattern has worked well for predicting major market moves since the 1920s, for every market from commodities to foreign stock markets. Essentially, a big base provides the foundation for a large move.With the foundation for a large move in place, it's important to consider which stocks could be the biggest winners. After all, we want to beat the overall market, right? Testing has shown that the biggest winners of the past six months are likely to be market leaders over the next six months, so I took a look at which index has been the best performer over the past months.The chart below, from StockCharts.com, shows that the  is our winner.So, that's where I went looking for this week's featured trade for my premium newsletter,  manufactures analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment. These technologies are used to convert, condition and process real-world phenomena -- such as light, sound, temperature, motion and pressure -- into electrical signals. Its customers include Apple, Boeing and a number of other defense contractors, along with carmakers and chip manufacturers.ADI is a buy based on the technicals shown in the chart below. It's a more complex chart than I usually use, so I'll explain it.The blue rectangle again highlights a big base, this one about eight months wide. I added Bollinger Bands to the price frame, as well as the Bollinger BandWidth indicator, which is the blue line in the bottom panel. The stochastic indicator, a measure of momentum, is in the center. The two green arrows show indicator action that is similar to the current pattern.ADI is breaking out of a big base, and the price is at the upper Bollinger Band. Momentum (the stochastic) is bullish. The Bollinger band pattern indicates volatility is likely to expand, confirming the base seen on the chart. The price pattern, volatility (as measured with Bollinger Bands), and momentum all point to potential gains in the stock.The stock is currently trading around $88.55, about 7% below analysts' consensus estimate, which is about $95. But if you account for the stock's growth rate, I believe ADI's fair value is a little lower than that.A stock's fair value would be the price where the P/E ratio equals the EPS growth rate. Analysts expect ADI to grow earnings at about 18.2% a year. The consensus earnings estimate for this year is $4.62 per share. Based on those estimates, I believe the fair value of ADI is about $84.I have a great deal of confidence in the earnings estimate because ADI has exceeded analysts' expectations for 12 consecutive quarters. The last time earnings came in below expectations was the first quarter of 2013.All of this means that a trader would be relatively safe in thinking that ADI won't be selling under $80 any time soon. And that's where my time-proven system comes in.What many investors don't know is that this pricing also sets up a high-probability, high-income opportunity in Analog Devices in short-term options that expire before the next earnings announcement. Rather than buying the stock and hoping for the best, or shorting and hoping for an earnings disappointment, this surprisingly simple options trade allows us to take a greater gain in a shorter time.The strategy I'm using for this trade, selling put options, is the same one my  readers and I have been using to make thousands of dollars in extra income each month. In this case, if ADI stays above $80 into the end of November, you could earn an easy 2.5%. This may not sound like much, but the short timeframe means that it works out to an annualized return of over 21%.And what happens in case of a drop in price could be even better. If our pick is trading under the expected price when your options expire in a month, you get to essentially buy the stock at an even greater discount (a full 10% less), leaving you with a solid stock at a price you could never get by waiting for price drops. This means the worst that could happen is that you're left with an incredible, growth-ready stock at an unbeatable price.If you're still unsure, let me give you one more assurance that this is as close to risk-free as  gets. All of my recommended trades are assessed by my award-winning ITV system. This system has allowed my subscribers and I to achieve a spectacular trading record: Since 2013, over  of the trades I've recommended have been winners.If you're interested in learning how you can generate a track record like this, I've put together  , as well as more info on how my  subscribers and I are taking control of our portfolios to  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Chart Pattern Has Been Predicting Big Moves Since The 1920s@2017-10-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chart-pattern-has-been-predicting-big-moves-1920s-2017-10-16
" recently revised its proposed deal to takeover NXP Semiconductors N.V.  in order to get regulatory nod from the European Commission (EC), which is a major part of the European Union. Notably, Qualcomm's proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors is facing a few problems.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has time till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. The EC has already halted its review twice -- once in June and again in August. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On October 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, ""Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data"".Importantly, in September 2017, Qualcomm extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP. The tender offer will now expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Oct. 20, 2017.Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company's shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP's outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP's total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Moreover, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the closure of the transaction.The major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company's business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.Qualcomm's shares have decreased 4.15% compared with the  decline of 2.25% in the last three months. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

hares of  , popularly known as MPS, have rallied to a 52-week high of $111.55 and eventually closed at that price on Oct 10, up 2.7% from the previous session.The momentum can be attributed to the company's consistent execution and significant growth potential in the newer markets like Automotive, Industrial, Server and Communications.In the second quarter of 2017, revenues jumped 19.3% year over year to $112.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $111 million. Top-line growth benefited from strong sales in the server, high-end notebook, solid state drives (SSDs) and gaming.Moreover, earnings of 68 cents per share surged almost 26% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, MPS has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all of the trailing four quarters with a positive average of 1.99%.Currently, MPS has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, the stock has a market capital of $4.50 billion.Further, the stock has returned 36.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 23.8% rally of the  it belongs to.MPS is anticipated to benefit from improving penetration into new high-growth consumer markets - Automotive, Industrial, Server and Communications.Automotive presents significant growth opportunity for MPS. Management believes that total automotive SAM (serviceable available market) is worth almost $6 billion and growing dollar content is beneficial for the company. We also note that the company has a strong clientele in the automotive market, which includes Delphi Automotive Plc  , Mitsubishi, Magna and others.MPS is now focused on expanding beyond infotainment applications into body electronics, LED lighting applications and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). These are the key catalysts in the long term.Moreover, we believe MPS is well positioned to benefit from the launch of Intel Corporation's  Purley server platform. The shift from Intel's Grantley to Purley boosts MPS' dollar content. Management stated that dollar content for 2 CPU servers has increased from $35 (in Grantley) to $49 (in Parley). For 4 CPU configurations, this further improves from $53 to $85.Management expects that the recently initiated conversion cycle (Grantley to Purley) and the higher dollar content will definitely boost top-line growth.We believe the strong growth prospects at the Automotive and benefits from the Purley conversion will help MPS to achieve revenue growth target of 20% per year with expanding margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has remained steady at $2.88 over the last 30 days. The estimate for fiscal 2018 has also been steady at $3.61 over the same time frame.Analog Devices Inc  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is a stock worth considering in the same sector. You can see Long-term earnings growth for Analog Devices is currently pegged at 10.40%.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of IWR, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IWR's low point in its 52 week range is $164.99 per share, with $199.57 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $199.51.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@IWR, ADI, ZTS, FIS: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2017-10-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/iwr-adi-zts-fis-large-inflows-detected-etf-2017-10-05

.S. mobile chipset giant,  recently announced that Qualcomm River Holdings B.V., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, has extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP Semiconductors N.V.  . The tender offer is now scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Oct. 20, 2017.Qualcomm's proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors is facing a few problems. On Oct 27, 2016, the company entered into a definitive agreement with NXP to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would bel paying $110 per NXP share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company's shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP's outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to just 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP's total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.Meanwhile, in June 2017, the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry.The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has a time limit of 90 working days, till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.The major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company's business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

 or TI recently took the wraps off a buck converter, which it claims to be the industry's first 16-V input, 40-A synchronous DC/DC buck converter.Known as TPS543C20 SWIFT, it features an internally compensated advanced-current-mode (ACM) control topology that supports frequency synchronization. The converter offers improved efficiency by integrating low resistance high- and low-side MOSFETs into small-footprint package that is thermally efficient.Two converters can be stacked side by side for handling loads up to 80 A for processors in power dense and space constrained applications.The new buck converter finds use in several markets such as communications, cloud computing and enterprise and thus should strengthen the company's presence in these markets.As the company continues to leverage on its expertise in analog and embedded products and systems to launch compelling products for different markets, we believe the move is intended to boost TI's Analog segment revenues.In the last reported quarter, the segment was up 6.9% sequentially and 18% from the year-ago quarter. It generated 65% of quarterly revenues. (Read more:  )The move highlights Texas Instruments' R&D investments in several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to industrial and automotive markets and increasing dollar content at customers, while reducing exposure to volatile consumer/computing markets The company has been integrating different functionalities into single devices, encouraging customers to go for the simpler, more power efficient and smaller form factor products that could potentially lower the cost of ownership and could be used in the smallest of applications. For TI, this increases the dollar content per device, helping share gains and margin expansion.

"Chicago, IL - September 01, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Merck (NYSE:  -  ), Caterpillar (NYSE:  -  ), Intel (NASDAQ:  -  )Analog Devices (NASDAQ:  -  ) and Best Buy (NYSE:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the last year, gaining +3.3% versus +7.5%. However, Merck has been pursuing acquisitions and business development deals to boost its pipeline. New products like Keytruda and Zepatier should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line.Keytruda is gaining strong momentum from new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in the first half with several key regulatory approvals.Meanwhile, Merck will continue to focus on cost-cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line. However, generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line. Rising competition in the immuno-oncology market is also a significant concern. The Zacks analyst discusses all of these issues in the updated research report issued today.(You can  .Shares of Strong Buy-rated  have gained +29.7% year-to-date, outperforming the Zacks Construction and Mining industry which has increased +27.2% over the same period. Caterpillar has been awarded a five year $663.6 million fixed-price contract from the Pentagon to supply commercial construction equipment. Caterpillar reported 12% rise in sales in July, its best performance so far in 2017.Backed by upbeat results and improved order activity, Caterpillar hiked revenue guidance to the range of $42-$44 billion and projects earnings per share of $5.00. The Zacks analyst thinks Asia Pacific will continue to be a catalyst for both Resource Industries as well as construction, owing to increased infrastructure and residential investment in China.Leading indicators of U.S. construction signal robust conditions ahead that bode well for Caterpillar. Further, efforts to reduce costs will boost margins.(You can  .Buy-rated  's shares have lost -1.7% year to date, in contrast to the broader Technology sector as well as the red-hot semiconductors space (each up +19.7%). But Intel's growing focus on the data-centric part of the business is encouraging. The launch of Xeon Scalable is anticipated to improve its footprint in the data center as well as AI space, going forward.The company unveiled Myriad X, which will boost footprint in the IoT space. Moreover, the recent Core 8 launch will boost PC market share amid intensifying competition from AMD. Further, anticipated improvement in cost structure and lower spending, primarily due to improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins going forward.Additionally, aggressive share buyback will boost the bottom line in 2017. However, Top-PC makers like HP, Lenovo, and Asus are set to launch PCs based on Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon processor, which is a headwind for the company. Moreover, declining PC-shipments is a concern.(You can  .Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Analog Devices (NASDAQ:  -  ) and Best Buy (NYSE:  -  ).Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Large Cap US Equity Select ETF (Symbol: RNLC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $21.77 per unit.With RNLC trading at a recent price near $19.82 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.84% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RNLC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (Symbol: GT), Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although GT has traded at a recent price of $29.98/share, the average analyst target is 29.53% higher at $38.83/share. Similarly, QCOM has 26.85% upside from the recent share price of $52.12 if the average analyst target price of $66.11/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $94.18/share, which is 12.49% above the recent price of $83.72. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of GT, QCOM, and ADI:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Surprising Analyst 12-Month Target For RNLC@2017-08-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surprising-analyst-12-month-target-rnlc-2017-08-31
"ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 9/7/17, Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), Teradyne, Inc. (Symbol: TER), and TELUS Corp.

Analog Devices Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.45 on 9/19/17, Teradyne, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.07 on 9/29/17, and TELUS Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.4925 on 10/2/17. As a percentage of ADI's recent stock price of $83.34, this dividend works out to approximately 0.54%, so look for shares of Analog Devices Inc to trade 0.54% lower - all else being equal - when ADI shares open for trading on 9/7/17. Similarly, investors should look for TER to open 0.20% lower in price and for TU to open 1.35% lower, all else being equal.When an S&P 1500 component reaches 20 years of dividend increases, it becomes a contender to join the elite ""Dividend Aristocrats"" index.

Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.

If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.16% for Analog Devices Inc, 0.79% for Teradyne, Inc., and 5.42% for TELUS Corp..In Tuesday trading, Analog Devices Inc shares are currently down about 1.2%, Teradyne, Inc. shares are down about 0.7%, and TELUS Corp. shares are up about 0.1% on the day.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Ex-Dividend Reminder: Analog Devices, Teradyne and TELUS@2017-09-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-dividend-reminder-analog-devices-teradyne-and-telus-2017-09-05
ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH) where we have detected an approximate $52.9 million dollar outflow -- that's a 6.4% decrease week over week (from 9,370,937 to 8,770,937). Among the largest underlying components of SMH, in trading today ASML Holding NV (Symbol: ASML) is up about 1.7%, Applied Materials, Inc. (Symbol: AMAT) is up about 0.1%, and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) is relatively unchanged.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SMH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SMH's low point in its 52 week range is $63.06 per share, with $89.72 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $88.32. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Semiconductor ETF Experiences Big Outflow@2017-09-07@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etf-experiences-big-outflow-2017-09-07

er a recent report by Forbes, U.S. mobile chipset giant,  's  proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant  is facing a few problems.In October 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with NXP to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would bel paying $110 per NXP share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.Per the report, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company's shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP's outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to just 6.9% in August. Notably, at least 70% of NXP's total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.Meanwhile, in June 2017, the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in-depth if the deal could lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has a 90-working-days' time limit, until Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.The major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company's business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.Qualcomm's shares have decreased 12.11% compared with the  decline of 6.51% in the last three months. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

"roadcom () is set to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday.The semiconductor giant, which also has a leading position wired infrastructure and wireless communication markets, has seen its stock rise near all-time highs, delivering year-to-date returns of 45%, besting not only the 9% rise in the S&P 500 Index, but also doubling the 20% rise in the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF ().Broadcom’s outperformance in the chip sector, compared to peers such as Analog Devices (), Cavium (), Texas Instruments (), and Xilinx (), continues to be driven by its extensive product portfolio, containing assets that serve multiple applications within four primary end markets, including enterprise storage and industrials which — in addition to its wired and wireless businesses — are all growing at double-digit rates.As such, analysts expects Broadcom not only to report year-over-year increases in both revenue and profits, but also to issue strong guidance for the just-begun quarter. For the quarter that ended July, Wall Street expects the Singapore-based company to deliver $4.03 per share on revenue of $4.46 billion, translating to year-over-year increases of 39% and 17.2%, respectively.For the full year, ending October, earnings are projected to rise 37.7% year over year to $15.77 per share, while full-year revenue of $17.6 billion would mark a 32.4% increase year over year. As breathtaking as the top and bottom-line expectation might appear, they may yet underestimate what Broadcom is able to do.In the second quarter the company delivered EPS of $3.69, which was enough to beat the highest Street profit estimate by 19 cents and earning its twelfth straight earnings beat. Meanwhile, second quarter revenue of $4.2 billion grew 18% year over year, topping estimates by $100 million, logging its sixth consecutive top-line beat, driven by a 45% revenue surge in the wireless business. These events have, understandably, ratcheted up expectations.On Tuesday John Vinh, analysts at KeyBanc, who has $280 price target on AVGO stock, reiterated his Overweight rating, citing Apple's () upcoming iPhone launch. In a note to investors, Vinh wrote that Broadcom is ""one of the best-positioned suppliers to benefit” from the new iPhone, which is expected to be unveiled next month.Broadcom’s relationship with Apple, to which it provides wireless components for the iPhones, is seen as a potential near-term catalyst for the rest of the year an beyond. The device is said to support wireless charging technology from Broadcom, among other components that are estimated at a $500 million to $600 million business win for Broadcom.With the stock already trading at all-time highs, it seems the market has already priced in these potential catalysts. But given Broadcom’s strong track record of execution, buying high with the expectation to sell even higher remains a good strategy.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Broadcom (AVGO) 3rd Quarter Earnings: What to Expect@2017-08-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/broadcom-avgo-3rd-quarter-earnings-what-expect-2017-08-24
 (NASDAQ: ADI) has been  of the loss of its spot in  's (NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming iPhone. Its shares have underperformed the  index by a fairly wide margin this year (9% gains as compared to the sector's 21% jump) as shareholders' confidence has taken a hit. But savvy investors should look at Analog Devices' weakness as an opportunity in disguise.Apple is not a huge component of Analog Devices' overall business, as Cupertino reportedly supplies around 12% of its total revenue. The chipmaker has enough catalysts that could mitigate any potential loss of business from the iPhone maker. This is why investors need to pay close attention to the company's third-quarter earnings report (scheduled for Aug. 30) and take a closer look at the two key trends that could impact its performance going forward.Image source: Getty Images.Analog Devices'  accounted for 44% of its total revenue last year, so the segment is crucial to the chipmaker's long-term growth. The good news is that the industrial business's growth has hit a higher gear this year, with revenue increasing 18% in the first six months of 2017.The company's industrial business has been catalyzed by the acquisition of Linear Technology, which was completed in March. Linear's specialization in making chips for the industrial and automotive markets should be a boon for Analog Devices. The combined technological expertise of the two companies will allow Analog to make a bigger dent in these markets, which could be really big in the long run.For instance, industrial and automation is one of Analog Devices' subsegments within the industrial business. This division seems set for consistent growth thanks to the growing implementation of real-time analysis of factory processes to reduce waste, increase productivity, and enhance automation. In fact, PricewaterhouseCoopers forecasts that factory automation could increase semiconductor demand by almost 10% a year until 2021.Analog Devices' estimates suggest that factory automation could open up a $4 billion revenue opportunity by 2022 on the back of increased semiconductor demand. The company's annualized revenue from this arena currently stands at $500 million, while its total industrial revenue last year stood at just over $1.5 billion.More importantly, Analog Devices seems well-placed to tap the opportunity in factory automation.Analog Devices has been supplying automotive chips for quite some time, and gets 15% of its revenue from this space. The company generated $525 million of revenue from this segment in 2014 and is on track to pull in $578 million this year. That's a 10% increase.But Analog investors will be expecting more from the company's automotive segment given the growth of the market and this is where Analog's Linear Technology acquisition will come into play, as the two companies generated a combined automotive revenue of $900 million last year.Analog Devices investors can expect the automotive segment to gain more traction as it continues to integrate Linear into its business. More importantly, the acquisition has strengthened Analog's position in the automotive space by increasing its addressable opportunity. The company now believes that its business opportunity from each vehicle will increase to $600 in 2025 as compared to the current chip content worth $250.Analog Devices' quarterly report and guidance for the rest of the year should make it clear whether the company has been able to retain its chip spot in the next iPhone. But investors shouldn't panic even if it misses out on the iPhone opportunity, because the secular growth opportunities in the automotive and industrial segments should give a nice boost to Analog Devices in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" is collaborating with The Cornucopia Project and ripe.io to aid crop quality, yield and profitability enhancement initiatives.The Cornucopia Project is a Peterborough, NH-based nonprofit organization that conducts agricultural and garden projects for students from elementary to high school.San Francisco, CA-based ripe.io focuses on integrating Blockchain consisting of a framework of distributed ledgers, application program interface (API), Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors, and connected food supply chain workflow with the food system.We observe that Analog Devices shares have rallied 9.2% year to date, underperforming the  's gain of 15.2%.The collaboration aims to train students and farmers on how to monitor crop quality as they move from ""Farm to Fork,"" thus facilitating improved decision making. While financing will be done by all three, Analog Devices and ripe.io are in charge of technical training.Most importantly, Analog Devices will make available a prototype version of its crop monitoring solution for use in the project. It is a sensor-to-cloud, IoT solution that boosts farmers with improved decision making on the basis of collected knowledge from near-real-time monitoring.ripe.io, on the other hand, is providing its block chain technology aiming to develop a fresh produce supply chain with farmers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, food service and end consumers.Kevin Carlin, Vice President, Automation, Energy and Sensors at Analog Devices stated that the project is an expansion of the company's 'Internet of Tomatoes' program that aims at improving farmers' decision making on farming cycle and quality of produce. | We believe the move is intended to increase the popularity of Analog Devices' crop monitoring solution offering.Funding training projects does initially act as a drain on cash balance and weighs on margins but can be fruitful in the long term if used tactfully. Given that Analog Devices has a strong market position across industrial, communications infrastructure and consumer markets, moves like this could help it attract new customers and keep the existing ones hooked on its services.The company has been strengthening its balance sheet, expanding margins and improving cash generation capacity through continued focus on product innovation. This is required especially when it's increasingly facing tough competition from the likes of Texas Instruments  , Maxim Integrated Products  and Broadcom Limited  .Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market's record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There's a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector.

"n about a month,  (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to unveil a trio of iPhones that are expected to help boost Apple's iPhone business -- by far its largest and most important -- over the next year.When Apple wins, its suppliers tend to win, too. At a minimum, if Apple's iPhone sells better during this cycle than it did in the last, a supplier that maintained the same share within Apple's devices stands to benefit.Image source: Apple.There are some suppliers, like  (NASDAQ: AVGO) , that stand to benefit by more than just pure iPhone unit growth; Broadcom management indicated on its June  that its dollar content within the next iPhone should grow by about 40% year over year.That's some sweet growth.That content growth, analysts with KeyBanc said in a recent note (via  ), will be driven by the addition of three new chips.""We believe the three new incremental chips will be for wireless charging, RF, and force touch,"" the analysts said.Given that Broadcom has talked at length in the past about how increased cellular capabilities drive the need for increased RF (radio frequency) content, an additional RF chip seems reasonable. Broadcom has also been rumored for some time to be working with Apple on a wireless charging solution for the new iPhones, so that, too, checks out.And, finally, while  (NASDAQ: ADI) is believed to have been the supplier of the 3D Touch solution for the iPhone 6s series and iPhone 7 series, there have been rumors floating around that Broadcom would displace Analog Devices -- at least in part -- in the upcoming iPhone.Seemingly based on this view, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh reportedly reiterated an overweight rating and a $280 price target on the stock (which would represent about 10% upside from current levels).Though I share Vinh's optimism around Broadcom's business performance during the upcoming iPhone cycle, I'm not in a hurry to go out and buy Broadcom stock solely based on this. Here's why.Broadcom is a great company that executes well in just about every market that it participates in, thanks to strong engineering teams and shrewd management that aggressively weeds out losers in its technology portfolio and actively feeds the winners.Broadcom is a technology company that's run like a  good investment fund.However, Broadcom's business and engineering excellence is already known, as is the company's upcoming dollar content increase in the new phone (remember:  ), so there's not much opportunity for Broadcom to surprise the investment community -- at least regarding its wins at Apple.Now, not everything regarding the Apple wins are currently known; Apple might see better demand than expected for its new iPhone models (though Apple's expectations already seem huge, based on its  ), which could push Broadcom's financial results (and possibly stock price) up further.At the same time, there's risk that Apple's new phones don't do as well in the market as Apple hopes, leading it to slash component orders, which would be a negative for Broadcom.In short, the big picture from a financial perspective with respect to Broadcom and the coming iPhone cycle is already known; all that's left is for Broadcom's quarterly financial performance to fill in the details.As far as Broadcom stock goes, I'm not making a call here either way -- I think it's a well-run company with a strong management team and exposure to a lot of interesting markets. On that basis, I might consider buying the stock, but I'm not rushing to buy the stock solely because of the already-known dollar content increases in the next iPhone.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 , one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits, will report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 30, before the bell.The company's earnings surprise history has been much impressive as it has beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive beat of 18.6%. The stock, however, has underperformed the  year to date. It has gained 8.7% compared to the industry's rally of 14.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices generated revenues of $1.15 billion, up 16.6% sequentially and 47.4% year over year. The year-over-year increase was attributable to improved performance across all markets.The company completed the acquisition of Linear Technology which contributed $208 million to revenues.The merger of Linear Technology with Analog Devices has created an analog industry leader with an extensive range of products, customer breadth and scale. The deal has significantly expanded Analog Devices' total addressable market allowing it to cater to phenomenal demand in some of the most attractive markets such as industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure.These positives along with the integration process are expected to make more meaningful contributions in the to-be-reported quarter.Analog Devices has been benefitting from strength in the markets of industrial, automotive, consumer and communications, and increased focus on innovation and operational execution. While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and fending off competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.For the third quarter, management expects continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth and revenues in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses are expected between $430 million and $440 million.The company expects interest and other expenses of approximately $70 million, tax rate of approximately 10% and earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.21. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.14, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.15. Therefore, the Earnings ESP for the stock is -0.64%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement.Here are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:InterDigital  , with an Earnings ESP of +10.45% and a Zacks Rank #1.Applied Materials  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.34% and a Zacks Rank #1.

That way, investors can watch broader industry trends and have some idea of how those trends will affect a company.Let's go over the four major end markets Analog Devices services.Analog Devices' largest market segment by revenue during its fiscal 2016 was the industrial market, making up 44% of its revenue during that year. In its form 10-K, Analog Devices goes over the major sub-segments within industrial.The first sub-segment is ""industrial and automation,"" which the company says includes applications such as robotics, weigh scales, oscilloscopes, environmental control systems, and more.The next one is ""defense/aerospace."" Analog Devices says that, within this end market, its chips are used in applications such as navigation, radar, security, and even space and satellite communications.The third is ""energy management,"" which the company says can include chips used in utility meters, wind turbines, and more.And, finally, there's healthcare. Within this sub-segment, Analog Devices says it provides chips for things such as CT scanners, X-ray machines, blood analyzers, ultrasounds, and more.So it's clear why this segment is Analog Devices' largest: It seems to be the company's broadest.This segment has grown modestly since 2014, with revenue rising from $1.344 billion that year to $1.502 billion in fiscal 2016. However, in 2014, this segment made up 47% of the company's overall revenue, so it's become a slightly smaller part of the company's revenue over the past few years.Analog Devices' second-largest business segment, by a small margin, is communications.""Communications technology involves the processing of signals that are converted from analog to digital and digital to analog form during the process of transmitting and receiving data,"" Analog Devices explains.The company then notes that the ""need for higher speed and reduced power consumption, coupled with more reliable bandwidth-efficient communications, creates demand for Analog Devices' products. Those products, Analog Devices says, ""are used in the full spectrum of signal processing for internet protocol, video streaming, voice communication, and machine-type communications.""The company says its revenue from the communications segment was about $667 million in its fiscal 2014, making up 23% of its revenue at the time. During fiscal 2016, this segment generated a bit more than $690 million in revenue and made up 20% of the company's overall revenue.So, as is the case with the industrial segment, Analog Devices' revenue here has grown since fiscal year 2014, but it has become a smaller part of the company's overall business.Analog Devices' third largest business segment is its ""consumer"" segment. The company doesn't go into a lot of detail about the products it builds here, but it says chips in its consumer segment go into ""portable devices (smartphones, tablets and wearable devices) for media and vital signs-monitoring applications,"" as well as ""prosumer audio/video equipment.""During the company's fiscal 2014, the consumer segment generated almost $328 million in revenue, accounting for 11% of the company's business. However, this business popped during Analog Devices' fiscal 2015, with revenue more than doubling to nearly $730 million.The business was a little down from fiscal 2015 levels in fiscal 2016, generating a bit more than $688 million, though it was still up substantially from fiscal 2014 levels. This surge is believed to have been driven by Analog Devices' supplying a key 3-D Touch component for the iPhone 6s-series smartphones, as well as the subsequent iPhone 7-series smartphones.Should Analog Devices retain its position in the upcoming iPhone models, its consumer business should easily ascend to become its second-largest business by revenue.The final segment Analog Devices serves is the automotive industry. Although a recent surge in interest in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars has been a boon for some chipmakers that have traditionally had little to no content in cars, Analog Devices' automotive business doesn't seem particularly exciting, probably because it has supplied products into this market for quite some time.In fiscal 2014, Analog Devices' automotive business, which the company says involves selling a ""broad portfolio of analog, digital, and MEMS"" integrated circuits, generated about $525 million in revenue.In fiscal 2016, the business generated almost $541 million in sales, making up just 16% of the company's total revenue. That was down from 18% in fiscal 2014, but up from 15% in fiscal 2015, which was a flat year for the business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares QQQ ETF (Symbol: QQQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $150.93 per unit.With QQQ trading at a recent price near $137.59 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.70% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Symbol: ALXN), Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), and Qualcomm Inc (Symbol: QCOM). Although ALXN has traded at a recent price of $122.43/share, the average analyst target is 27.17% higher at $155.69/share. Similarly, ADI has 20.49% upside from the recent share price of $77.74 if the average analyst target price of $93.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting QCOM to reach a target price of $65.60/share, which is 19.10% above the recent price of $55.08. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ALXN, ADI, and QCOM:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Anticipate QQQ Will Reach $151@2017-06-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-anticipate-qqq-will-reach-151-2017-06-30

Also, the firm issued a price target of $55.Following the news, Microsemi'sshare price was up by 0.89% and closed at $47.75. In the last one year, Microsemi has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry. While the stock returned 47.5%, the industry gained 44.1%.We believe strategic positioning, strong fundamentals and efficient execution to be tailwinds for Microsemi.Mark Delaney, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects the sales figure to increase in the coming days, driven by growth in the company's end markets namely, Defense & Aerospace, Communications, Data Center and Industrial markets.In the Defense & Aerospace market, Delaney expects increased spending and content gains in this market. In the last reported quarter, Defense & Aerospace generated 25% of sales, which was up 1% sequentially. Delaney said, ""The 2018 U.S. defense budget proposal targets a 10% year-over-year spending hike.""With the defence and aerospace markets showing promise, the analyst believes Microsemi is well positioned to take advantage of this trend in the future.Coming to the Communications market, Delaney expects strong growth in the company's optical networking products. The expectation is based on 100G metro/provincial build-outs in China and in the USA. In the last quarter, this market accounted for around 38% of revenues, which increased 6% sequentially and 5% year over year.Also, the analyst expects Microsemi to win share gains in the Data Center market. He believes that Intel's  forthcoming server chip named Purley will increase the company's chip sales used in servers.Moreover, the analyst remains impressed by Microsemi's cheap valuation in comparison to its peers namely Analog Devices Inc.  Broadcom Ltd. and Texas Instruments Inc. With Microsemi's sustained focus on growth areas, sound fundamentals and strength within the semi space, the analyst has a positive view on the company's future success.Microsemi Corp. is an OEM of a broad range of high-reliability and analog/mixed signal integrated circuits. We believe that its compelling products, scope for margin expansion, new design wins and solid execution will take it from strength to strength.The company's focus on improving product mix, operational efficiency and consolidation, will drive its revenues and gross margin through the second half of 2017.Additionally, Microsemi delivered an average positive earnings surprise of almost 5.30% in the trailing four quarters. The company's strong market position, its compelling product lines, strong revenue growth, continued innovation and long-term growth potential place it favorably in the market.The company is expected to report fiscal third-quarter 2017 results on July 27.Currently, Microsemi has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"Shutterstock photo (  ) believes that clouds have silver linings - and it intends to mine them.[ibd-display-video id=2062098 width=50 float=left autostart=true] The Lowell, Mass.-based chipmaker sees an enormous opportunity to supply internet cloud data centers with semiconductor systems to support ever-faster networking capability.Macom Chief Executive John Croteau touted his company's potential to gain business from data-center customers during a recent conference call with analysts, calling them a ""predictable, high-value growth driver for the company for many years to come.""""Personally I haven't seen such a breakout in our part of the industry since the advent of digital handsets and smartphones decades ago,"" Croteau said during the April call. ""It's shaping up to be that big.""In the March quarter, data center sales accounted for 27% of Macom's revenue and the group was its largest end market. Sales in the segment were up 70% year over year, excluding its acquisition of AppliedMicro, which it completed in the quarter.Macom is focusing its resources on maximizing market share gains in the cloud data center market, where demand for its systems is outstripping supply.""With rapidly developing backlog, program awards and customer commitments, it's now clear that 100G and greater optical connectivity in data centers is real and it's far bigger and (happening) far sooner than anyone in the industry has predicted,"" Croteau said.The optical-fiber business has shifted from the ""notoriously cyclical"" carrier-based deployments to cloud data centers, which have ""insatiable demand"" for faster and higher bandwidth connectivity, he said. That shift was evident at the Optical Fiber Conference and Exhibition in Los Angeles in March, Croteau said.Networking gear maker  (  ) predicts that internet cloud traffic will nearly quadruple from 2015 to 2020, going from 3.9 zettabytes per year to 14.1. (One zettabyte is equal to 1 billion terabytes.) That includes everything from business software applications to consumer video streams.""Macom is well positioned with a portfolio spanning high-performance analog, lasers, silicon photonics, optical subassemblies and mixed signal (chips) across all protocols and form factors,"" he said.Macom is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday.Analysts expect Macom to earn 69 cents a share, up 35%, on sales of $196 million, up 38%, in the June quarter.Optical-component sales for cloud data centers are likely to be the main driver in fiscal third-quarter results, Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg said in a July 11 report. But the sector is expected to face continued headwinds from an inventory buildup in China related to delays in telecom infrastructure upgrades, he said.For the September quarter, Wall Street is modeling Macom to earn 76 cents a share, up 41%, on sales of $205 million, up 34%.Macom stock has been a top performer of late.

The Amazon deal could lead to business from other providers of cloud computing services, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a June 26 note to clients.""With the industry's broadest portfolio of electronic, photonic and subassembly solutions for datacom modules, Macom in the past has discussed opportunities to partner directly with leading hyperscale operators,"" Bolton said.

hares of  (NASDAQ: ADI) shot up to multiyear highs after the company's second-quarter results blew past expectations. The analog semiconductor specialist was in hot water earlier this year after Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang  that it might lose its Force Touch spot in  's (NASDAQ: AAPL) next iPhone because of cost cuts at Cupertino.But Analog's latest results and guidance have put any apprehensions to rest, as they have clearly boosted investor sentiment, thanks to the growing strength of its industrial and automotive businesses. Here's why I see both businesses as crucial to the company's long-term growth, along with its Apple account.Image Source: Analog DevicesAnalog Devices gets 46% of its revenue from its Industrial segment by supplying chips for factory automation, instrumentation, healthcare, and aerospace applications. As it turns out, this business has been on a tear lately, recording a 20% year-over-year jump in revenue for the second quarter.Investors can expect the industrial business to get even better as Analog Devices see stronger-than-seasonal growth in the ongoing quarter, thanks to the impressive uptake of its industrial solutions after the  acquisition completed earlier this year.This isn't surprising, as Linear is bringing a lot of value for Analog, given its expertise in making high-performance chips for the industrial and automotive markets. As it turns out, the design cycles are longer in these two industries, setting up Analog for long-term growth given the increasing semiconductor demand in these markets.For instance, the industrial-automation market is going to get bigger in the long run as companies try to boost productivity and reduce wastage by implementing real-time analysis in their operations. This can only be achieved by integrating  (IoT) capabilities into the machinery, which requires analog chips made by Analog Devices to process the signals between the devices.IndustryARC pins the size of the factory-automation market at $221 billion in 2021, which is estimated to boost semiconductor demand in this space at a rate of 9.7% a year, as per an evaluation from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Analog Devices, therefore, is sitting on a substantial end-market opportunity that could give a nice push to its revenue in the long run.Image source: Getty Images.Back in 2015, the automotive market consumed $7 billion worth of chips according to Reportlinker's estimates. However, the growing adoption of telematics, connectivity, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) will push up the semiconductor content per vehicle substantially.In fact, automotive semiconductor leader  forecasts that the chip content in each vehicle  to an average of $374 in 2019, creating a $36 billion market opportunity for companies in this space. Analog Devices doesn't want to miss this gravy train, so it has been fast expanding its offerings in this space to grab a bigger share of the pie.Earlier this year, Analog Devices launched a new radar-technology platform based on an advanced node manufacturing process as a part of its Drive360 automotive solution. The company used its existing expertise in ADAS and radar technology to come up with a solution that claims to reduce the time to market for automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), while also lowering development costs.What's more, Analog claims that the solution will give vehicles additional time to take evasive measures, thanks to faster signal processing. Therefore, the company's automotive business could gain stronger traction as its new solution finds its way into more vehicles.Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche avoided the elephant in the room in an interview with  , stating that his company is counting on rapid growth in the industrial and automotive end markets and is not worried much about Apple. It looks like the CEO is sidestepping the concern regarding a potential loss of business at Apple, but Roche wouldn't have made a specific comment on this matter given the potential investor fallout.But investors can get an idea as to where this business is heading by reading between the lines. Apple supplies 12% of Analog Devices' total revenue by using the latter's Force Touch solutions in its iPhones. Analog includes this revenue in its consumer business, which fell 24% sequentially in the second quarter.Roche makes sense when he says that product life cycles in the consumer space are shorter than the other businesses, so there'll be periods of transition when the revenue takes a hit. However, Analog Devices forecasts modest sequential growth in this business during the third quarter, indicating that business might be picking up as Apple starts ramping up iPhone production.Additionally, fellow Fool contributor Ashraf Eassa makes a valid point when he  that Apple is less likely to cut costs for the next iPhone given the premium nature of the device.Analog investors can expect the company to retain its slot at Apple, which could give a strong boost to its financial performance in the latter half of the year, as Cupertino might substantially increase production. This should add to the potential financial gains from the company's automotive and industrial businesses, setting it up for more upside.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), has launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based  by U.S. mobile chipset giant,  . The EC has a 90-working-days' time limit, until Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision.In Oct 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with NXP Semiconductor to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductors share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is likely to close by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.Interestingly, a couple of weeks ago,  reported that Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP Semiconductors have decided to approach the company to renegotiate terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. Notably, NXP Semiconductors had already announced that its shareholders had approved the company's takeover by Qualcomm during an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on Jan 27, 2017.The EC will probe in-depth whether the deal could lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications (NFC).NXP Semiconductors is a leading manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of over $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.The major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is the leader in mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets are gradually slowing down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company's business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP Semiconductors manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will enable Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.Year to date, the stock price of Qualcomm has lost 11.83% compared with 1.75% gain witnessed by the Zacks categorized  industry. The company is widening its presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking and mobile computing strategies, which bode well for long-term growth. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is best known for its versatility in IoT applications.However, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms and anti-competitive charges are some of the major headwinds faced by the company. We believe that these are the reasons behind the company's currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, Analog Devices' latest results and guidance from late May indicate that its Apple account might be intact, setting up the company for solid growth in the second half of the year once iPhone production begins. data by Which company looks like the better Apple play?Image Source: Getty ImagesApple reportedly supplies 12% of Analog Devices' revenue, using the latter's chip to enable 3D Touch in its iPhones. It is unlikely that Apple will skip this feature in its next device, so Analog should retain its spot in the next iPhone.In late May, Analog's revenue guidance range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion for the current quarter turned out to be higher than Wall Street's $1.36 billion estimate, lending credence to the belief that the chipmaker has kept its Apple spot. The retention of its Apple business will be a big deal for Analog Devices as Cupertino is forecast to make 156 million iPhone units in the second half of 2017.But Apple isn't the only reason investors should take a look at Analog Devices, as the company is witnessing rapid growth in its industrial and automotive businesses. The industrial business supplies 46% of the chipmaker's total revenue in the most recent quarter, and it grew 20% year-over-year in the second quarter. The automotive market accounted for15% of sales in the most recent quarter and it was up 9% over the prior year.More importantly, Analog expects the industrial business to outgrow seasonal trends in the current quarter, thanks to the growing demand for its factory automation solutions. Meanwhile, the automotive business is also gaining traction because of the chipmaker's focus on the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) market.Analog's new radar technology product can reduce the time taken by automotive component manufacturers to develop ADAS systems for cars at a lower cost, according to the company, setting it up to tap into the multibillion-dollar opportunity in the automotive chip market.Broadcom reportedly relies on Apple for 20% of its revenue, so it could see more of a boost from increased iPhone production this year as compared to Analog Devices. What's more, Broadcom's gains won't be limited to an increase in the number of iPhones built as the chipmaker expects a 40% jump in content in the next iPhone.Therefore, Broadcom's wireless business looks set for a major boost in the second half of the year after recording 45% year-over-year growth in the second quarter. But there is another catalyst in the form of the enterprise storage business that Broadcom investors shouldn't miss.This business is on a tear as Broadcom's storage system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions are capable of enhancing the storage capacity and density of hard-disk drives (HDDs). This puts the chipmaker right in the middle of the high-capacity storage boom as storage companies are increasingly churning out higher-capacity drives to meet cloud storage demand by data centers.In fact, HDD storage capacity jumped 30% in 2016 though overall shipments were down 9.5%, and the trend is expected to continue as the likes of  move to 20 TB HDD configurations by the end of the decade as compared to the near-term plan of making 14 TB and 16 TB HDDs.Broadcom could witness explosive growth in both the wireless and the storage markets, which together account for 45% of its total revenue.Both Analog Devices and Broadcom have their own set of catalysts, though the latter could deliver stronger upside thanks to its deeper relationship with Apple and the fast-growing nature of the storage market. However, Broadcom looks like a volatile bet as it has thinner margins than Analog Devices, and is more susceptible to any  Apple's supply chain.Meanwhile, Analog Devices' lower reliance on Apple could be a blessing in disguise in case things go south with Cupertino. The chipmaker's fast-growing industrial and automotive businesses seem capable of powering its growth even if it loses its iPhone account.Investors with a higher risk appetite might favor Broadcom, while Analog Devices would better suit more conservative investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Email now to Then log on to Zacks.com and The editors didn't have much to work with in the first two trading days of this short week, but that all changed on Thursday. The ADP employment report blew past expectations by more than 40% as over 250,000 jobs were created last month, which cleared the way for a trifecta of new highs and reinvigorated the portfolios. A solid ISM Manufacturing report also helped.The S&P jumped 0.76% on Thursday to 2430, while the Dow increased 0.65% to 21144.2 and the NASDAQ advanced 0.78% to 6246.8. All were record closes heading into tomorrow's Government Employment Situation report. What a great way to start a new month!The portfolios sprung back into action in the session, with double-digit winners coming from  and  . We saw buys from both of those portfolios as well, along with  ,  ,  and  . Let's get right to the action. With KeyCorp (KEY) rebounding today, Tracey saw a great opportunity to part ways with this weakened bank. But there's nothing weak about its return. She sold KEY on Thursday for a gain of more than 60%. The editor loves the banks for the long term, which is why the portfolio is still holding onto two other stocks from the space.Do you know which space Tracey also likes right now? Beauty retailers…especially if they're in the process of recovering from previous struggles. Sally Beauty (SBH) was added last week, and today she added Coty (COTY) with a 10% allocation. This beauty conglomerate is in the midst of a turnaround as they are repositioning brands like CoverGirl and Max Factor. The Chief Legal Officer and the President of Coty Luxury are feeling pretty good about the plans, as they both picked up shares last week. Several other insiders bought in February and March as well. Read the full commentary for more. John previously said that he was taking some profits on Thursday…and he wasn't kidding! With summer rotations on the horizon, he sold KLA - Tencor (KLAC) and Seagate Tech (STX) today for solid gains of 39.9% and 25.6%, respectively. Regeneron Pharma (REGN) was also sold for a 6% profit. The editor still really likes all these names and may get back into them in the future, but this is a good time to take some profits from the high flyers.At the same time though, it's also a good idea to add companies that will be on the beneficial side of any rotation. YY Inc. (YY) has momentum, valuation and growth, so it could have a good summer. John wants to get ""the Facebook of Mainland China"" up to a standard allocation, so he started today by adding 2% to the original May 24th position. He'll be adding another 2% in a week or two. Read more in the full write-up. If Aaron's (AAN) was  an electronics retailer, then there would be nothing wrong with that since it has a high Zacks Industry Rank. But this company also has a large financing arm that works with many other retailers, and it is this other part of AAN that provided a lot of the fuel for its recent earnings report. Since Steve is such a fan of the U.S. consumer, he sees a lot of potential for this Zacks Rank #1 with a Zacks VGM Score of A. He added it to the portfolio today with a 6.8% allocation with expectations of it easily getting past $40 and maybe even $50 by year's end. Learn more in the complete commentary. Chinese social-networking stocks are hot right now, so Jeremy jumped at the chance to add Momo (MOMO) on Thursday after high-frequency traders dragged the stock to the high $30s despite a strong report. This Zacks Rank #1 slipped all the way into a bullish setup that could catapult the stock past $50. Before that happens, the editor bought a 12% allocation in the name. The complete commentary has a lot more on this new pick. Have you ever looked at stock and wondered to yourself: ""Why don't I own this?!?"" Dave has been thinking just that about Applied Materials (AMAT) for a while now. He's been waiting for this chip equipment company to put in a meaningful pullback…but he's not waiting anymore. The editor put all proceeds from the sale of VECO and the portfolio's remaining cash into an AMAT position on Thursday. Get more specifics in the full write-up. : Just yesterday, the portfolio sold Analog Devices (ADI) for a double-digit profit because Kevin didn't like the stock's reaction to a strong quarter and outlook. On further examination though, it appears the market may be reading too much into the ""sub-seasonal"" description for Q3. After reading the investment bank reports and watching the stock's price targets go up, the editor decided to jump right back into ADI with a 7% allocation. Read the complete commentary for more on this move, including Kevin's review of the analyst conclusions on the possible loss of Apple business.Until Tomorrow,Jim Giaquinto Recommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.

"ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 6/7/17, Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), TELUS Corp. (Symbol: TU), and Waste Management, Inc. (Symbol: WM) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Analog Devices Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.45 on 6/20/17, TELUS Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.4925 on 7/4/17, and Waste Management, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.425 on 6/23/17. As a percentage of ADI's recent stock price of $81.17, this dividend works out to approximately 0.55%, so look for shares of Analog Devices Inc to trade 0.55% lower - all else being equal - when ADI shares open for trading on 6/7/17. Similarly, investors should look for TU to open 1.46% lower in price and for WM to open 0.57% lower, all else being equal.When an S&P 1500 component reaches 20 years of dividend increases, it becomes a contender to join the elite ""Dividend Aristocrats"" index.

Chicago, IL -June 01, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).I used to think that chips were for dips. My thinking has changed. Chips are for rips! The semiconductor space is routinely at the top of the Zacks Industry Rank and the sector has several high double digit winners already this year. Let's take a look at some recent earnings reports from select chip names that might be great additions to your portfolio. (  ) reported a beat on top and on bottom on May 2 and more recently the stock has seen a huge move higher. One of the reasons this stock should be on your radar screen is the heavy volume over the last few days that drove the stock higher. With an average volume of around 550K shares, the last few days saw volumes of 1.2M or more. On 5/31/17 the stock saw roughly average trading volume and slipped 4.5%, but don't be surprised if this under the radar chip play reaches new highs in the coming week.SQNS is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ) reported the morning of 5/31/17 and beat on top and on bottom. The company also raised guidance, and that is just what aggressive growth investors love to see. The stock traded to a new 52 week high of $90.49 but was unable to hold most of the early gains as shares drifted back down to the $86 handle. Look analysts to raise estimates on this stock and for the Zacks Rank to improve in the coming weeks.ADI is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) (  ) is slated to report after the close on Thursday, June 1. Wall Street is looking for revenue of $4.1B and EPS of $3.50. The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and the earnings ESP is a 0% suggesting that the most recent update to estimates is not suggesting a beat is more likely than a miss. The stock has been on a roll since mid-April and given the build for iPhone 8, investors could be expecting some big numbers. At the same time, AVGO trades at only 18.6x forward earnings, which is well below the 23.5x industry average.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

s per a recent report by Bloomberg, U.S. mobile chipset giant,  's  proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant  is facing some disturbances.In Oct 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with NXP Semiconductor to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductors share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.According to the report, Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP Semiconductors have decided to approach the company to renegotiate terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. Notably, NXP Semiconductors already announced that its shareholders have approved the company's takeover by Qualcomm during an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on Jan 27, 2017.NXP Semiconductors is a leading manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is likely to generate annual revenues of over $30 billion. Further, it will position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.The major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is the leader in mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets are gradually slowing down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company's business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP Semiconductors manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will enable Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.Year to date, the stock price of Qualcomm has lost 12.16% compared with 1.43% gain witnessed by the Zacks categorized  industry. Qualcomm, the undisputed leader in the global wireless baseband chipset market is widening its presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking and mobile computing strategies, which bode well for long-term growth. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is best known for its versatility in IoT applications.However, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms and anti-competitive charges are some of the major headwinds faced by the company. We believe that these are the reasons behind the company's currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"he latter half of May was just crazy with stocks moving all over the place. It was two weeks ago today when the major indices plunged by approximately 2% on allegations that President Trump interfered with an FBI investigation. The financial media, along with many politicians, was even wondering aloud what the market would look like if POTUS had to step down.But once everybody cooled off, stocks recovered nicely and embarked on a seven-session winning streak that completely reversed the pullback and ended only yesterday. In the end, the indices each finished the month in the green with the NASDAQ's 2.5% advance leading the way. The S&P was up about 1.2% and the Dow inched forward around 0.3%.But these last two sessions of May have lost the momentum. The S&P was down by 0.05% on Wednesday to 2411.8, though that still marks the fifth straight day ahead of 2400. The Dow was off by only 0.10% to 21008.7 and the NASDAQ slipped 0.08% to 6198.5. There is one adjective for this market that is making the rounds in the portfolios…and the word is ""BORING"".As Jeremy said in  yesterday:  That goes for most of the portfolios so far this week, as the only moves we saw today were sells from  and  (though it should be noted that TAZR saw a double digit winner). The rest of the week may see activity pick up as we get several economic reports, including the big jobs number on Friday. For now, let today's highlights tide you over: Technology and Semis have led the market higher and they've led TAZR Trader to market-beating performance this year. But if the indexes roll over from here, Kevin does not believe these leaders will be spared. In fact, they might have the most excess to correct if a bigger wave of profit-taking takes hold.

"Chicago, IL - May 31, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  )  and  (NASDAQ:  ).If you stayed long shares of  (NASDAQ:  ) after earnings, big congratulations are in order.Unfortunately for me, and my followers, I listened to the crowd of Wall Street investment bank analysts who were neutral-to-bearish on the stock for valuation concerns and I recommended taking our profits near $120, after another solid earnings report on May 9 launched NVDA toward what quickly became all-time highs.After reviewing the company's report and ""show off"" outlook the next day, I immediately knew I had made a mistake -- even though none of the ""i-banks"" with price targets near $100 were ready to admit they had.All I could do -- besides suck it up and pay up to $130 -- was hope the stock would slow down a bit and give us a chance to get back in under $125.Why was I so sure I could pay a 40X EPS multiple for the maker of the hot-selling ""AI"" chips called GPUs -- used in everything from gaming consoles and IBM's Watson to driverless 18-wheelers in Europe and the latest cloud computing customer service and security applications?Because I reasoned that NVIDIA's brand of ""AI"" hardware was going to stay dominant and in demand for several more quarters, if not years. It certainly didn't hurt that the company had planned their hybrid tech conference/investor day on the morning after their May 9 report, at which they revealed further powerful innovations for their specialty processors.To learn more about their GPU chips, see this vlog I made on March 9: A select few i-banks agreed and saw the light early, like Goldman Sachs' semiconductor analyst who raised their price target from $130 to $165 on May 15. And RBC analysts who quickly raised their PT from $138 to $150 on May 11. Bank of America was also in this select group of bulls, raising their PT from $138 to $155 on May 22 after they thought about it for awhile.But I was thinking about it immediately on the night of their report after I saw all the news coming out of ""GPU-Con."" Here's what I told my traders that night...5/10/17TAZR TradersToday's Trade: Sold remaining NVDA shares at $18.75, midpoint of alert price and upper limit of $120.The sale brings us back to 50% cash. And a 12.7% total return for the portfolio since inception January 24.What a day for NVIDIA to also be presenting at the 8th annual GPU Technology Conference (they are the sponsor so it's not a coincidence).I should have known they would WOW the tech crowd. Maybe all those bearish and neutral analysts will be changing their tune soon when they see what's coming.Here was the flurry of 5 fantastic press releases that started coming out after 1pm ET this afternoon...1) NVIDIA Launches Revolutionary Volta GPU Platform, Fueling Next Era of AI and High Performance Computing2) NVIDIA Advances AI Computing Revolution with New Volta-Based DGX Systems3) NVIDIA and Toyota Collaborate to Accelerate Market Introduction of Autonomous Cars4) NVIDIA Ushers in New Era of Robotics, with Breakthroughs Making It Easier to Build and Train Intelligent Machines5) NVIDIA and SAP Partner to Create a New Wave of AI Business ApplicationsThere's something for every Tech lover here!I can't wait to see how many analysts re-work their earnings model for increased sales off any one of these drivers.We may see a few egos swallowed tomorrow and those bearish valuation calls reversed!Looking forward to that!But then it means we probably won't see much profit-taking back to $110.Either way, as I said Monday night after the sale of half of our shares before the Tuesday report...""I hated to do it because I think this rocket will continue to be one of the most explosive Semiconductor companies of this decade.""Truth.If you have time, click on the press release above that most grabs your attention and tool around their site, especially the blog which I've linked to many times because they do such a good job educating about their technology.To wit, they also announced this week...To meet surging demand for expertise in the field of AI, NVIDIA plans to train 100,000 developers this year -- a tenfold increase over 2016 -- through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute.My price target for NVDA by the next earnings call in August was $140.I too may be revising that.(end of 5/10 note to subscribers)And the next day, I kept diving into the unique technology investment story that is NVDA...5/11/17TAZR TradersWell, one analyst on NVDA saw the writing on the wall after the company's GPU conference/investor day.He was already a solid bull, and therefore NOT one of the many ""crow eaters"" I expected -- all with price targets under $100 -- to flip over with a fresh outlook on the leader of AI.The company's 5 news ""reveals"" yesterday definitely gave any one of them ""cover"" to reverse. They will, soon enough.But even our bull sounded a little reluctant...NVIDIA PT Raised to $150 at RBC Capital Following Analyst Day noting strength of 'Gross Margins, Data Center & A.I.'RBC Capital raised its price target on NVIDIA to $150 from $138 while maintaining a Outperform rating, following the company presentations on Wednesday.Analyst Mitch Steves suggested a more positive outlook on NVDA shares following the company's analyst day, noting improved confidence around Data Center growth, while AI remains a big, upside focus for management. Steves was also impressed by the growth potential in e-Sports.For my part, NVIDIA is still one to own for the future of business and industrial automation. I'm adding it as #5 to my list of 4 stocks I picked last June in this area: AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and IBM (see my link below for more on that story).And from the volume buying today by institutions, other than those who were short, it's pretty clear this one is not headed back to $110 any time soon.Yes, there was a fair amount of chasing from the retail crowd who regret missing this rocket to the future.But funds can buy and hold it here with no shame or regret even if it does go down to $110.They can say ""Now we get it. NVDA is the future of AI in the cloud, in factories, and on the road.""My only question is...Speaking of our highly-automated and ""augmented intelligence"" future around the next corner or decade, check out the podcast I did Tuesday where I connected my June 2016 Zacks Confidential report on ""Big Economic Disruption: Big Data, AI, and Robotics"" with an exciting new scholar who has some radical ideas about what the rich will do with ""cyborg"" type technologies -- and what will happen to the rest of society when ""jobs"" are much more scarce...(end of 5/11 note to subscribers)There are 4 important groups of buyers of NVDA stock on this move from below $130 to $145:1. The shorts. Poor, misguided bears who might have covered at $120, only to be tempted to re-short every $5 higher. They keep chasing their losses higher.2. The retail crowd. I can't blame them for loving this story. Every computer nerd and gaming geek who knows what a GPU is telling their family and friends to ""Buy NVDA!"" It's a dream come true for them to see such a chip stock back on the ""Hot & Sexy"" list of most active shares.3. SoftBank. The Japanese tech investment conglomerate quietly amassed a $4B stake in Nvidia recently, making it the fourth-largest shareholder in the graphics chipmaker, according to Bloomberg.The company disclosed the possible stake as it announced $93 billion of commitments to its technology investment arm, Vision Fund, but did not specify the size of the stake, Bloomberg wrote. Under U.S. SEC rules, a stake of 5% would require a regulatory disclosure but a holding of just 4.9% would be worth about $4 billion.The holdings fit with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's plans to become the biggest investor in technology over the next decade, with bets on emerging trends such as artificial intelligence.Two days later, ""sources close to the matter"" revealed that SoftBank was interested in further increasing its investment in the GPU design company. Although no specifics were given, the purported increase would happen over time as SoftBank begins to work closely with Nvidia.4. Banks and funds reversing course. This is the real money that moves the markets, as evidenced by the commitment of Softbank and the market response since May 24. Bank analysts who provide research to Wall Street's largest mutual and hedge funds are due to capitulate their ""over-valued"" calls on NVDA and simply admit that it deserves a higher multiple. This will also bring more funds into the stock, which is part of what you see happening now.Just like me, there are probably dozens of fund managers now saying what I thought they might on May 11 when I proposed...They can say ""Now we get it. NVDA is the future of AI in the cloud, in factories, and on the road.""So, am I buying NVDA up here in nose-bleed territory at 43X next year's consensus EPS estimate of $3.39? Nope. Can't do it.But I'm waiting to buy it between 38X and 40X. And with such a chase going on these past few weeks, there are plenty of weak hands who will get flushed out on the first piece of bad news.It will have to be something negative and slightly unexpected -- a product failure/recall, a production glitch, a lost customer, etc. And the stock could gap down $10 on the news.But that's when you buy. Barring a bigger market correction -- and who knows when that will ever come again -- it may be your only shot to get back in NVDA.I'm ready.In other semiconductor news,  (NASDAQ:  )  saw its price target raised to $170 from $155 at Deutsche Bank today. Analyst Sidney Ho said LRCX shares are positioned to continue outperforming in the second half of 2017 despite rallying 45% year-to-date. The WFE (wafer fabrication equipment) market is set to reach a record $40 billion in 2017 and could grow another 5% in 2018, the analyst contends.

Earnings and surges through round numbered support are the theme of today's three big stock charts as  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) are three names that are offering bullish opportunities based on their price movement and charts. (NASDAQ:  ) supplier Analog Devices came out with a great earnings report. The company beat on the top and bottom line as well as providing an upgraded outlook.Analog Devices shares of the semiconductor stock are surging higher into a volatility rally this morning as a result of the catalyst. In early morning trading, ADI has shattered through $85, which had been chart resistance for the stock.The move also surges Analog Devices shares into an overbought reading of the RSI, but this is one of those situations where overbought will become more overbought as the market is going to load-up on ADI shares. A similar situation happened with  (NASDAQ:  ) shares after their earnings this quarter.Analog Devices saw a 26% increase in short interest just ahead of the report, so there are going to be a lot of short sellers entering the market to cover their losses quickly. This will help to propel Analog Devices stock even higher.The stock's next technical target is $100, where it will start working on moving into new all-time high territory.Will it or won't it? That's the question that market-watchers are asking about Amazon.com shares breaking above $1,000.AMZN stock has been doing a dance just below the $1,000 mark for the last four trading sessions. This is a perfect example of how round-numbers tend to act as resistance and support. The more the zeros, the more impact.Amazon stock is toying around with breaking above the top Bollinger Band at the same time that we're going to see a break above $1,000. This combination will have a bullish volatility affect that is likely to see AMZN stock surge higher in a fast and aggressive motion.Our charts expect to see a 5-10% rally after the break above $1,000, followed by a pullback to the same price level as a technical test. In other words, this chart reads like a trader's dream.It makes sense. More discretionary income also comes with less time for fun, so we order pizza to save time, right? So when I see that Domino's Pizza stock is benefiting from improving from stronger fundamentals it just makes sense.DPZ stock is surging as it has now broken through $200 and it trading above its top Bollinger Band. This trend has been supported by Wall Street analysts getting into the stock as a whopping 78% of the analysts have been camping out in the hold category. Now we're seeing interest in Domino's Pizza stock change, which means a migration of cash is on its way as upgrades drive investors to the shares.Over the intermediate-term, we expect to see a $225-print on DPZ shares, followed by some profit-taking on the stock that will likely re-test the $200-level.

 used to think that chips were for dips. My thinking has changed. Chips are for rips! The semi conductor space is routinely at the top of the Zacks Industry Rank and the sector has several high double digit winners already this year. Let's take a look at some recent earnings reports from select chip names that might be great additions to your portfolio. (SQNS) reported a beat on top and on bottom on May 2 and more recently the stock has seen a huge move higher. One of the reasons this stock should be on your radar screen is the heavy volume over the last few days that drove the stock higher. With an average volume of around 550K shares, the last few days saw volumes of 1.2M or more. On 5/31/17 the stock saw roughly average trading volume and slipped 4.5%, but don't be surprised if this under the radar chip play reaches new highs in the coming week.SQNS is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) |  (ADI) reported the morning of 5/31/17 and beat on top and on bottom. The company also raised guidance, and that is just what aggressive growth investors love to see. The stock traded to a new 52 week high of $90.49 but was unable to hold most of the early gains as shares drifted back down to the $86 handle. Look analysts to raise estimates on this stock and for the Zacks Rank to improve in the coming weeks.ADI is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) |  (AVGO) is slated to report after the close on Thursday, June 1. Wall Street is looking for revenue of $4.1B and EPS of $3.50. The stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and the earnings ESP is a 0% suggesting that the most recent update to estimates is not suggesting a beat is more likely than a miss. The stock has been on a roll since mid April and given the build for iPhone 8, investors could be expecting some big numbers. At the same time, AVGO trades at only 18.6x forward earnings, which is well below the 23.5x industry average. | Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

"f you stayed long shares of  after earnings, big congratulations are in order.Unfortunately for me, and my followers, I listened to the crowd of Wall Street investment bank analysts who were neutral-to-bearish on the stock for valuation concerns and I recommended taking our profits near $120, after another solid earnings report on May 9 launched NVDA toward what quickly became all-time highs.After reviewing the company's report and ""show off"" outlook the next day, I immediately knew I had made a mistake -- even though none of the ""i-banks"" with price targets near $100 were ready to admit they had.All I could do -- besides suck it up and pay up to $130 -- was hope the stock would slow down a bit and give us a chance to get back in under $125.Why was I so sure I could pay a 40X EPS multiple for the maker of the hot-selling ""AI"" chips called GPUs -- used in everything from gaming consoles and IBM's Watson to driverless 18-wheelers in Europe and the latest cloud computing customer service and security applications?Because I reasoned that NVIDIA's brand of ""AI"" hardware was going to stay dominant and in demand for several more quarters, if not years. It certainly didn't hurt that the company had planned their hybrid tech conference/investor day on the morning after their May 9 report, at which they revealed further powerful innovations for their specialty processors.To learn more about their GPU chips, see this vlog I made on March 9: A select few i-banks agreed and saw the light early, like Goldman Sachs' semiconductor analyst who raised their price target from $130 to $165 on May 15. And RBC analysts who quickly raised their PT from $138 to $150 on May 11. Bank of America was also in this select group of bulls, raising their PT from $138 to $155 on May 22 after they thought about it for awhile.But I was thinking about it immediately on the night of their report after I saw all the news coming out of ""GPU-Con."" Here's what I told my traders that night...5/10/17TAZR TradersToday's Trade: Sold remaining NVDA shares at $18.75, midpoint of alert price and upper limit of $120.The sale brings us back to 50% cash. And a 12.7% total return for the portfolio since inception January 24.What a day for NVIDIA to also be presenting at the 8th annual GPU Technology Conference (they are the sponsor so it's not a coincidence).I should have known they would WOW the tech crowd. Maybe all those bearish and neutral analysts will be changing their tune soon when they see what's coming.Here was the flurry of 5 fantastic press releases that started coming out after 1pm ET this afternoon...1) NVIDIA Launches Revolutionary Volta GPU Platform, Fueling Next Era of AI and High Performance Computing2) NVIDIA Advances AI Computing Revolution with New Volta-Based DGX Systems3) NVIDIA and Toyota Collaborate to Accelerate Market Introduction of Autonomous Cars4) NVIDIA Ushers in New Era of Robotics, with Breakthroughs Making It Easier to Build and Train Intelligent Machines5) NVIDIA and SAP Partner to Create a New Wave of AI Business ApplicationsThere's something for every Tech lover here!I can't wait to see how many analysts re-work their earnings model for increased sales off any one of these drivers.We may see a few egos swallowed tomorrow and those bearish valuation calls reversed!Looking forward to that!But then it means we probably won't see much profit-taking back to $110.Either way, as I said Monday night after the sale of half of our shares before the Tuesday report...""I hated to do it because I think this rocket will continue to be one of the most explosive Semiconductor companies of this decade.""Truth.If you have time, click on the press release above that most grabs your attention and tool around their site, especially the blog which I've linked to many times because they do such a good job educating about their technology.To wit, they also announced this week...To meet surging demand for expertise in the field of AI, NVIDIA plans to train 100,000 developers this year -- a tenfold increase over 2016 -- through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute.My price target for NVDA by the next  in August was $140.I too may be revising that.(end of 5/10 note to subscribers)And the next day, I kept diving into the unique technology investment story that is NVDA...5/11/17TAZR TradersWell, one analyst on NVDA saw the writing on the wall after the company's GPU conference/investor day.He was already a solid bull, and therefore NOT one of the many ""crow eaters"" I expected -- all with price targets under $100 -- to flip over with a fresh outlook on the leader of AI.The company's 5 news ""reveals"" yesterday definitely gave any one of them ""cover"" to reverse. They will, soon enough.But even our bull sounded a little reluctant...NVIDIA PT Raised to $150 at RBC Capital Following Analyst Day noting strength of 'Gross Margins, Data Center & A.I.'RBC Capital raised its price target on NVIDIA to $150 from $138 while maintaining a Outperform rating, following the company presentations on Wednesday.Analyst Mitch Steves suggested a more positive outlook on NVDA shares following the company's analyst day, noting improved confidence around Data Center growth, while AI remains a big, upside focus for management. Steves was also impressed by the growth potential in e-Sports.For my part, NVIDIA is still one to own for the future of business and industrial automation. I'm adding it as #5 to my list of 4 stocks I picked last June in this area: AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, and IBM (see my link below for more on that story).And from the volume buying today by institutions, other than those who were short, it's pretty clear this one is not headed back to $110 any time soon.Yes, there was a fair amount of chasing from the retail crowd who regret missing this rocket to the future.But funds can buy and hold it here with no shame or regret even if it does go down to $110.They can say ""Now we get it. NVDA is the future of AI in the cloud, in factories, and on the road.""My only question is...Speaking of our highly-automated and ""augmented intelligence"" future around the next corner or decade, check out the podcast I did Tuesday where I connected my June 2016 Zacks Confidential report on ""Big Economic Disruption: Big Data, AI, and Robotics"" with an exciting new scholar who has some radical ideas about what the rich will do with ""cyborg"" type technologies -- and what will happen to the rest of society when ""jobs"" are much more scarce...(end of 5/11 note to subscribers)There are 4 important groups of buyers of NVDA stock on this move from below $130 to $145:1. The shorts. Poor, misguided bears who might have covered at $120, only to be tempted to re-short every $5 higher. They keep chasing their losses higher.2. The retail crowd. I can't blame them for loving this story. Every computer nerd and gaming geek who knows what a GPU is telling their family and friends to ""Buy NVDA!"" It's a dream come true for them to see such a chip stock back on the ""Hot & Sexy"" list of most active shares.3. SoftBank. The Japanese tech investment conglomerate quietly amassed a $4B stake in Nvidia recently, making it the fourth-largest shareholder in the graphics chipmaker, according to Bloomberg.The company disclosed the possible stake as it announced $93 billion of commitments to its technology investment arm, Vision Fund, but did not specify the size of the stake, Bloomberg wrote. Under U.S. SEC rules, a stake of 5% would require a regulatory disclosure but a holding of just 4.9% would be worth about $4 billion.The holdings fit with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's plans to become the biggest investor in technology over the next decade, with bets on emerging trends such as artificial intelligence.Two days later, ""sources close to the matter"" revealed that SoftBank was interested in further increasing its investment in the GPU design company. Although no specifics were given, the purported increase would happen over time as SoftBank begins to work closely with Nvidia.4. Banks and funds reversing course. This is the real money that moves the markets, as evidenced by the commitment of Softbank and the market response since May 24. Bank analysts who provide research to Wall Street's largest mutual and hedge funds are due to capitulate their ""over-valued"" calls on NVDA and simply admit that it deserves a higher multiple. This will also bring more funds into the stock, which is part of what you see happening now.Just like me, there are probably dozens of fund managers now saying what I thought they might on May 11 when I proposed...They can say ""Now we get it. NVDA is the future of AI in the cloud, in factories, and on the road.""So, am I buying NVDA up here in nose-bleed territory at 43X next year's consensus EPS estimate of $3.39? Nope. Can't do it.But I'm waiting to buy it between 38X and 40X. And with such a chase going on these past few weeks, there are plenty of weak hands who will get flushed out on the first piece of bad news.It will have to be something negative and slightly unexpected -- a product failure/recall, a production glitch, a lost customer, etc. And the stock could gap down $10 on the news.But that's when you buy. Barring a bigger market correction -- and who knows when that will ever come again -- it may be your only shot to get back in NVDA.I'm ready.In other semiconductor news,  saw its price target raised to $170 from $155 at Deutsche Bank today. Analyst Sidney Ho said LRCX shares are positioned to continue outperforming in the second half of 2017 despite rallying 45% year-to-date. The WFE (wafer fabrication equipment) market is set to reach a record $40 billion in 2017 and could grow another 5% in 2018, the analyst contends. Lam remains his favorite name in Semicap Equipment.Also, I'm eagerly waiting for  to report their Q2 results Wednesday morning before the market opens. We bought this terrific tech sales and earnings grower with a sub-2.0 PEG ratio last month when concerns were brewing they might lose their Apple (AAPL) iPhone business. Shares are making new all-time highs today over $84 as I type.Disclosure: I own shares of LRCX and ADI for the Zacks TAZR Trader.Most of Zacks' investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

hares of  (NASDAQ: AAPL) supplier  (NASDAQ: ADI) have done well this year despite rumors that Apple might drop its chips from the next iPhone. Last month, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a research note (via  ) that the chipmaker could lose its Force Touch socket in Apple's upcoming iPhone due to cost cuts. Though others doubt this and Analog Devices investors are apparently not worried as the stock is currently trading close to its 52-week highs after logging 13% gains so far in 2017. What should investors expect when Analog Devices releases its second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 31?Image Source: Analog DevicesWall Street expects Analog Devices' revenue to rise 41% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, which is significantly higher than the $910 million midpoint of the company's own guidance given in mid-February. But Analog should meet analyst expectations thanks to the Linear Technology acquisition that was completed in March.The Linear Technology acquisition is expected to contribute between $160 million and $170 million in revenue during the second quarter. But the interesting thing to note is that Analog is on track to achieve strong double-digit organic revenue growth as its factory automation, automotive, and consumer businesses are gaining robust traction.What's more, the terrific year-over-year jump in Analog Devices' revenue is estimated by analysts to push its earnings to $0.84 per share as compared to $0.64 per share in the prior-year period. But investors will be more concerned with the company's outlook as it will provide concrete signs regarding its Apple relationship.Analog Devices reportedly gets 12% of its overall revenue from Apple by supplying the Force Touch solution for iPhones. So, a potential loss of content at its biggest customer would definitely hurt its top line. But not everyone is convinced Analog Devices will lose out.Fool contributor Ashraf Eassa, for instance,  Analog Devices should retain its spot in the next iPhone given that Apple is going all out to pack the next iPhone with cutting-edge features. And analysts expect Cupertino to charge a heavy premium for the next iPhone.For instance,  believes that pricing will start at $870 and could go all the way up to $1,070, thanks to features such as wireless charging and an edge-to-edge screen. This indicates Analog Devices shouldn't lose its spot due to cost concerns as Apple allegedly plans a high price and won't want to exclude a popular feature.A design win in a higher-priced iPhone that some expect to ship 130 million units in 2017 would be a big deal for Analog Devices. But Apple isn't the only catalyst that Analog Devices investors should be looking out for as the company's automotive and industrial businesses are growing at a fast clip.Industrial is Analog Devices' biggest end market, with 41% of total revenue, and it is getting better thanks to the growing demand for factory automation solutions. In fact, Analog's factory automation sales jumped 15% during the first quarter, and it is likely that the trend will continue as this market could grow at 6.6% a year until 2024, according to  h.Meanwhile, Analog Devices is attacking the self-driving car opportunity with its Drive360 autonomous driving product. The company is primarily focusing on radar solutions that are crucial to the operation of driverless cars, so it is not surprising to see its automotive revenue increased 10% year-over-year during the first quarter and now accounts for 14% of the total.Investors, shouldn't be surprised if Analog Devices' outlook turns out to be stronger-than-expected thanks to a possible Apple boost and secular growth in the automotive and industrial markets.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Analog Devices (  ) will report its fiscal second-quarter numbers before the market open on May 31. Analysts forecast earnings of $0.85 per share, up from $0.64 during the same period last year. ADI shares have risen 14.0% on the year.ADI was recently trading at $82.62, down $1.62 from its 12-month high and just $30.45 above its 12-month low. Technical indicators for ADI are bullish and the stock is in a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $78.35, and is trading above recent resistance. Of the 19 analysts who cover the stock, 12 rate it a ""strong buy"", two rate it a ""buy"" and five rate it a ""hold"". The stock receives S&P Capital IQ's 4 STARS ""Buy"" ranking.Analog Devices has an outstanding earnings track record. The company has posted better than expected profits for 10 straight quarters, and estimate topping sales for the last 13 quarters. The consensus calls for quarterly earnings of $0.85, which would mark a 32.8% year over year increase, but the street expects even more from the company, with a whisper number of $0.88 for the quarter. Given the company's history of posting higher than expected quarterly profits, there is a good chance that it will be able to hit its whisper number, which would allow the stock to build on its recent gains, and continue trending higher through the summer. The stock has a P/E of 28.1, which is a bit high, but if the company is able to grow earnings by 32% year over year for the recent quarter, and 30.6% for the full year as analysts forecast, there is no reason to believe the stock has exhausted its upside potential.If you are looking for a bullish hedged option trade on ADI, consider a September 65/70 bull-put credit spread for a 50-cent credit. That's a potential 11.1% return (36.2% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 14.7% to cause a problem.If you are looking for a bearish hedged option trade on ADI, consider a September 90/92.50 bear-call credit spread for a 40-cent credit. That's a potential 19.0% return (62.1% annualized*) and the stock would have to climb 9.4% to cause a problem.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analog Devices reports fiscal Q2 earnings May 31@2017-05-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-reports-fiscal-q2-earnings-may-31-2017-05-27
 , one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits, will report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 31, before the bell.The company's earnings surprise history has been impressive as it has surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive beat of 14.14%.Shares of Analog Devices have outperformed the Zacks  industry over the last one year. The stock returned 41.7% while the industry gained 36.9%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices has completed the acquisition of Linear Technology. The merger of these two companies is expected to create an analog industry leader across a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale.The deal will significantly expand Analog Devices' total addressable market allowing it to cater to phenomenal demand in some of the most attractive markets such as industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to the company's revenues in the soon-to-reported quarter. Analog Devices expects the deal to add revenues between $160 and $170 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This guidance includes a reduction of approximately $30 million related to a purchase accounting adjustment for Linear's North America distributor deferred revenues.Also, the company expects its non-GAAP interest and other interest expense to be approximately $60 million in the second quarter, $70 million in the third quarter and $60 million every quarter thereafter.Analog Devices has been benefitting from strength across all the markets - industrial, automotive, consumer and communications, and increased focus on innovation and operational execution. While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.For the second quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $870 million to $950 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 66.5% to 67.0%. Operating expenses are expected to be down 3% to up 1%. The company expects interest and other expense of approximately $30 million, tax rate of approximately 8% and earnings per share in the range of 74-86 cents. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 85 cents. Therefore, the Earnings ESP for the stock is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Teradyne, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see Lam Research Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.66% and a Zacks Rank #1.DST Systems, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.64% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's investment ideas are short-term, directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator.

The bounce from Wednesday's selling spree continues suggesting that the market may have simply overreacted to the political headlines - shocker! As we mentioned  , the dip in prices may prove to be nothing more than an opportunity to buy a dip.Continuing on that theme, today's three big stock charts look at shares of  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ), all of which are showing further potential for upside based on their charts.Alibaba took a big dip after their earnings on Thursday, generating an opportunity for investors to grab this market-leader after it has reloaded for another climb higher.BABA shares of the online retailer almost touched-down on their 50-day moving average on Thursday, close enough for the technical traders to jump on the bullish bandwagon, which really isn't a bandwagon at all.According to our data, Alibaba short sellers had been loading-up on bearish bets ahead of the announcement, indicating that a short covering rally was likely to move the stock higher. In BABA's case, the dramatic selloff followed by support from the short-term selloff triggering the covering rally.From here, shares of Alibaba are getting a lift from breaking above the $125-level as the shorts cover and the analyst tout the upside potential.One of the industrial names that has been caught in the political turmoil is McKesson Corporation. MCK stock headed into its earnings announcement trading with some increased volatility and trading into resistance at the stock's 50- and 100-day moving averages.This morning's post-earnings move takes McKesson stock above this resistance at the same time that it ascends above the longer-term 200-day moving average. This is an incredibly bullish move that will attract technical traders to the name.From a fundamental perspective, MCK will benefit from infrastructure spending, regardless of what happens with the current administration. This is the fundamental driver behind the stock's move.McKesson stock's 50- and 100-day moving averages were in the process of shifting into a bullish outlook as both are beginning to trend higher. Today's move will conform and strengthen that outlook. The technical target based from the chart is $170 over the short-term.Some of the larger semiconductor stocks have had a rough go lately, but the smaller companies are gaining strength. Analog Devices is among the latter as the stock is trading 12% higher year-to-date and 46% higher over the last 12 months.ADI stock is spending the day making a move above its 50-day moving average, which is a bullish development.In addition, Analog Devices' 50-day is trading just above the 100-day, a sign that the intermediate-term outlook is strengthening. One more shift in the stock's trends that attracts the technical buyers right now is the fact that the 50-day moving average is transitioning into an ascending pattern. Based on our historical testing, this doubles the chance that ADI stock will continue its rally to a 2:1 probability.Analog Devices will face some chart resistance as it heads towards $84 as this is where we saw shares top out in March. In addition, ADI shares will be approaching a technically overbought reading at this price as well.With momentum building, the stock is more likely to continue its trend this time around with a price target of $90.The post ), McKesson Corporation () and Analog Devices, Inc.

 and Analog Devices, Inc.  have teamed up for scalable Silicon Carbide (SiC) driver reference design solution.The new product is based on a range of Microsemi SiC MOSFET products and Analog Devices' ADuM4135 5KV isolated gate driver. Microsemi claimed that with the new SiC driver solution, customers can now choose the best driver and components and can also scale to their particular MOSFET requirements.The program includes leading silicon, intellectual property (IP), software, systems and design experts collaborate on technology, sales and marketing efforts. The program aims at decreasing time to market for end customers and time to revenue for ecosystem participants. | We believe that participation and contribution from Analog Devices to this ecosystem would enable easier access for Microsemi customers by speeding up time to market. In addition, it could boost Microsemi's efforts to improve product mix and operational efficiency.We believe strategic positioning, strong fundamentals and efficient execution have been helping Microsemi outperform the  industry. Over the last year, while the stock rallied 48.9%, the industry gained 39%.As far as Analog Devices is concerned, we believe placing one of its isolated gate drivers in the new design solution is part of its efforts to boost the Power Management & Reference product category.Notably, the new product is suitable for a range of end markets such as defense, aerospace, industrial automotive and medical. As both the companies serve common markets such as industrial and automotive, the new move looks like a joint effort to serve the respective markets.According to research firm Yole Développement, the SiC power market is anticipated to witness compound annual growth rate of 19% and cross the $550 million mark in 2021.The strong growth projection should be encouraging for the likes of Microsemi.

"Chicago, IL - April 28, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Much has been said about semiconductor stocks lately, with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued. Neither position can be completely ruled out. But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential.And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank, which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group (sub-industry) that it's in. In fact, Zacks studies have shown that the top 50% of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.So today, we are going to take a closer look at the  , which is in the top 10% of Zacks-ranked industries.The group has slightly outperformed the S&P 500, having appreciated 5.5% compared to the 4.8% for the S&P 500.Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high (up 31.4%). Gross profit (up 26.3% in 2016) and net income before non-recurring items (up 16.4%) show similar trends. However, the industry is investing heavily in R&D and SG&A (up 65.0% in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years) and unlike in the past, it's tapping into the debt market to do it (interest expenses are up 134.5% in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years.A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter. Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014. Net income before non-recurring items has risen since Mar 2016. As with the annual trend, the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend (using depreciation as a proxy), as well as rising interest rates.If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, IoT, industrial and medical technology, drones (the list is almost never-ending), it's clear that this is a growth segment. So while momentum trading opportunities may be there in some cases, they may not be what value buyers are looking for.So with that let's jump to the picks for today- (NASDAQ:  )Analog Devices, Inc. is one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal processing applications. The technology is found in communications, cellular telephones, computers and computer peripherals, consumer electronics, automotive electronics, factory automation, process control and military and space systems.Investment factors:Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (You can see  .)Growth Score B-Revenue, gross profit and earnings before non-recurring items have improved over the past year while opex and interest expenses have shot up-Earnings and revenues beat estimates in the last seven quarters, price reaction to earnings reports hasn't always been positive-Earnings estimates have increased significantly over the last 60 days-The balance sheet debt has soared in the last six quarters, taking the debt cap ratio from 14.7% to 41.8%.

imilar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  , which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in FLEX.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 2 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.16 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.07.Also, for the current quarter, Flex has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 23 cents a share from 25 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 7.2% in the past month. | So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Computer and Technology sector, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Analog Devices, Inc.  . The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and may be a better selection at this time.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

uch has been said about semiconductor stocks lately, with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued. Neither position can be completely ruled out. But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential.And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank, which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group (sub-industry) that it's in. In fact, Zacks studies have shown that the top 50% of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.So today, we are going to take a closer look at the  , which is in the top 10% of Zacks-ranked industries.The group has slightly outperformed the S&P 500, having appreciated 5.5% compared to the 4.8% for the S&P 500.Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high (up 31.4%). Gross profit (up 26.3% in 2016) and net income before non-recurring items (up 16.4%) show similar trends. However, the industry is investing heavily in R&D and SG&A (up 65.0% in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years) and unlike in the past, it's tapping into the debt market to do it (interest expenses are up 134.5% in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years.A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter. Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014. Net income before non-recurring items has risen since Mar 2016. As with the annual trend, the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend (using depreciation as a proxy), as well as rising interest rates.If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, IoT, industrial and medical technology, drones (the list is almost never-ending), it's clear that this is a growth segment. So while momentum trading opportunities may be there in some cases, they may not be what value buyers are looking for.MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation is a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products for high-volume consumer applications.

rowth at a reasonable price, or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive growth prospects but are trading at a discount. Unlike the blend strategy, a portfolio created on the GARP way of investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof. (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.) (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.) (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.) (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only four.Here are the stocks that made it through the screen:Headquartered in Norwood, MA,  is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 14.1% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

"ere we are in the thick of earnings season, but most of the big reports didn't happen until after Thursday's bell. Tech giants Amazon and Google had some great results, while we also heard from Microsoft and Intel. The excitement over these reports was enough to separate the NASDAQ from its counterparts, as the index reached a record high.The NASDAQ was up 0.39% to 6048.9, while the S&P could only manage a 0.06% advance to 2388.8 and the Dow inched higher 0.03% to 20,981.3. Tomorrow should be interesting as the market will get a chance to react to these tech reports, though the Q1 GDP will also be released on Friday and some are not expecting it to be very pretty.In the portfolios, the new  added two more positions, bringing the stable up to 10 names this week. The editor plans to add between 20-25 in total. There was also a triple-digit winner for  and a double-digit winner for  . The former portfolio also bought today, along with  ,  and  . Learn all about it below: The first week of this new service rolls on with two more buys on Thursday. Kevin really likes the recent pullback in Regeneron (REGN) because he believes this approximately $360 company is destined to breakthrough $400 and then some in the long run. The company makes therapies for diseases of the eye, gout and cancers. It reports on May 4.The other buy is managed care provider Centene (CNC), which has already reported and delivered a strong performance earlier this week. The company has Zacks Style Scores of A across the board, and Kevin believes it will continue to expand into new service areas, acquisitions and healthcare reform initiatives. Read the full write-up for more on these new additions, along with updates on the other 8 stocks that were added this week. The portfolio's bull call spread in Mohawk Industries (MHK) has already made more than 95% of its maximum profit potential. Kevin doesn't think it's worth holding this spread into the company's report after the close today, since he could lose most of that gain on a disappointing performance. So he removed the spread on Thursday and banked an impressive 150% profit.Kevin also bought to open a Sept. 75.00 Call in Centene (CNC), a Zacks Rank #2 managed care provider. Following positive surprises on both the top and bottom lines, the stock looks like its finally ready to breakout to the upside after several years of consolidation. The editor also likes that the stock's P/S ratio is under 1.0 at 0.28. Learn more in the complete write-up. Insperity (NSP) is scheduled to report on Monday, so Steve felt it was wise to sell a few shares of this staffing company since you never know what earnings season will bring. The sale banked a gain of 13.4% and leaves the portfolio with a 6.8% allocation. For the same reason, the editor sold some of Royal Caribbean (RCL) ahead of its report tomorrow for a return of 7.2%. The portfolio still has a 7.1% allocation in the name. Read the full write-up for more on all of today's moves. After retreating to the 50-day, shares of Ultratech (UTEK) have since broken higher on volume to fresh 52-week highs. That's exactly what Dave wants to see, so he added UTEK to the portfolio on Thursday with a 12.5% allocation. Also today, the editor got out of his ""stale"" Scientific Games (SGMS) position after it slipped to a Zacks Rank #3, but the stock still brought a solid gain of 9.7%. Read the full write-up for a lot more on these positions, including a breakdown of UTEK's chart. Shares of Huntsman Corp. (HUN) advanced after the chemical products company reported a strong quarter yesterday morning, which included a positive surprise of 50% and a raised FY17 guidance. But then the HFTs got involved and pulled the stock lower. Jeremy thinks that HUN will get back to Wednesday's highs and more, so he bought an 8% allocation in the company on Thursday.And it's the same idea with toy giant Hasbro (HAS), which had a 16% positive surprise in its recent quarterly announcement. HFTs may succeed in driving this Zacks Rank #1 beneath $100 in the short run, but the editor believes it will recover to the $106-$110 area within a month. Therefore, he added HAS with an 11% allocation. Get a lot more info on both of these additions in the complete commentary. Kevin was waiting to buy Analog Devices (ADI) under $77. However, this market isn't going down right now, so the editor decided that under $78 was close enough. He bought ADI on Thursday with a 7% allocation.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. After I gathered the core events in this Global Week Ahead, I concluded this:Any earnings surprise -- these can pop up after any individual release -- can firmly re-set the overall trader tone on the S&P 500 index.The most provocative top-down thesis may be this: Consensus says global sectors, not domestic sectors, lead the U.S. earnings growth rate higher.Let's cover three major regions in turn.In the Global Week Ahead, the U.S. earnings season ramps up.Overall, consensus pegs S&P 500 Q1 earnings growth at +9.2% y/y. S&P 500 companies with higher global revenue exposure should outperform more domestic focused outfits.At the sector level, in Q1, the Info Tech and Energy sector should be the largest contributors to earnings and revenue growth. Those sectors capture the most global demand.In the diplomatic space, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence has begun a four-country Asia tour by visiting South Korea.On Tuesday, Vice President Pence has set a first round of U.S.-Japan talks on trade and the economy in Tokyo with Finance Minister Taro Aso. Officials should release a statement with a timetable for future discussions.On Thursday, fresh Brazilian inflation numbers come out.These will assist global financial markets in setting consensus on the direction and pace of future Brazil rates. Last week, Banco Central do Brasil (the central bank of Brazil) cut its SELIC policy rate by 100 basis points to 11.25%.

" posted first-quarter 2017 reported earnings of 18 cents per share that doubled on a year-over-year basis. However, the figure declined from 26 cents reported in the previous quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 26 cents per share.Moreover, ON Semi reported non-GAAP revenues of $1.28 billion, which surged 56.8% from the year-ago quarter and 1.6% from the previous quarter. The figure was better than management's guided range of $1.215-$1.265 billion. | The year-over-year growth was driven by strong progress of the Fairchild integration and improving automotive, industrial and communications end-markets.We note that ON Semi has outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog & Mixed industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock gained 13.1% as compared with industry's 9.6%. The company's diversified product and customer base along with improving end-markets will aid the stock sustain momentum in the rest of 2017.ON Semi has three business units namely - Power Solutions Group or PSG (revenues of $636 million), Analog Solutions (revenues of $462 million) and Image Sensor Group (revenues of $184 million).Automotive (32% of revenues) end-market revenues were approximately $405 million, up 28% year over year and almost 10% quarter over quarter. In the quarter, the company's image sensor revenues related to advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and viewing applications grew at an impressive high-teen percentage rate sequentially.Management noted that growth drivers for automotive applications include LED lighting, power management, power discretes, body electronics, in-vehicle networking solutions and powertrain ASICs.Industrial (25%) end-market revenues increased 64% year over year and 6% sequentially to $320 million. The company noted that its Python line of CMOS image sensors for machine vision applications continues to grow at an impressive rate.Communications (19%) end-market revenues grew 75% year over year but declined almost 14% quarter over quarter to $243 million, due to seasonality and softness in the Chinese handset market.Computing (10%) grew 70% year over year and 1% quarter over quarter to $130 million. On Semi won designs for power stage for cloud computing and server applications. The company anticipates revenues from these wins to start contributing in the near-to-mid-term.Consumer (14%) end-market revenues almost doubled on a year-over-year basis and grew approximately 1% sequentially to $184 million.Non GAAP gross margin was 35.4%, up 30 basis points (bps) sequentially and 170 bps year over year, reflecting higher-than-expected revenues and improving operational efficiency.ON Semi incurred non-GAAP operating expenses of $284.9 million, up 50.6% from the year-ago quarter but down 1% from the previous quarter. The figure was towards the high-end of management's guided range $271-$285 million, primarily owing to higher variable compensation resulting from higher sales and investments in ADAS related strategic growth initiatives such as automotive radar and advanced image sensors.As percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined 330 bps from the year-ago quarter and 300 bps from the previous quarter to 19.8%.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 120 bps from the year-ago quarter to 11.8%. However, operating margin contracted 50 bps on a sequential basis, reflecting lower gross margin base.Cash & cash equivalents were $729 million, down $299 million sequentially. In the first quarter, operating cash flow was approximately $209 million as compared with $229 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow was $156 million, down from $179 million in the previous quarter.ON Semi now expects to exit 2017 with annual synergies run rate of $180 million, as compared with its earlier target of $160 million from the Fairchild acquisition. The company also raised annualized synergies run rate exiting 2018 to $220 million from $200 million. Total annual synergies from Fairchild are now anticipated to be $245 million, up from $225 million, which it expects to achieve by end of 2019.Management expects to see strong growth in revenue contribution from Fairchild in near to mid-term. All the end-market revenues are anticipated to increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis in second-quarter 2017.ON Semi believes that global automotive units should grow by low-single digit percentage annual rate in 2017. Moreover, management expects Industrial end-market to benefit from strong defense related revenues as ""depleted military stocks are being replenished"".ON Semi now forecasts revenues to be in the range of $1.285-$1.335 billion in second-quarter 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin are projected to be in the range of approximately 34.7-36.7%, while operating expenses of approximately $281-$295 million.Management now expects growth in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to decline in the latter half of the second quarter, much closer toward the company's target model (21%).On Semi expects free cash flow in the range of $500-$600 million for 2017.We believe that the improving end-markets are positive for ON Semi. The Fairchild acquisition has helped the company to grab a dominant position in the power semiconductor market with a planned focus on smartphone, automotive and industrial end markets.We note that automotive present significant growth prospects given strong demand for ADAS related applications. Moreover, the company's plan to sell products (like power modules) from consumer end-market to industrial applications end-market will boost margins and revenues in the long term.Additionally, higher synergies from the Fairchild acquisition along with improving operating leverage will boost profitability.Currently, On Semi carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Analog Devices  , Applied Optoelectronics,  and Micron Technology  sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) are other top ranked stocks in the broader technology sector.

" (NASDAQ: ADI) is believed to be a key supplier of the chip technology that enables  's(NASDAQ: AAPL) 3D Touch functionality that is present in the company's iPhone 6s-series and iPhone 7-series smartphones.Analog Devices said in its most recent form 10-K filing that it generated ""approximately 12% of fiscal 2016 revenue and 13% of fiscal 2015 revenue"" from its ""largest single customer."" Though Analog doesn't explicitly name this customer, I have a strong suspicion that it's Apple -- since Analog didn't have any 10%-plus customers in fiscal year 2014, during which time, Apple wasn't selling phones with 3D Touch capability).Image source: Apple.Interestingly, analyst Jun Zhang with Rosenblatt Securities (via  ) reportedly said that his team believes that ""Analog Devices might lose the force touch IC socket due to cost reductions from Apple."" Analysts with BlueFin Research (also via  ) disagree.The analysts say that Analog Devices' forecast for the second quarter ""improved slightly"" over the last 30 days to a sequential growth of 17%. This, the analysts say, is ""similar to last year's growth rate which included the production ramp for the iPhone 7.""""There have been rumors circulating that ADI may lose the iPhone Force Touch solution with the OLED iPhone 8, while maintaining their sockets on the iPhone 7s/7s Plus,"" the analysts reportedly wrote. ""We have not been able to corroborate this rumor and the production math doesn't seem to suggest content loss.""Indeed, the analysts further strengthen this argument by pointing out that the iPhone 8 is ""projected to be more than 50% of the next generation iPhone builds, yet current production ramp mirrors their 2016 iPhone 7 ramp.""Put another way, if Apple had designed Analog Devices out of the iPhone 8 but kept them around for the iPhone 7s/7sPlus, then Analog Devices should be seeing a sharp year-over-year decline in 3D-Touch-related component production and shipments.Given the possibility that Analog Devices depends on Apple for a substantial portion of its revenue, the news from BlueFin -- assuming it's accurate -- should allow Analog Devices shareholders to feel relieved. What's interesting, though, is that the reasoning behind the potential loss of the iPhone 8 spot doesn't make complete sense. Note that the iPhone 8 is supposed to be Apple's most feature-rich iPhone ever, with a price tag to match.The high price tag means that Apple should have a larger bill of materials budget to work with compared to the standard iPhone models. Why would Apple cut Analog Devices out of the iPhone 8 as a result of, per Zhang, ""cost reductions,"" when that's the phone that's less in need of such reductions?The rumor probably would have made more sense, at least prior to the BlueFin report -- again, assuming it's correct -- if it had said that the iPhone 7s/7s Plus wouldn't use Analog Devices' parts in a bid to cut costs, while the premium iPhone 8 would get the pricier Analog Devices parts.BlueFin has a good track record, and I'm inclined to believe what they have to say, but as always, ""trust but verify."" For investors and potential investors in Analog Devices who are concerned about potential share loss at Apple, keep a close eye on Analog Devices' consumer-oriented revenue segment in its financial reports, and listen to what management has to say on future earnings calls with respect to the matter.If Analog Devices reports flat-to-up shipments of consumer-related components in the coming quarters, it could be a good sign that Analog Devices' share position with respect to 3D Touch remains unchanged.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Analog Devices wasn't one of them!

"nvestors in Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) saw new options begin trading this week, for the December 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $77.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $77.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $72.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $79.52/share today.Because the $77.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.45% return on the cash commitment, or 10.06% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $77.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $79.52/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.89% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.29% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.81% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 24%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $79.52) to be 22%.

"Chicago, IL - April 13, 2017 - Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features:  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  )  and  (NASDAQ:  ).I told my followers in March to buy the decline to S&P 2325 for a very simple reason: the pullbacks would be shallow because fundamentals were strong and fund managers were under-exposed to the rally since November.Not only has the robust economic data been displaying a resiliency to any concerns about rising interest rates, but Q1 earnings are poised to deliver the highest profit gain of any quarter since 2011.And so that's why I've also been stating that a test of S&P 2300 has a good chance -- say 2 in 3 -- of marking the low in April. At worst, in my view, a 6% pullback from the peak at 2400 down to stronger support in the 2250-75 zone is what we should expect from this market and its very small wall of fundamental and valuation worries.So, given this optimistic backdrop, what should investors do with ready cash? Two words: Buy Technology. This dynamic sector -- which drives most economic innovation -- is the least dependent on or impacted by any policy out of DC.I've got a long list of technology names I'm focused on across many industries from software and services to hardware and chips. And I'm checking it twice a day to see which I like best and which are nearing my buy zones.Not surprisingly, many of them are in the semiconductor industries. So while I didn't intend for this to be an ""all the chips"" theme, it happens that three of my top Zacks #1 Rank picks are from that well of gushing profits.And even though the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) was up a blistering 12% on the year in March, reflecting large investor appetite for that growth, the run is not over this year. Any 5-10% correction should be bought because global technology cycles are still driving enterprise cap-ex and earnings for computer and communications equipment of all kinds.As of Tuesday April 11, the SOX is up only 8.5% YTD and the buying opportunities are starting to pop up.Here are three tech stocks each still possessing good upside potential in this cycle -- upside that you can enhance by getting a good edge on your entry. I give ""good edge"" buy zones for each. (NASDAQ:  ) This $88 billion ""arms dealer"" to both enterprise wired infrastructure customers and wireless smartphone makers and networks is the most diversified ""chip stock"" of the bunch.I've been recommending and swing trading AVGO since 2014 and $70, from where it has more than tripled. The stock has consistently claimed the top tier of the Zacks Rank every quarter as analysts keep raising top and bottom line estimates.In the middle of their Q2 of the current fiscal year ending in October, Broadcom is expected to grow sales by 28% and profits by 32%.Buy AVGO between $200 and $210. And if the corrective action for tech stocks heats up, grabbing any shares near $190 should offer an excellent risk/reward play. (NASDAQ:  ) AMAT makes semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the worldwide semiconductor industry. Customers for these products include wafer manufacturers and semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers, who either use the ICs they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies.I've been writing about AMAT since December as a great Bull of the Day to scoop up in the mid-$30s. Also in the midst of its Q2 of FY17 (ending October), AMAT is projected to advance the top line by 22% and profits by 51%.Buy AMAT between $36 and $37 for the best edge. More aggressive investor-traders can begin building positions on dips under $38. (NASDAQ:  ) Analog Devices is one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal processing applications.Applications for its products include communications, cellular telephones, computers and computer peripherals, consumer electronics, automotive electronics, factory automation, process control and military and space systems.On the same October 2017 fiscal year, ADI is expected to deliver growth of 42% on the top line and 32% on the bottom.Buy ADI between $74 and $77. On Tuesday, shares dipped just under $77 and are below their 60-period VWAP (volume-weighted moving average). I expect more pressure until a test of support in the $74-75 area. (NASDAQ:  )This Zacks #2 Rank is very similar to AMAT in terms of products and customers served, concentrating on front-end wafer processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The company's precision products are used in different capacities to etch away portions of various films to create an integrated circuit.In the middle of its June fiscal year, LRCX is projected to produce revenue growth of 33.4% and an earnings advance of 46.6%. Analysts at Pacific Crest recently raised their price target on shares to $163 while boutique investment bank Stifel Nicolaus hiked theirs to $150.Buy LRCX between $120 and $125. The VWAP is down just under $120 and I expect institutional buyers to be active well before then. We first bought LRCX on the last dip under $115 and are back in the shares now. Obviously, you don't want to buy all 4 of these semiconductor stocks for portfolios of under 20 names. But 2 or 3 of them would be pretty smart for a stable of 20+. I'm certainly looking forward to the opportunities to grab some more chip exposure at attractive levels again.Disclosure: I own LRCX shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader.You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

 , an original equipment manufacturer of positioning, surveying and machine control products, recently acquired Canadian-based BOS Forestry. The financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps.The company's share price increased 22.61% in the last two years compared with the Zacks  industry's gain of 12.85%. This was largely backed by the company's aggressive merger and acquisition strategy.Acquisitions have helped Trimble to build a comprehensive portfolio, enter new markets and generate additional revenues.The acquisition of BOS Forestry complements Trimble's Connected Forest solutions that provide full raw materials lifecycle management solutions and is expected to boost the company's forestry division.The acquisition, effective immediately, will extend Trimble's capabilities in serving its customers in the forestry business. The deal will focus on advanced technologies for better forest management, traceability and processing of timber.BOS Forestry is a leading provider of forestry software. The company's suite of applications will provide processes for scale site, log load, yard inventory, contractor settlement, finished goods sales and distribution.The acquisitions appear to be a part of Trimble's bid to expand its international business, sustaining its focus on commercial applications that, while being more macro-sensitive, allow a more stable revenue stream and better profits.Trimble has added a large number of companies over the past few years. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, it acquired 10, five and three companies, respectively, as well as important assets of several others to complement its current business and capabilities.These acquisitions are small in comparison to Trimble, so there have been no integration issues. Rather, the acquisitions facilitated market expansion and revenue buildup. The company also forms joint ventures to build positions in strategic areas. We expect acquisitions to remain an important growth driver going ahead. | Currently, Trimble has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are ON Semiconductor Corporation  , Analog Devices  and Microchip Technology Incorporated  . Each of these stocks sporta a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .For the current year, estimates for ON Semiconductor were up 7.8% in the last 60 days.

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of  , according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics - strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Analog Devices Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of ADI entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $77.06 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, the RSI reading has hit 26.5 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 51.2. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, ADI's recent annualized dividend of 1.80/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.27% based upon the recent $79.33 share price.A bullish investor could look at ADI's 26.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on ADI is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, ADI makes up 4.56% of the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSI) which is trading lower by about 2.1% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analog Devices Becomes Oversold@2017-04-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-becomes-oversold-2017-04-11
" 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) 30% rally over the past 12 months surprised many investors, who likely assumed that waning interest in iPhones would limit its upside potential. Yet robust demand for the iPhone 7 helped Apple beat both top and bottom line expectations for three straight quarters. Its sales are now expected to rise 6% this year, compared to an 8% decline in 2016.If you think that Apple still has room to run, you should also check out three of its top suppliers --  (NASDAQ: CRUS) ,  (NASDAQ: ADI) , and  (NASDAQ: SWKS) -- which could all be lifted by the tech giant's rally.Image source: Apple.Cirrus Logic makes audio chips for Apple devices. Two-thirds of its revenue came from Apple in fiscal 2016, making it a top supply chain bet on the iPhone 7 and the upcoming iPhone 8. Sales rose 28% to $1.2 billion in 2016, and analysts anticipate another 31% growth this year.Cirrus' heavy exposure to Apple is certainly risky, but it's gradually diversified away from its top customer -- which generated 80% of its sales back in 2014. One growing customer is  , which accounted for 15% of its 2016 sales. Looking further ahead, digital headsets, MEMS mics, voice biometrics, and growth among China OEMs could all boost its content share and diversify its top line beyond those two top smartphone makers.Cirrus' non-GAAP earnings dipped 10% in 2016 due to the impact of a patent deal. But looking ahead, its earnings are expected to rise a whopping 82% this year. Cirrus already rallied more than 60% over the past 12 months on Apple's strength, but it still trades at just 17 times earnings -- which is well below its industry average of 75.Analog Devices sells the sensor controllers which power Apple's Force Touch feature, which senses how much pressure is applied to a touchscreen or trackpad. The feature is used on new iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple Watches. The company's ""largest single customer"" (widely assumed to be Apple) accounted for 12% of its sales in 2016.The Apple Watch. Image source: Apple.The Apple Watch. That lower percentage makes Analog a more diversified play than Cirrus. It also provides other analog chips, amplifiers, digital signal processing products, and software to a wide variety of companies across the industrial, communications, and automotive markets. Nonetheless, analysts expect Apple's growth to help lift its sales by 44% this year, compared to nearly flat growth in 2016. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to rise 30%.Analog also pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%, which is comfortably supported by a payout ratio of 57%. It's hiked that dividend annually ever since its IPO in 2012. The stock's P/E of 28 is admittedly higher than its industry average of 22, but that premium can likely be justified by its above-average growth rates.Skyworks Solutions provides radio-frequency (RF) chips for the mobile, automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, smart home, industrial, and military markets. However, Apple is widely believed to be its biggest customer, accounting for 40% of its sales in fiscal 2016. Teardowns of the iPhone 7 reveal four Skyworks components inside, compared to two components in the iPhone 6s.That's why Skyworks' revenue is expected to rise 9% this year, compared to less than 1% growth last year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to grow 11% this year. Skyworks pays a seemingly low forward dividend of 1.1%, but its low payout ratio of 23% indicate that there's plenty of room for annual hikes -- which it has done for two straight years.Skyworks is gradually reducing its dependence on Apple by expanding into adjacent markets like connected cars, smart homes, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It's also scoring more design wins with Android OEMs. Skyworks currently trades at 21 times earnings, which is slightly lower than its industry average of 22.If I had to buy just one of these stocks, I'd pick Analog Devices for its diversified business and solid dividend. Cirrus and Skyworks are still great Apple plays, but investors should realize that Apple could switch suppliers at anytime or develop its own first-party components to replace third-party parts.If that happens -- just as it  to GPU chip designer  -- their shares could be crushed. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh those risks and rewards before investing in these top Apple suppliers.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now… and Analog Devices wasn't one of them!

Earnings significantly lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69 per share.Consolidated comparable sales were down 8.3%.""After reporting three consecutive years of comparable sales increases and improved profitability, these results are clearly disappointing. Through November, consolidated comparable sales were positive despite slightly negative traffic levels. However, similar to industry reported retail trends, our December traffic levels abruptly reversed, which adversely impacted both sales and profit for the quarter and the year,"" said the CEO.Analysts have slashed their estimates significantly after poor results.

GOOS stock closed the day up more than 25%, slightly higher than US$16, raising about $255 million and marking the second biggest IPO of 2017, behind Snap Inc. .While its IPO was a huge win for the company, Canada Goose will need to prove to investors that it can grow. In 2016, it reported revenues of $291 million, and $103 million of that number can from U.S. consumers. Canada Goose also reported gross profit of $146 million and net income of $27 million for the same year.A particular growth hurdle-and a risk the company even listed in its prospectus to potential investors-are protestors. Canada Goose, known for its $1,000 parkas with fur-trimmed hoods, was confronted with protesters from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) on Thursday, who stood outside both the NYSE and the TSX wearing coyote masks and waving signs that read, among other things, ""Indecent Public Offering"" and ""Trading in Lives is Bad for Business.""""We have been the target of activists in the past, and may continue to be in the future. Our products include certain animal products, including goose and duck feathers in all of our down-filled parkas and coyote fur on the hoods of some of our parkas, which has drawn the attention of animal welfare activists,"" the company said in its  with the SEC.Canada Goose created a program that traces where its materials are sourced from, with a  dedicated to its decision to use both ethically sourced fur and down.But PETA is using one of its  : buying the minimum amount of shares required to take part in a company's shareholder meetings.

" , a 3D printing company, recently entered into a strategic partnership with UK's Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC). The collaboration is aimed at accelerating additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and thereby strengthen manufacturing competitiveness by increasing supply chain efficiencies. However, the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Started in 2011, MTC is part of the High Value Manufacturing Project, which is supported by Innovate UK. The center offers innovative manufacturing processes and technologies appropriate for both large and small companies and applicable across varied industry sectors.Additive manufacturing is a process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data. The main functions of additive fabrication are designing/modeling, prototyping and direct part production. The use of AM facilitates quick design change, which helps to save cost and time.According to Andy Middleton, President, Stratasys, EMEA, ""This partnership and the integration of our technology solutions at the MTC underscores the fact that, more than ever, the UK is committed to exploring ways to bring growth to the UK economy and promote the real business benefits achievable from transformational technologies like additive manufacturing.""The collaboration with MTC for the development of the latest Infinite-Build 3-D Demonstrator is likely to reap synergistic benefits going forward. Partnering MTC will be a positive for Stratasys.We believe that the partnership will help Stratasys to gain competitive advantage over players like 3D Systems Corp.  . Moreover, the collaboration will expand and enhance Stratasys' AM or 3D Printing Platform. This association will also help Stratasys to attract new clients and strengthen its overall market position.The 3D printing market presents a favorable long-term investment opportunity as a large number of engineers, designers, architects and entrepreneurs are resorting to 3D solutions for their primary designing and product modeling.According to a recent survey by Lux Research, 3D printed parts will be an $8.4 billion  in 2025 led by automotive, medical and aerospace applications. Moreover, with the decline in cost of 3D printing as compared with traditional manufacturing, industries are increasingly adopting it in their manufacturing plants.Data from the Wohlers Report 2014 revealed that the worldwide 3D printing industry is expected to grow from $3.07 billion in 2013 to $12.8 billion by 2018, and exceed $21 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 34%.As the industry leader in 3D printing, this is encouraging information for Stratasys as it should take every opportunity to grab a large share of this market.The stock returned approximately 16.7% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of just 9.1%.Over the years, Stratasys' additive manufacturing solutions have been used by companies in the automotive, aerospace, defense, electronics, consumer goods, education and other sectors to improve product designs. Stratasys is also working with the U.S. Department of Energy to develop AM processes to aid in production.This deal is a strategic move by Stratasys to expand its geographic reach and drive market penetration. The partnership brings opportunities for Stratasys' 3D systems business and will increase its installed base. We believe that Stratasys' portfolio of new and innovative products will help it in the long run to push up sales.Stratasys has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials, Inc.  and Analog Devices, Inc.  with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each. You can see  .Applied Materials and Analog Devices have a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.5% and 10.4%, respectively.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

"nline retail giant,  , has agreed to acquire a Dubai-based ecommerce giant, SOUQ.com. The terms of the deal are yet to be revealed.However, according to media, the buyout is expected to cost less than $800 million which was recently offered by a rival bidder, Dubai's Emaar Malls, a unit of Emaar Properties. The deal is expected to close in 2017, subject to conditions.Souq.com is a Dubai-based online retail service. The company features more than 8.4 million products to customers in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and reportedly attracts more than 45 million visits per month.Goldman Sachs, the financial adviser for the transaction, called the deal ""the biggest-ever technology M&A transaction in the Arab world,"" as per Reuters. | Though the company has been successful in penetrating more or less every region across the world, it still has a long way to go before gaining a foothold in the Middle East and Africa. Amazon does not have a presence in the Middle East. This deal will mark the company's first move toward exploring this market.The Middle East covers approximately 50 million consumers across several countries. Despite that, only about 2% of all retail expenditure is made online, according to a McKinsey report. Hence, there is a good chance of Amazon capturing a significant share of this untapped market in the next few years.Undoubtedly, the deal will help Jeff Bezos's company to make its presence felt in key and emerging markets like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. This will see the company's revenues growing by a few billion dollars in the future.Amazon is one of the largest online retailers in the world, with extensive operations in North America. Although the primary product line was books, the company has diversified into a host of other product categories and now wants to have a global presence.The company's share price was $856 per share as of Mar 28, 2017, up 1.9% since its fourth-quarter earnings release in Feb 2, 2017. Shares of Amazon steadily trended up over the last one year. The stock generated returns of 44.50% compared with the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry's gain of 37.09%.We expect the aforesaid announcement to further boost investors' confidence in the stock.Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector are ON Semiconductor Corporation  , Analog Devices  and Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .For the current year, estimates for ON Semiconductor were up 7.8% in the last 60 days. Estimates for Analog Devices and Advanced Energy increased 20.4% and 18.2%, respectively, in the same time period.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

 reported mixed results for second-quarter fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.Lower-than-expected revenues made investors slightly cautious, pulling shares down 5.7% during yesterday's trade. Moreover, a tepid third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings guidance negatively impacted the share price.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.81, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and was toward the higher end of the guided range of $1.78-$1.82. Moreover, adjusted earnings improved 13.8% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings per share of $1.68 compared with $1.63 in the year-ago quarter.FactSet's revenues of $294.4 million increased 4.5% from the year-ago quarter but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $296 million. Moreover, reported revenues were toward the lower end of the guidance of $293-$298 million. Organic revenues increased 7% year over year to $291.5 million during the quarter.FactSet witnessed better-than-expected growth across products and geographic regions, which aided quarterly revenues.During the quarter, FactSet's revenues from the U.S. grew to $192 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and disposition, U.S. revenues and international revenues rose 5.9% and 8.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.The company's Annual Subscription Value (ASV) increased 6.5% year over year to $1.19 billion as of Feb 28, 2017. Of this, nearly 83.2% was generated by buy-side clients, while the rest came from sell-side firms performing functions like mergers & acquisition, advisory work and equity research.FactSet added 143 clients in the reported quarter, taking the tally to 4,404. The company retained 93% of its clients. The retention percentage was more than 95% of ASV.Coming to the operational metrics, FactSet reported a 3.1% rise in total operating expenses, primarily due to an increase in cost of services (6.2% higher on a year-over-year basis). As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 90 basis points to 68.8%.FactSet's adjusted operating income increased 4.5% from the year-ago quarter to $97.4 million. However, operating margin remained flat year over year at 33.1%, mainly due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income during the quarter was $71.8 million compared with $66.1 million in the year-ago quarter.FactSet exited the quarter with $155.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $173.3 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt during the quarter amounted to $365 million.Cash flow from operations during the six months ended Feb 28, 2017 was $128.1 million. The company generated free cash flow of $71 million in the reported quarter. FactSet purchased approximately 480K shares for $81.1 million under its existing share repurchase authorization. On Mar 27, 2017, the board of directors approved a $300 million expansion share repurchase program. At quarter end, the company had $336.5 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.For the fiscal third quarter, FactSet expects revenues in the range of $301-$307 million (mid-point $304 million). The BISAM acquisition is expected to add approximately $6 million to revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $303 million.Adjusted operating margin is expected between 32% and 33%. Adjusted earnings per share are projected in the band of $1.80-$1.86 (mid-point $1.83). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.85. The annual effective tax rate is expected within 25-26%.Recently, FactSet announced the acquisition of BISAM Technologies S.A. FactSet believes that BISAM's B-One solution will enhance its analytics suite and client-reporting capabilities. Its product - Cognity - is expected to boost FactSet's risk analysis for derivatives and quantitative portfolio construction. Hence, we believe that that the synergies from the acquisition will provide tailwind to the company's financials.FactSet reported mixed results for the fiscal second quarter. While earnings per share gave a decent show, quarterly revenues were toward the lower end of company's own guidance range.Notably, FactSet has underperformed the Zacks Categorized  industry. The company has gained just 0.7% on a year-to-date basis, while the industry recorded a growth of 8.7% in the same time frame.Nonetheless, we are encouraged by favorable year-over-year comparisons on both counts. Moreover, the company has a high client retention ratio, which is a positive. Also, ASV increased year over year and the company added a good number of clients.The share repurchase program is expected to support earnings in the long run apart from boosting shareholder value.The company continues with product innovation across its segments with special emphasis on financial services to gain more customers. Moreover, the company's acquisitions of Portware, Revere Data, Matrix Data and Code Red will enhance its product suite and help it to evolve as a global financial database company. It will also help FactSet to maximize value for its partners and provide exclusive content set.Nonetheless, substitute products at competitive prices, from the likes of Bloomberg L.P., Dow Jones & Company Inc., MSCI Inc.  and Thomson Reuters  are giving tough competition toFactSet.Currently, FactSet carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock worth considering in the broader technology sector is Analog Devices, Inc.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see  .Analog Devices has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10.4%.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Outflow Detected - SMH, ADI, MU, ASML@2017-03-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-outflow-detected-smh-adi-mu-asml-2017-03-20

"n Mar 7,  received a shot in the arm as the S&P Dow Jones Indices issued a statement declaring that the satellite TV operator will be added on the S&P 500 GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Cable & Satellite Sub-Industry index effective prior to the open of trade on Monday, Mar 13. As a result of this news, the stock price of DISH Network rallied 5.34% in the aftermarket trade on Nasdaq.DISH Network will be replacing semiconductor manufacturer Linear Technology Corp. which has been acquired by Analog Devices Inc.  in a $14.8 billion cash-and-stock deal. DISH Network currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  . However, we believe the Zacks Rank of the company is likely to witness upward revision following the news.DISH Network's effort to diversify business model from being a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet TV operator is encouraging. In fact, the company gained 28,000 pay-TV subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2016, owing to the popularity of its Internet TV service, Sling TV. Further, the flexible cash and liquidity position of the company opens up more avenues for investments.Meanwhile, launch of Air TV Player also augurs well. In Jan 2017, DISH Network's subsidiary, AirTV launched its latest streaming device, AirTV Player. This 4K Android-based streaming device which supports ultra HD (high definition) is pre-loaded with Netflix Inc.  , Sling TV and YouTube apps and also works with an over-the-air antenna for broadcast TV. Hence, AirTV marks ""a single unified"" platform for on-demand streaming, Internet TV, and over-the-air (OTA) local channels.In Feb 2017, DISH Network has entered into an asset-swap agreement with sister company, EchoStar Corp.  . Per the deal, DISH Network will obtain EchoStar's hardware and software technology development group, set-top box development and satellite uplink along with fiber-optic backhaul for its transmissions. Moreover, the deal will also transfer the 10% stake held by EchoStar in Sling TV and wireless spectrum licenses covering four markets in the 28 GHz band to DISH Network.Additionally, DISH Network will continue to market satellite broadband under the brand dishNET to rural customers. This deal will aid both parties to assimilate all the elements required to provide better customer experience while delivering the full DISH and Sling TV experience to the consumers.DISH Network, the second largest satellite TV operator in the U.S., has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. Several industry analysts have estimated the value of DISH's wireless spectrum at around $50 billion.Recently, DISH Network's CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter into the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has a clear plan to build a wireless network on its own. However, entering in the wireless market either separately or in collaboration with any incumbent carrier will further diversify the company's business model.The past six months have been extremely good for DISH Network's investors. During that period, the stock returned 20.52%, outshining the Zacks categorized  industry's increase of 9.91%. Nevertheless, cable TV industry is facing massive cord-cutting threat from low-cost online streaming service providers.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest tickers for the entirety of 2017?Who wouldn't?

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH) where we have detected an approximate $27.2 million dollar outflow -- that's a 4.3% decrease week over week (from 8,120,937 to 7,770,937).

The chart below shows the one year price performance of SMH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SMH's low point in its 52 week range is $48.27 per share, with $77.82 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $77.43. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Noteworthy ETF Outflows: SMH, ASML, ADI, LRCX@2017-02-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-etf-outflows-smh-asml-adi-lrcx-2017-02-22

" , the largest mobile chipset manufacturer globally, has moved a step closer toward its proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant  . Recently, NXP Semiconductors announced that its shareholders have approved the company's takeover by Qualcomm during an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders held on Jan 27, 2017.In Oct 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with NXP Semiconductor to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductors share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is anticipated to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.NXP Semiconductors is a leading manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is likely to generate annual revenues of over $30 billion. Further, it will position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm has decided to float a new foreign subsidiary called ""Qualcomm River Holdings B.V."", based in Amsterdam, which will issue tender offer to acquire NXP Semiconductors. Flotation of foreign subsidiary is necessary to avoid paying tax on its offshore cash. As of Jun 30, 2016, Qualcomm had $2.4 billion of cash and equivalents in the U.S., and another $28.6 billion as offshore cash. The company doesn't need to pay tax on the offshore cash, as long as it is reinvested offshore.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.The major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is the leader in mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets are gradually slowing down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For last couple years, the company's business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP Semiconductors manufacturers chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will enable Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.This transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings.In the last one year, the stock price of Qualcomm has gained 16.24% compared with 8.66% loss witnessed by the Zacks categorized  industry. Qualcomm, the undisputed leader in the global wireless baseband chipset market is widening its presence in adjacent opportunities, including automotive, networking and mobile computing strategies, which bode well for long-term growth. Qualcomm's Snapdragon processor is best known for its versatility in IoT applications.However, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms and anti-competitive charges are some of the major headwinds faced by the company. We believe that these are the reasons behind the company's currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"nce an investors' favorite in the semiconductor space, things have not been in favor of  for a while now.For the past one year, NXP Semiconductors has returned 26.8% compared with the Zacks categorized  industry's average return of 37.6%.Over the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. NXP Semiconductors faces stiff competition from other well-established players in the semiconductor space, which includes ON Semiconductor Corporation  , Analog Devices, Inc.  and Microchip Technology Incorporated  . Also, consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market remain headwinds.Moreover, combined with other unfavorable factors like low return on equity (ROE) and low return on assets (ROA), the stock looks very unattractive. NXP Semiconductors currently trades at a ROE of 11.6%, much lower than the peer average of 18.6%. Notably, the company has an ROA of 5.2% compared with the peer average of 7.2%. Also, its return on capital (ROC) looks very dull. It has returned just 6.6% compared with the peer average of 10.8%Furthermore, the company delivered negative earnings surprises in two out of the last four quarters with an average miss of 5.6%.Adding to the woes, the company reported not so-encouraging third-quarter 2016 earnings of 26 cents, down from $1.49 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.NXP Semiconductors has a highly leverage balance sheet. The company had a long-term debt position of $8.76 billion at the end of third-quarter 2016 compared with $8.27 billion reported in the previous quarter. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately just $1.57 billion compared with $1.33 billion reported in the previous quarter. Thus, the company has to constantly generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt.To counter the aforementioned challenges, NXP Semiconductors has taken a number of initiatives. The company is putting itself up for sale. Qualcomm Inc., the largest mobile chipset manufacturer globally, had entered into a definitive agreement in October last year to acquire the NXP Semiconductors. Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductor share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker.NXP Semiconductors is a leading manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners.The deal could be particularly important for NXP Semiconductors, given its recent losses and stiff competition. If Qualcomm manages to win the bid and NXP Semiconductors accepts its offer, it will certainly strengthen its position as a chipset giant.Although the company's earnings comparison on a year-over-year basis was not so encouraging, its top line comparisons were favorable. NXP Semiconductors' revenues grew 62.2% year over year to $2.469 billion and marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.465 billion.Revenues were boosted by a 62.5% increase in Product revenues and a 51.5% increase in Corporate & Other revenues on a year-over-year basis. Also, an increase in High Performance Mixed Signal (HPMS) segment revenues (up 80.3% on a year-over-year basis) positively impacted the quarter's results.The company also provided an encouraging fourth quarter revenue guidance. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, NXP Semiconductors expects revenues in the range of $2.390 billion to $2.490 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.439 billion.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. These factors are likely to drive the semiconductor industry this year.With the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products.NXP Semiconductors is currently trading at a lower price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the peer average. Therefore, we believe that NXP Semiconductors with its lower forward P/E valuation of 16.5x compared with the peer average of 30.4x may be a good bet.The stock's long-term earnings per share growth rate is 24.7% and it has a VGM Score of ""B"". These factors are also likely to aid the company's long-term results.We believe that the company's turnaround efforts will yield results in the long run. We are optimistic about NXP Semiconductors' recovery in 2017, given the positive factors and its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

TI focuses on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain segments of the automotive market.In the last reported third quarter, the automotive market retained its strength with all five sectors within it growing in double digits. Overall, we remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm Analog output that should drive earnings. We note that channel inventories remain very low, meaning that demand is likely to remain strong.The launch will enhance Texas Instruments' differentiated product pipeline and is expected to improve its market share in the auto market.

These applications include camera-based front (mono/stereo), rear, surround view and night vision systems, and multi-range radar and sensor fusion systems.The Jacinto processors are based on a heterogeneous architecture, which includes hardware firewalls to separate High Level OS (HLOS), and safety OS and software architecture capable to be ASIL-B safety certified. These processors which feature in-vehicle infotainment, instrument cluster and telematics, support a number of automotive digital cockpit applications. These applications include infotainment, head unit co-processing for infotainment, informational ADAS, integrated digital cockpit, digital instrument cluster, head-up display, among others.Both these processors are specifically designed keeping in mind the safety requirements and robustness in the automotive space.The company is seeing steady improvement in certain fast-growing segments of the automotive market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% between 2016 and 2022, according to a report from marketsandmarkets.com.TI focuses on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain segments of the automotive market. The company has made significant progress on the ADAS side, shipping millions of chips into this market. The company intends to keep the momentum alive as the electronic content in cars (currently around $350, or 1% of average car price) continues to improve.In the last reported third quarter, the automotive market retained its strength with all five sectors within it growing in double digits. Overall, we remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm Analog output that should drive earnings. We note that channel inventories remain very low thus the demand is likely to remain strong.The new processors will enhance Texas Instruments' differentiated product pipeline and is expected to improve its market share in the auto market.

" , the largest mobile chipset manufacturer globally, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Netherlands-based chipset giant  . Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductor share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is anticipated to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.NXP Semiconductors is a leading manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is likely to generate annual revenues of over $30 billion. Further, it will position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm has decided to float a new foreign subsidiary called ""Qualcomm River Holdings B.V."", based in Amsterdam, which will issue tender offer to acquire NXP Semiconductors. Flotation of foreign subsidiary is necessary to avoid paying tax on its offshore cash. As of Jun 30, 2016, Qualcomm had $2.4 billion of cash and equivalents in the U.S., and another $28.6 billion as offshore cash. The company doesn't need to pay tax on the offshore cash, as long as it is reinvested offshore.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. The company also expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes. Both Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .The major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is the leader in mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets are gradually slowing down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For last couple years, the company's business remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP Semiconductors manufacturers chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP Semiconductors will enable Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.This transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp.  in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd.  , Analog Devices Inc.  and ARM Holdings. | Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

"t's always awkward to follow financial results for a company that's the target of a takeover bid. For  (NASDAQ: LLTC) , the pending acquisition by  (NASDAQ: ADI) has most investors focusing more on the prospects of an early 2017 closing on the deal than on Linear Tech's results. Nevertheless, both companies still have to keep working hard on their own in the interim, and coming into Tuesday's fiscal first-quarter financial report, Linear Tech investors expected to see solid double-digit percentage gains in earnings and revenue. The company fell short of that goal on the top line, and earnings didn't rise quite as much as most had hoped. Let's take a closer look at Linear Technology to see what its latest quarter told investors about what could be its last year of being an independent company.Image source: Linear Technology.Linear Technology's fiscal first-quarter results didn't quite live up to the expectations that investors had for the semiconductor stock. Revenue rose 9% from year-ago levels to $373.9 million, but that was shy of the nearly 11% growth rate that most of those following the stock had expected. Net income came in at $115.1 million, up about 3% from the fiscal first quarter of 2016. After making adjustments for merger-related charges, adjusted earnings of $0.53 per share were still $0.01 per share shy of the consensus forecast among investors.Taking a closer look at Linear Tech's financials, the company had a mix of good attributes and things that needed improvement. Gross margin expanded by about a third of a percentage point to 75.4%, but operating expenses ballooned at a much faster rate than Linear Tech's top line. As a result, operating income was actually slightly lower from year-ago levels, and it was only reduced provisions for income taxes that saved Linear Tech from a year-over-year drop in net income.Once again, Linear Tech continued to get most of its business from the same sectors. The industrial and transportation sectors accounted for about two-thirds of Linear Tech's total bookings during the quarter, with communication-related bookings making up more than half of the remainder. From a geographical standpoint, North America, Europe, and Japan combined to bring in about three-fifths of Linear Tech's revenue, with the company's rest-of-world segment making up the remainder.CEO Lothar Maier tried to focus on the solidity of Linear Tech's financials, noting that ""revenue for our first fiscal quarter came in as we expected."" Nevertheless, the company pointed to strength in transportation-related bookings in Japan and China as well as satellite communications, both of which offset weaker results in notebook computer applications and a soft European economy.Linear Technology also warned about the results for its fiscal second quarter, but it said some encouraging things nevertheless. ""The December quarter is typically a seasonally weak quarter due to a slower European market and in particular a weaker industrial market,"" Maier said, ""that historically often results in a sequential quarterly revenue decline."" The CEO's assessment of the situation wasn't quite that negative, pointing to positive book-to-bill ratios as likely creating flat sales sequentially, equating to a 7% to 8.5% year-over-year gain on the top line.Nevertheless, it's hard for Linear Tech investors to get too excited or worried about the results. Back in July, the company said that Analog Devices would acquire the chipmaker for $14.8 billion, consisting of a combination of cash and stock. For every Linear Tech share they own, investors will receive $46 in cash as well as 0.2321 shares of Analog Devices. All told, the deal valued Linear Tech at roughly $60 per share, and that's close to where the stock trades now.Linear Technology stock fell after the results were announced, dropping by about 1.5% and closely mirroring weakness in Analog Devices stock as well. In the long run, though, the only major threat to Linear Tech shares is the possibility of something getting in the way of the Analog Devices merger. Absent that, Linear Tech will focus much more on Analog Devices' performance going forward.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of 53 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Earnings decreased 1.9% sequentially but increased 15.2% year over year.In Jul 2016, Linear had announced that Analog Devices, Inc.  has agreed to acquire its business in a cash and stock deal worth $30 billion. Per the agreement, Linear shareholders will receive $46.00 in cash for each share and an additional 0.2321 of Analog Devices common stock for each Linear share.In the reported quarter, Linear Technology's stockholders approved the merger agreement under which Analog Devices will acquire Linear Technology. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of calendar year 2017.The acquisition is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings and cash flow going forward. Also, the companies expect to realize $150 million in annual cost synergies in the first 18 months following the closure. The merger of these two companies will create an analog industry leader across a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale. The deal will expand Analog Devices' total addressable market to $14 billion from $8 billion, allowing it to tap the phenomenal demand in some of the most attractive markets, namely industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets.A quick look at the numbers:Linear reported revenues of $373.9 million, up 9.4% year over year but flat sequentially. The figures were slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $379.0 million.Pro forma gross margin was 76.0%, down 41 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 90 bps year over year.Operating expenses of $112.9 million decreased 0.7% sequentially but increased 5.8% year over year. As a percentage of sales, research & development and selling, general & administrative expenses increased from the year-ago quarter. As a result, operating margin of 45.2% was down 71 bps sequentially but up 138 bps year over year.GAAP net income was $115.1 million or 47 cents per share compared with $132.4 million or 54 cents in the previous quarter and $112.0 million or 46 cents a year ago. Excluding the merger- related charges, pro-forma earnings were $130.2 million versus $132.4 million in the previous quarter and $112.0 million in the year-ago quarter.Linear exited the fiscal first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.52 billion compared with $1.45 billion in the prior quarter. Account receivables were $162.4 million, up from $157.5 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.Linear generated $167.8 million from cash for operations and spent $8.3 million on capital expenditures. The company repurchased shares worth $10.8 million and paid $78.6 million as dividend.For the fiscal second quarter of 2017, management expects revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $366.7 million.Linear Technology reported a weak quarter with both earnings and revenues missing our expectations.The company's business is well diversified among core markets, including industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which should increase investors' confidence, in our view. | Currently, Linear Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 , one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits, will report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Nov 22.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices delivered better-than-expected results for the third quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. These strong results were driven by a strong consumer market, which offset relatively weak industrial, auto and communication markets.In 2015, the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded the available opportunities. It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting 2017.Analog Devices will acquire Linear Technology in a cash and stock deal worth $14.8 billion. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. It will make Analog Devices an industry leader across a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale. The deal will help it to grow significantly in industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets.The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to the company's bottom line results. In addition, the company expects annualized cost synergies of $150 million within the first 18 months following the completion of the transaction.While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, management expects revenues in a range of $910 million to $970 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 65.5%, operating expenses to be slightly up sequentially, interest and other expense of about $20 million, tax rate of approximately 12% and earnings per share in a range of 84-94 cents.On a GAAP basis, the company estimates earnings per share in a range of 78-88 cents. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

 is set to report third-quarter 2016 results on Oct 26. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 4.50%. Notably, NXP Semiconductors has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the four preceding quarters with an average positive surprise of 1.04%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company known for its automotive and chip identification business, has seen massive growth in the portable device segment over the past year. This trend is expected to have continued in the third quarter as well.Persistently strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of a new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. This should boost NXP Semiconductors' third-quarter revenues.With last year's acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products. We believe that this acquisition will add to the company's third-quarter earnings as it did in the previous two quarters.It should be noted that while announcing the merger, NXP Semiconductors had forecast that the acquisition will be accretive to its non-GAAP earnings in 2016 as well as achieve cost savings of approximately $200 million. Apart from this, it also anticipated to create a path to achieve an annual cost synergy of about $500 million in the long run.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Analog Devices Inc.  and ON Semiconductor Corp., consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market may negatively impact NXP Semiconductors' results in the to-be reported quarter. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that NXP Semiconductors will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP for NXP Semiconductors is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.37 per share. NXP Semiconductors has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NVIDIA Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +8.93% and a Zacks Rank #3.You can see  .Boyd Gaming Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +16.67% and a Zacks Rank #2Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

" recently entered into a new unsecured term loan facility that will help it to raise a total amount of 5.0 billion.The facility consists of a $2.5 billion term loan with a 3-year maturity and another $2.5 billion term loan with a 5-year maturity.Per the company, the new term loan will have an interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") but will vary depending on the company's debt ratings. Based on its current debt ratings, Analog Devices expects the effective interest rate of the term loans to be approximately 2%.The company aims to use the funds raised from the offering to partially fund the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation  . In July, Analog Devices agreed to acquire Linear in a cash and stock deal worth $14.8 billion. Per the agreement, Linear shareholders will receive $46.00 in cash for each share and an additional 0.2321 of Analog Devices common stock for each Linear share.As a result, the borrowings under the term loan facility will depend on the closing of the proposed acquisition.Simultaneously, Analog Devices announced that it is expanding its revolving credit facility. This move is likely to further boost the company's liquidity strength.Notably, the borrowing capacity under this facility has been expanded by $250 million to $1 billion. However, the revolving credit facility will expire on July 10, 2020 and is currently undrawn.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. The company aims to maintain a healthy balance sheet which will enable it to implement its growth strategies. This will also reinforce Analog Devices' M&A discipline, encourage shareholder cash return commitments and lower its cost of borrowing.In the recently concluded third-quarter fiscal 2016, the company spent $129 million cash to pay dividends and repurchase$23 million worth shares.Exiting the quarter, Analog Devices had cash and short-term investments of approximately $3.80 billion, up from $3.75 billion in the prior quarter. Long-term debt was approximately $1.7 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $2.07 billion.The acquisition of Linear Technology will make Analog Devices an industry leader across a wide range of products, customer breadth and scale. The company expects to achieve annualized cost synergies of $150 million within the first 18 months after completion of the transaction.The deal will expand Analog Devices' total addressable market to $14 billion from $8 billion, allowing it to tap the phenomenal demand in some of the most attractive markets, namely industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure markets.In August, Analog also snapped up the Cyber Security Solutions unit of Sypris Electronics LLC for $42 million. This acquisition is expected to enhance Analog Devices' position in secure radio communications that are widely used in the aerospace and defense sectors.The company is also investing in the healthcare sector. It is working with research institutions and system OEMs to improve performance and affordability of medical electronic devices with major focus on clinical-grade vital signs monitoring and care-imaging applications.In addition, extensive buybacks and encouraging dividends should keep investor interest alive in the stock. | Currently, Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"n an attempt to boost its presence in the data center and enterprise markets, leading semiconductor solution provider  has launched a new family of high performance frequency synthesizers and rate converters.The miClockSynth family comprises new ZL30260-ZL30267 devices capable of creating up to four independent frequency families of extremely low jitter clock signals from a clock input or crystal source, thereby simplifying board design to a great extent.The devices feature two fractional-N analog phase locked loops (APLLs) with a fractional and integer divider, up to 10 differential or 20 single ended configurable outputs and spread-spectrum modulation mode.These can be used in place of many synthesizers, multipliers and oscillators on the board. They increase design reliability and lower bill of materials (BOM). They have a graphical user interface and can pre-program devices using Microsemi's web tool, miClockDesigner.The devices also offer any-rate frequency conversion with any input frequency between 0 MHz and 1.2 GHz to any output frequency less than 1 Hz and up to 1 GHz. They also feature a highly precise numerically controlled oscillator with steep output frequency and high resolution.These can reduce the number of termination components by configuring output format with native LVDS, LVPECL, HCSL, 2xCMOS or HSTL.miClockSynth is targeted at communication, enterprise, data center and video markets. For this, the company has made the devices compatible with a number of applications such as enterprise switches and routers, servers, storage systems, wireless backhauls, wireless, base stations, access infrastructure, PCIe and 1G/2.5G/10G/25G/40G/25G/100G Ethernet.Moves like these make sense given the increasing demand in the servers and storage network market. Per a report from market research firm Databeans titled, ""Q4-2015 Timing Devices Market Tracker,"" this market is expected to grow to $63 billion with an average growth rate of 11% through 2020.Microsemi continues to invest heavily in research and development (R&D) in order to stay ahead of its peers. This is particularly necessary because of the markets in which it operates, since competition in these markets is stiff and industry standards are changing rapidly. To remain ahead of competitors like Texas Instruments  , Advanced Micro Devices  and Analog Devices  , Microsemi has to develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and launch new products in a cost effective manner.Microsemi increased R&D spending more than 4% from 2014 to 2015 and 1.5% from 2013 to 2014 while revenues increased 9.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Although the increased spending will hurt profits in the short term, we believe that it will prove to be beneficial in the long term.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PBP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $23.12 per unit.With PBP trading at a recent price near $21.04 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.91% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Total System Services, Inc. (Symbol: TSS), FLIR Systems, Inc. (Symbol: FLIR), and Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI). Although TSS has traded at a recent price of $48.01/share, the average analyst target is 21.43% higher at $58.30/share. Similarly, FLIR has 20.56% upside from the recent share price of $30.69 if the average analyst target price of $37.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting ADI to reach a target price of $75.41/share, which is 16.48% above the recent price of $64.74. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of TSS, FLIR, and ADI:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

here's a company, which, besides providing all necessary information on travel and tourism, helps you to plan and organize your entire trip without any online accessibility.In a bid to boost the overall travel experience,  owned search giant Google, on Monday, unveiled a new smartphone app - Google Trips. The app allows users to organize flight, hotel, car and restaurant reservations virtually anywhere across the globe.Google Trips - available on iOS and Android - helps a user to manage and organize a vacation in the best possible way. The app automatically pulls details of a user's trip from his or her Gmail account and then stores its offline. It recommends restaurants, attractions and new places for the user to visit while on vacation.The best thing about the app is that the saved itineraries and reservations can be downloaded and used later even when there is no internet connectivity. Thus, the company intends to free vacations from hassle with the Google Trips app.Competition in this lucrative market is also intensifying, with companies like TripAdvisor Inc. and Yelp Inc. doing their best to expand their customer base. In June, Yahoo rolled out Yahoo Radar, which organizes reservations and highlights sights and nearby restaurants. Home-sharing startup Airbnb Inc. is also working on a trip-planning app of its own. To counter competition, Google has a prudent plan, which includes continued innovation, including the development of new apps and addition of new features to keep customers interested in the company.Google Trips is set to benefit travelers at large. The company's ability to innovate has translated into strong growth. However, Google refuses to rest on its past laurels. Its continued efforts to launch products and services for multiple industries, and adapt to changing market trends are commendable.The online travel market is growing rapidly driven by increased digitization, mobile adoption and shift from offline channels. A stronger economy and higher spending levels provide the perfect backdrop for growth.With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets among travelers around the world, travel apps have become essential. These apps offer a convenient way to receive and access information at a glance.Google's own research has indicated that travel and shopping-related searches on mobile have increased by 30% over the past one-year period. So, it appears that with this new app, the company is set to join the smartphone revolution leveraging its core capability - search. | At present, Google has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Net income saw a sharper increase, moving 6% to $230 million ($0.74 per diluted share; $0.82 on an adjusted basis).Image source: Getty Images.Those numbers were more than enough to exceed the average analyst estimates, which anticipated just over $865 million on the top line and an adjusted per-share net income of $0.76.Out of the company's four divisions, communications was the star performer, with its revenue rising by 23% to over $174 million, or around 20% of total top line. The automotive unit also saw gains, while the take for both the consumer and industrial divisions fell on a year-over-year basis.Judging by the tepid rise in the stock price in the wake of the results release, investors didn't seem too impressed with Analog Devices' Q3.Perhaps it was overshadowed by last month's news that the company would acquire the complementary  (NASDAQ: LLTC) , an analog integrated circuits manufacturer.

esterday marked the closure of the $67 billion takeover of EMC Corp by Dell Inc. The new company named Dell Technologies now holds approximately 80% of  shares, which were earlier held by its parent company EMC. The remaining 20% of the shares are held by the shareholders and will continue to trade for now.VMware yesterday announced that Michael S. Dell will take up the role of Chairman of VMware's board of directors, replacing Joseph M. Tucci who held the position for the last nine years. Another change in management is the appointment of Egon Durban to the company's board of directors in place of John R. Egan.The news, however, failed to cheer investors as shares dipped 0.9% in yesterday's trading session.In fact, investor sentiments have remained muted since the news of the EMC-Dell merger first appeared in Oct 2015.Per the deal, Dell created a tracking stock from 53% of the value of total VMware shares. The tracking stock reflects the performance of the trading stock. This entitles EMC shareholders to economic interest in the trading stock but they do not own them (that is no voting rights or dividends).Through the EMC acquisition, Dell got a significant control of VMware (at quite a discounted price). As a result, investors are jittery regarding the valuation of the company. Moreover, it also gave Dell an ability to raise its stake further in the future.Nonetheless, for now, VMware appears to be on a robust growth trajectory. The company does have a broad product portfolio,which places it in a unique position in the virtualization space with a robust market share (two-third of the total server virtualization market).Currently, VMware has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Capital IQ has a 12-month price target of $71 on ADI stock.Turning to the chart, we can see that ADI stock broke a major bear market resistance line in March, but it failed to hold above it, dropping back below it by the end of April.

 , one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits, is expected to beat expectations when it reports third quarter fiscal 2016 results on Aug 17.Our proven model shows that Analog Devices is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Analog Devices has the right combination of the two key components. Analog Devices currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.63%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 78 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 76 cents. : It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an ESP of +2.63% make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Analog Devices is investing heavily in the health sector and working with several of the world's leading research institutions and system OEMs to improve performance, impact and affordability of medical electronics devices. The focus areas within this segment include care-imaging applications and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring.In 2015, the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded the available opportunities. It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting 2017.While its investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.Analog Devices will acquire Linear Technology in a cash and stock deal worth $14.8 billion. The acquisition will make Analog Devices an industry leader across a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale. The deal will help it to grow significantly in industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure markets.The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to the company's bottom-line results. In addition, the company expects annualized cost synergies of $150 million within the first 18 months post transaction completion. | Here are some other stocks, which you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Carbonite, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #1.Stoneridge Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.71% and a Zacks Rank #1.Cognex Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.17% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Aug 17. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 37.50%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 18.84%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Synopsys is a vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software to the semiconductor and electronics industries. We believe that the company's recent product launches, acquisitions and deal wins will boost third-quarter results.Moreover, the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys will likely drive the upcoming results. Additionally, the company's acquisitions, such as those of Gold Standard Simulations, Simpleware and Coverity, have expanded its capabilities and customer base, which are expected to aid results in the to-be-reported quarter.However, intense competition, a challenging technology spending environment and uncertainty on the proper time to realize acquisition synergies keep us on the sidelines. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Synopsys will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 43 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Although Synopsys' Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of stocks that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  , with an Earnings ESP of +25.58% and a Zacks Rank #3.Analog Devices Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.The J.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Analog Devices is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ADI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 78 cents per share for ADI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ADI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.63% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that ADI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Analog Devices, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter, thereby boosting the company's top line.Moreover, the company enhanced its logistics to improve customers' shopping experience. It also expanded the product assortment at its stores during the first half of 2016, which should aid top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The financing program for customers launched during the first quarter is expected to boost customer spending.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $64.02/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $52.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.5% return against the $52.50 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADI's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $52.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Analog Devices Inc sees its shares fall 18% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $49.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.40 from $52.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 4.5% figure actually exceeds the 2.6% annualized dividend paid by Analog Devices Inc by 1.9%, based on the current share price of $64.02. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 17.96% to reach the $52.50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.6% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices Inc, and highlighting in green where the $52.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $52.50 strike for the 4.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Analog Devices Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.02) to be 30%.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Aug 9. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 18.37%. Notably, Broadridge has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of 14.30%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Broadridge is a leading global provider of technology-based outsourcing solutions to the financial services industry. We believe Broadridge's strategic initiatives such as acquisitions and product launch will continue driving its top- and bottom-line results. Moreover, the company's close business relations with Accenture Plc  will positively impact its revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Furthermore, strength in the company's products and services, led by the Investor Communications business, allows it to brave the ongoing economic challenges. We believe that these positives, combined with new product initiatives, will enable the company to counter macro headwinds to a large extent. They will also provide Broadridge an opportunity to grow further as and when the financial services market improves.However, competition and pricing pressure remain major concerns. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Broadridge is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.46. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Broadridge holds a Zacks Rank #2.

Notably, the stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 76.51%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We remain positive about Paylocity's regular investments in SaaS technology. Notably, over the past few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to SaaS-based services generated a significant portion of the company's revenues. Therefore, we believe regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovations, will continue to boost Paylocity's top line over the long run. Such initiatives are also likely to have a positive impact on the upcoming results.Furthermore, higher adoption of Paylocity's ACA dashboard application which tracks employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability will act as a tailwind over the long run.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc.  , Oracle Corporation and SAP SE remains a headwind. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Paylocity is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 12 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Paylocity carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies that are worth considering as our model shows that they have the right combination of the two elements needed to post an earnings beat:Analog Devices Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  , with an Earnings ESP of +28.95% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 reported third quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expenses.Analog Devices generated revenues of $869.6 million, up 11.7% sequentially and 0.7% year over year. The sequential growth was due to improved performance in the consumer market offsetting weakness in industrial, automotive and communications markets.Moreover, revenues exceeded the company's guidance range of $800 million-$840 million. It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $852.5 million.The Industrial market generated 43% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 2.7% sequentially and 2.5% year over year). This represents a diversified market for the company, including industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and health care segments.Communications generated 20% of total revenue, down 0.7% sequentially but up 22.4% year over year.The Automotive segment generated around 16% of Analog Devices' third quarter revenues, down 2.5% sequentially but up 3.5% year over year.The Consumer segment, which Analog Devices clubs with its computing and handset businesses, increased 132.5% sequentially and decreased 10.0% year over year. It accounted for 21% of total revenue.Pro-forma gross margin was 66.0%, up 23 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 3 bps year over year. The decline was primarily due to higher inventory reserves and lower utilization rates.Analog Devices reported adjusted operating expenses of $277.7 million, up 2.0% sequentially and 0.9% year over year. Pro-forma operating margin of 34.1% was up 327 bps sequentially but down 10 bps year over year.On a GAAP basis, Analog Devices recorded a net profit of $230.4 million or 74 cents per share compared with $216.5 million or 68 cents in the year ago quarter.The company generated adjusted net profit of $258.2 million compared with $245.7 million in the third quarter fiscal of 2015. Pro-forma earnings per share came in at 82 cents compared with 77 cents in the year ago quarter.Analog Devices exited the third quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $3.80 billion, up from $3.75 billion in the prior quarter. Accounts receivables were $453 million, up from $399 million in the previous quarter.Long-term debt was approximately $1.7 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $2.07 billion.Net cash flow from operations was around $254 million. Analog Devices spent $23 million on share repurchases and $129 million on cash dividends during the third quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, management expects revenues in a range of $910 million to $970 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $935.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 65.5%, operating expenses to be slightly up sequentially, interest and other expense of about $20 million, tax rate of approximately 12% and earnings per share in a range of 84-94 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 88 cents.On a GAAP basis, the company estimates earnings per share in a range of 78-88 cents. | Analog Devices delivered better-than-expected results for the third quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top and the bottom line. These strong results were driven by a strong consumer market which offset relatively weak industrial, auto and communication markets.In 2015, the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded the available opportunities. It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting 2017.Analog Devices will acquire Linear Technology in a cash and stock deal worth $14.8 billion. The acquisition will make Analog Devices an industry leader across a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale. The deal will help it to grow significantly in industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure markets.The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to the company's bottom line results. In addition, the company expects annualized cost synergies of $150 million within the first 18 months post transaction completion.The company is investing heavily in the health sector and working with several of the world's leading research institutions and system OEMs to improve performance, impact and affordability of medical electronics devices. Primary focus areas within this segment include care-imaging applications and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring.While investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the wider technology sector are Silicon Laboratories Inc.  , Charter Communications, Inc.  and Fabrinet  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is expected to report second-quarter 2016 results on Aug 5. Last quarter, it posted a negative earnings surprise of 5.94%. Scientific Games has posted positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive earnings surprise of 23.39%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Scientific Games' premium position in the gaming equipment space along with a robust product line and a recovering financial position are significant positives. Also, we are optimistic about the company's ongoing cost cutting initiatives. Bally Technologies and WMS Industries acquisitions are positives for the company as they diversify its product portfolio and expand its global footprint.Scientific Games' business has been impacted because of the weakness in the gaming segment, especially with regard to WAP, premium installed base and gaming systems. Also, the acquisitions put Scientific Games' balance sheet under pressure as the company opted for debt financing for the buyout. Further, significant competition continues to be a major concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Scientific Games is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Scientific Games has an Earnings ESP of -29.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of $1.06 whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 82 cents. Scientific Games has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. | Here are some stocks that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2.CenturyLink, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +5.08% and a Zacks Rank #2.Exelon Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +1.79% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is scheduled to report second-quarter 2016 results on Aug 4, after market close.In the last quarter, Motorola Solutions posted a positive earnings surprise of 27.27%. In fact, the company has an impressive track record with respect to earnings, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 20.13%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Motorola has been focused on boosting its public safety LTE portfolio with a string of investments in Android and devices like TC55, LEX 700 and LEX L10 which is expected to bolster growth. The company's new range of products such as those compatible with TETRA two-way radios announced at Critical Communications World 2016 displays its commitment toward innovation. The company's steady returns to shareholders also continue to impress.However, the acquisition of U.K.-based Airwave Solutions is likely to impact results due to currency fluctuations post Brexit. Additionally, the company's weak balance sheet coupled with heavy reliance on government agency expenditures are major concerns. The company also faces tough competition from the likes of Nokia Corporation  and Harris Corporation  . . Meanwhile, Motorola has struggled to boost revenues of late. It remains to be seen how the company performs in the second quarter. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Motorola Solutions is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below: : The ESP for the company stands at 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. : Motorola Solutions has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, that alone is not sufficient to secure an earnings beat.As a caution, we advise investors not to consider Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.Here is a company you may want to consider as our model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Analog Devices, Inc.  has an earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"Chicago, IL - August 02, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .This earnings season has seen equal excitement in terms of acquisitions as well. Last week, earnings reports were accompanied by new that the Japanese firm Softbank was acquiring British chip designing powerhouse ARM Holdings.This week saw another big announcement in Analog Devices (  ) picking up Linear Technology (  ) , Yahoo (  ) finally accepting Verizon's offer and some speculation of a hostile takeover of Micron. And of course there were the hottest tech earnings from Apple (  ) to Facebook (  ).Here are the top stories- : Apple saw unit declines across all major product lines from iPhones to iPads and Macs although iPad revenues grew possibly because people are upgrading to newer models. It's also likely that people are reluctant to buy new iPhones with the next model just around the corner.At any rate, the iPhone numbers were better than expected, which sent the shares up. Services Apple Music, the App Store, iTunes and iCloud) were a bright spot and now generate more revenue than both iPads and Macs. For more details read:  : The company blew past the Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenue and earnings with the FX impact coming in positive across all segments. The North America and AWS segments were strong contributors to profits while investments in international continued. Operating efficiencies continued in the last quarter and the tax rate also continued to decline.The company promised heavy investments to build out 18 fulfillment centers in the current quarter that will help it cope with the fourth-quarter surge in demand. It continues to take the Prime advantage to new markets. For more details read:  : Almost like clockwork, Facebook comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both top and bottom lines. This time, results were driven by very strong growth in mobile and continued growth in its huge user base.But Facebook isn't satisfied with being the place where practically everyone on the planet socializes on. It has big ambitions to deliver other experiences (and build the social media one as well). After all, there's a limit to the real estate that you can plant ads on and this could curb its future growth. So the company has laid out future growth plans and intends to step up investments in emerging areas like AR/VR, Messenger, WhatsApp and so forth.Since the boards of both companies have signed the deal and turned it over for regulatory approval, Linear Technology may soon become part of Analog Devices. For Linear, the offer of a 24% premium (or $14.8 billion), which will be paid in 58 million new shares and cash (through $7.3 million in fresh debt and Analog's balance sheet cash), was too good to pass up.For Analog Devices, it is an acquisition of products (there is minimal product overlap and some possibility of cross selling), technology (Linear's power conversion products can complement Analog's data conversion capabilities targeting wireless, automotive and industrial customers) and an extremely strong engineering team that it has said it will focus on retaining. Moreover, annual synergies after 18 months are expected to be $150 million.Unrelated to the acquisition, Analog Devices raised its fiscal third-quarter guidance: revenue up from $800 million-$840 million to $865 million and adjusted EPS of $0.77-$0.78, up from prior guidance of $0.66-$0.74.Verizon is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion en route to transforming itself into an Internet company. In 2014, it acquired another ailing Internet giant AOL for $4.4 billion and Yahoo's core assets will be folded into this AOL business. Mayer will continue at Yahoo through the process but it's likely that Tim Armstrong, who heads AOL will take over the combination once the acquisition is complete.Verizon has been buying online properties and will continue doing so to reach more users. With Yahoo, it will reach a billion users and the goal is to double this number by 2020. Advertising and video are two of its focus areas that are expected to help it diversify away from the highly-regulated, low-growth carrier business.The deal will draw the attention of regulators as Verizon's history with law enforcement hasn't been spectacular to date. The company was earlier charged with planting super cookies to track users and passing on their details to advertisers without their consent. But Verizon is determined to collect more data and that's the reason for these acquisitions. It's highly doubtful that it will become the next Google or Facebook, but even capturing a few points of market share will make this a good deal for Verizon.For Yahoo, this is the end of the road for one of the web's pioneers. Hopefully the brand stays, and also some of its popular services.There was renewed speculation about a possible takeover after the board of directors of the company approved a plan to issue one right share for every common share held in the event any individual or group assumed greater than a 5% stake in the company. The rights issue would prevent a hostile takeover of the company, prevent the transfer of control to another party and also enable Micron to continue to use its prior losses to reduce its tax bills.Two names are at the forefront in this respect: the first is China's Tsinghua Unigroup, which earlier offered $23 billion for the company and then backed out when it was thought that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CIFUS) could oppose it on security concerns.The second possibility is Intel Corp because the chipmaker has already partnered with it to develop its 3D XPoint architecture and other technologies. In the event of an acquisition, Intel would get Micron's other memory technology as well, but would also be saddled with its losses.What could happen instead is that both Intel and the Chinese company (or any one of them) could increase investment in the company to gain access to some memory technology to further their own growth goals.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.82%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Model N provides revenue management solutions for the life science and technology industries. It develops applications such as managed care and government pricing for life science companies and channel incentives based on design wins for technology companies.The company reported strong year-over-year growth in revenues (up 14.9%) in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Reported revenues were also in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Coming to the bottom line, although the company posted a loss of 31 cents for the quarter, it was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 36 cents.We are optimistic about the company's strategic acquisitions, product launches and deal wins, which should positively impact fiscal third-quarter results. However, pricing pressure caused by stiff competition from SAP SE  , I-Many Inc. and Symphony Teleca Corp. may impact profitability in the to-be-reported quarter. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Model N is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

 is slated to report second-quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Aug 3.Last quarter, the company posted a massive negative earnings surprise of 400.0%. Also, 3D Systems has had an unimpressive earnings history wherein it missed estimates thrice in the last four quarters, leading to an average negative surprise of 158.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.3D Systems' broad portfolio of healthcare offerings is likely to turn out to be the strongest profit churners for the second quarter of 2016. Leveraging on its core competence in expanding healthcare solutions is one of the company's five-pronged core growth strategies. During first-quarter 2016, revenue from healthcare and related applications increased 12% year over year, driven by the company's extensive offerings, as well as expansion by clients who print medical and dental devices.Particularly, precision healthcare offerings like printers and materials, surgical simulation and planning and printing of devices and tools contributed to growth. This apart, the company's other four growth channels, namely, expansion of quickparts services, accelerating 3D printer penetration through channel expansion, launch of integrated 3D authoring solutions platform and strengthening of partnerships are expected to prove conducive to growth in the soon to be reported quarter.During the second quarter of 2016, 3D Systems released the GibbsCAM 2016 software for production machining and comprehensive 3D scan-to-solidworks software called Geomagic. In addition, the company's operational restructuring initiatives like improving of the sales network as well as undertaking of lean manufacturing initiatives in supply-chain operations are expected to be conducive to results. Also, 3D Systems upped the ante by making some key hires for the quarter and expects them to bolster the company's internal strength in the quarter to be reported and beyond.McMullen, who was serving as the Executive Vice President and CFO at Eastman Kodak Co, has been appointed in the position of Chief Financial Officer while Vyomesh Joshi has been appointed as the President and CEO.. It will be interesting to watch how these veterans manage to turn things for the company which has been experiencing strong headwinds in recent times.Over the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing particularly unfavorable broader market conditions that have hit its financial performance severely. The company has been grappling with macroeconomic headwinds such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability. In the reported quarter, revenues from 3D printing products and services were significantly undermined due to continued challenging market conditions that impacted customers' capital investment cycles and reduced demand across all geographies.The company's product revenues decreased 11% year over year in the reported quarter, due to lower printer sales. Also, cut-throat competition in the industry coupled with factors like escalating research & development and selling & administrative expenses are likely to mar the financials. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that 3D Systems will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. : Earnings ESP for the company currently stands at 0.00%. This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are pegged at a break even. : 3D Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CDK Global Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.26% and a Zacks Rank #1.MKS Instruments, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.6% and a Zacks Rank #1.Analog Devices, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.50%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.TrueCar reported encouraging first-quarter 2016 results with revenues increasing 6% from the year-ago quarter.The company reported a 29% increase in new car franchises with the franchise dealer count (number of new car brands sold by Truecar Certified Dealers) increasing during the quarter.TrueCar witnessed 21% growth in average monthly unique visitors on a year-over-year basis. The number of units grew 4%. Monetization in the quarter also increased marginally from the year-ago quarter.TrueCar's main focus now is to bring in refinements in its marketplace so as to meet the demands of car buyers, dealers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).TrueCar's business model stands on four pillars namely new car transparency model, value proposition and cost per action model, good relationships with affinity partners and a positive image of the brand.The company introduced the Dealer Pledge during the first quarter of 2016 to address the requirements of dealers in a better way.For the second quarter, TrueCar expects revenues of between $64 million and $66 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of ($2 million) to ($3 million). Additionally, it expects units to remain in the range of 185,000 to 190,000.Our proven model does not conclusively show that TrueCar is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients.

etworking giant  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2016 results on Aug 4.This key player in the field of telecommunications has an impressive history with respect to earnings, having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The average earnings beat is 30.21%.Nokia's quarterly performance is expected to benefit from its acquisition of Withings S.A. and synergies from its Alcatel-Lucent takeover. The company's rapid deployment of 4G LTE network across China and the rest of the world along with increasing popularity of Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and the Voice over Wi-Fi services are expected to boost top-line growth. Moreover, the company's decision to expand its licensing agreement with Samsung is encouraging.However, the company is facing challenges in its primary Network segment along with stiff competition from peers such as Cisco Systems, Inc.  and Motorola Solutions Inc.  . Additionally, its global operations expose the company to adverse foreign exchange movements which could affect the bottom line. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Nokia is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.

 (  ) is set to report second-quarter 2016 results on Aug 3. The company is a leading provider of payment processing, point-of-sale (POS), and marketing services worldwide. It completed its initial public offering (IPO) in Nov 2015.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. In the first quarter of 2016, Square's core payments business was strong and witnessed growth. The gross payment volume (GPV) was $10.3 billion, a significant 45% increase on a year-over-year basis. The company's contactless chip reader continues to gain traction in the market for making payments through the phone. In Apr 2016, in a festival at Coachella, Square's contactless payments accounted for more than 10% of the card transactions. Square introduced many innovative products for sellers targeted to grow their business. Square was able to maintain a positive risk trend throughout its entire business segments. It managed to keep the transaction losses related to payment processing as a GPV percentage below its historical average of 0.1%.Square's management is upbeat on the second quarter earnings as it has usually been the strongest quarter on a sequential basis. The company expects adjusted revenues to be anywhere between $151 million to $156 million. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Square will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Most Accurate Estimate stands at a loss of 14 cents, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 11 cents. Hence, the difference is -27.27%. Square has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative 27.27% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:CDK Global, Inc  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.26% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings on Aug 3, 2016.MeetMe, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Blaze and Alta contributed 47% to first-quarter revenues.The company continued with its investments in research and development (R&D) to create more powerful electronics, miniaturized yet fashionable designs, spontaneous user interfaces and engaging social and community features.

"Image source: Getty Images.Despite the  (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and  (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) logging gains on Friday thanks to  rising, both basically traded flat for the week, ending lower by 0.75% and 0.07%, respectively. Investors will take what they can get, though, especially since U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data was disappointing.The U.S. economy grew at a slower pace than expected during the second quarter, recording a meager 1.2% annual growth rate. At the same time, it was announced that first-quarter growth was reduced from the prior estimate of 1.1% down to 0.8%.With that slightly pessimistic news out of the way, let's look at some of the positive events from the week.It was a great week for investors in  (NYSE: S) as the telecom company jumped about 25% on Monday alone, and trended to an even higher 32% gain for the full week. The move higher was due to the company's solid first-quarter results, which boasted revenue that topped analyst expectations, and the highest first-quarter postpaid phone net additions in nine years.More specifically, Sprint announced revenue of $8.01 billion, which was ahead of estimates, but an earnings-per-share loss of $0.08. The earnings-per-share loss was in line with expectations, but investors were optimistic about Sprint's customer trends.The company added 173,000 net postpaid phone customers during the quarter, and also reported its lowest postpaid phone churn in company history, at 1.39%. Further, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said the company was ""postpaid net port positive against all three national carriers after five years.""Management is looking for operating income for fiscal 2016 to check in between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, which is much improved from the $310 million over the trailing 12-month period. It's definitely a step in the right direction for Sprint amid its turnaround efforts, but the near term is still very uncertain, and a 32% jump this week might be a bit premature.Shares of  (NASDAQ: LLTC) also had a very favorable week, trading 25% higher following a Bloomberg report that said  (NASDAQ: ADI) was in extensive talks to buy the company. Bloomberg nailed it, too, as Analog soon agreed to acquire Linear Technology for roughly $14.8 billion.Digging into the details, Analog will pay $60 per share for the company, in cash and stock, which was a 24% premium to its closing price on Monday. The transaction should officially close by the first half of 2017. To fund the move, Analog plans to issue 58 million new shares, and $7.3 billion of new long-term debt.It's a smart move for Analog as the company tries to grow its size, and scale to better compete with the industry leader,  . Analog specializes in data converters and chips that help translate human interactions, like pressing a button, into electronic signals, and this acquisition will give it access to chips that control power in devices.Ultimately, this is just another domino falling in the semiconductor industry, which had mergers at a record pace last year.We can't have an optimistic market wrap-up without mentioning  (NASDAQ: FB) impressive quarter. The company easily topped all expectations with strong ad-revenue and user growth.The social-networking leader posted total advertising revenue growth of 63% compared to the prior year, to $6.2 billion. That was pushed higher thanks to a 15% and 17% increase in monthly average users (MAUs), and daily active users (DAUs), respectively.Looking at regions, Facebook's ad revenue grew 69% compared to the prior year in the U.S. and Canada regions, as well as 67% in Asia. There was good news on the mobile front, too. Facebook's mobile users increased by 20% from the prior year, which pushed mobile revenue to represent 84% of total ad revenue.Further, operating margins expanded, gross margin moved higher, and operating expenses declined as a percentage of revenue. It would be difficult to find anything negative in Facebook's financials during the quarter.However, management noted that it expects deceleration in the top-line growth during the back half of 2016, and possibly 2017. But still, that's one heck of a second quarter.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

"his earnings season has seen equal excitement in terms of acquisitions as well. Last week, earnings reports were accompanied by new that the Japanese firm Softbank was acquiring British chip designing powerhouse ARM Holdings.This week saw another big announcement in Analog Devices  picking up Linear Technology  , Yahoo  finally accepting Verizon's offer and some speculation of a hostile takeover of Micron. And of course there were the hottest tech earnings from Apple  , Alphabet  , Amazon  , Facebook  , Twitter, Groupon  and so on.Here are the top stories- : Apple saw unit declines across all major product lines from iPhones to iPads and Macs although iPad revenues grew possibly because people are upgrading to newer models. It's also likely that people are reluctant to buy new iPhones with the next model just around the corner.At any rate, the iPhone numbers were better than expected, which sent the shares up. Services Apple Music, the App Store, iTunes and iCloud) were a bright spot and now generate more revenue than both iPads and Macs. For more details read:  : Alphabet's revenue and earnings topped estimates. The FX impact on revenue was negative on a year on year basis. The Google segment constituted substantially all of the business with Mobile and YouTube remaining strong drivers.Google continues to sacrifice prices for volume, which helped it grow the advertising business. Nest, Fiber and Verily contributed to Other Bets revenue. For more details read:  : The company blew past the Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenue and earnings with the FX impact coming in positive across all segments. The North America and AWS segments were strong contributors to profits while investments in international continued. Operating efficiencies continued in the last quarter and the tax rate also continued to decline.The company promised heavy investments to build out 18 fulfillment centers in the current quarter that will help it cope with the fourth-quarter surge in demand. It continues to take the Prime advantage to new markets. For more details read:  : Almost like clockwork, Facebook comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both top and bottom lines. This time, results were driven by very strong growth in mobile and continued growth in its huge user base.But Facebook isn't satisfied with being the place where practically everyone on the planet socializes on. It has big ambitions to deliver other experiences (and build the social media one as well). After all, there's a limit to the real estate that you can plant ads on and this could curb its future growth. So the company has laid out future growth plans and intends to step up investments in emerging areas like AR/VR, Messenger, WhatsApp and so forth. For more details read:  : The company reported another very strong quarter with margins continuing to expand significantly from the year-ago quarter. TI as it is better known, has moved away from the fast-growing (or in other words erratic) consumer electronics market for deep focus on automotive, industrial and communications markets.Current R&D efforts are focused on very long-term analog and embedded processing solutions for these markets that will help the company to continue filling up its advanced, cost-efficient fabs thereby driving up its margins. For more details read:  : Twitter shares plunged 11% following disappointing second quarter results and third-quarter guidance. It appears that all the efforts of current management to bring back users haven't yet yielded the desired results because user growth was again sluggish. For more details read: Since the boards of both companies have signed the deal and turned it over for regulatory approval, Linear Technology may soon become part of Analog Devices. For Linear, the offer of a 24% premium (or $14.8 billion), which will be paid in 58 million new shares and cash (through $7.3 million in fresh debt and Analog's balance sheet cash), was too good to pass up.For Analog Devices, it is an acquisition of products (there is minimal product overlap and some possibility of cross selling), technology (Linear's power conversion products can complement Analog's data conversion capabilities targeting wireless, automotive and industrial customers) and an extremely strong engineering team that it has said it will focus on retaining. Moreover, annual synergies after 18 months are expected to be $150 million.Unrelated to the acquisition, Analog Devices raised its fiscal third-quarter guidance: revenue up from $800 million-$840 million to $865 million and adjusted EPS of $0.77-$0.78, up from prior guidance of $0.66-$0.74.Verizon is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion en route to transforming itself into an Internet company. In 2014, it acquired another ailing Internet giant AOL for $4.4 billion and Yahoo's core assets will be folded into this AOL business. Mayer will continue at Yahoo through the process but it's likely that Tim Armstrong, who heads AOL will take over the combination once the acquisition is complete.Verizon has been buying online properties and will continue doing so to reach more users. With Yahoo, it will reach a billion users and the goal is to double this number by 2020. Advertising and video are two of its focus areas that are expected to help it diversify away from the highly-regulated, low-growth carrier business.The deal will draw the attention of regulators as Verizon's history with law enforcement hasn't been spectacular to date. The company was earlier charged with planting super cookies to track users and passing on their details to advertisers without their consent. But Verizon is determined to collect more data and that's the reason for these acquisitions. It's highly doubtful that it will become the next Google or Facebook, but even capturing a few points of market share will make this a good deal for Verizon.For Yahoo, this is the end of the road for one of the web's pioneers. Hopefully the brand stays, and also some of its popular services.There was renewed speculation about a possible takeover after the board of directors of the company approved a plan to issue one right share for every common share held in the event any individual or group assumed greater than a 5% stake in the company. The rights issue would prevent a hostile takeover of the company, prevent the transfer of control to another party and also enable Micron to continue to use its prior losses to reduce its tax bills.Two names are at the forefront in this respect: the first is China's Tsinghua Unigroup, which earlier offered $23 billion for the company and then backed out when it was thought that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CIFUS) could oppose it on security concerns.The second possibility is Intel Corp because the chipmaker has already partnered with it to develop its 3D XPoint architecture and other technologies. In the event of an acquisition, Intel would get Micron's other memory technology as well, but would also be saddled with its losses.What could happen instead is that both Intel and the Chinese company (or any one of them) could increase investment in the company to gain access to some memory technology to further their own growth goals.
  
Other stories you might have missed- : Google's new HR head Eileen Naughton, previously VP of sales and operations for Google in the UK and Ireland, will report directly to CFO Ruth Porat. She joined Google in 2005 after a stint as President of Time Magazine. She will be in charge of recruiting, benefits and diversity globally for Google's 64K employees but not for Alphabet's other endeavors. : Amazon's Launchpad store is making room for a little addition. It's a kickstarter store with a difference: the companies that have raised funds through Kickstarter and created successful products will now get to customers through two-day Prime shipping. Startups generally have plenty of problems to deal with from manufacture to sales to after-market service andAmazon is now saying that reaching customers is not going to be one of them. Some of the things currently on offer are Pebble smartwatches, Oculus Rifts, Petcube dog cameras, Zackee's turning signal LED gloves for cyclists and Olloclip's detachable iPhone lenses. : Under pressure from activist investor Corvex Management LP (with 9.9% stake in the company), Pandora has hired Centerview Partners LLC to advise it on a possible sale. While talks are reportedly in initial stages, Liberty Media has made an informal offer to buy Pandora for $15 a share. The board would like $20. Morgan Stanley is already an advisor since February, so this is the second advisor. : In the next chapter of the transfer of its global operations to Ireland, the IRS has served a notice of deficiency for $3 billion to $5 billion, plus interest and penalties. The problem seems to be that Facebook's tax adviser Ernst & Young LLP undervalued the company's property in its transfer to Facebook Ireland Holdings Ltd. by evaluating pieces of the online platform separately. Facebook will likely have to cough up some cash (if not the amount the IRS is claiming) in case it's found guilty. :Brazil continues to penalize Facebook for not providing data on people charged with crimes. The platform being questioned is WhatsApp, where Facebook has enabled end-to-end encryption. Last week, the authorities froze 38 million reais ($11.7 million) held in a Brazilian Facebook account for non-compliance with a court order asking for the information. : In one of its biggest pushes to boost demand for the Occulus Rift, Facebook released on GitHub the blueprints to build the Surround 360 degree Camera as well as the software required to stitch the video together for the 360 degree immersive experience. Off-the-shelf parts will add up to $30K, compared to $15K for the GoPro Odyssey or $60K for the Nokia Ozo. Facebook is betting that if more professional videographers start shooting in VR, demand for VR content will rise and what could be better for its $599 Rift, which started selling in March this year? : Soon after the announced sale of the business to Verizon, Tumblr has announced that it will be serving ads on nearly all blogs. While the blog owner can opt out of it, this may not happen since it is a way for the bloggers to make some more money (and Yahoo/Verizon too of course). The Tumblr community has resisted ads since Yahoo bought it, but alternative methods of monetization haven't materialized with the company finally writing down its billion dollar valuation by $230 million. So ads it is. : Microsoft's Pix app for the iPhone uses artificial intelligence to identify the best settings for exposure, focus and time (down to the exact second) to take a photo. Another interesting feature is, it automatically takes pictures in burst mode, i.e. in a series and uses facial recognition technology to choose the best one. So don't worry if your eyes close at just the wrong moment! : Google has made some cosmetic changes to its popular Maps app to make it easier on the eyes. It has removed road lines and started using color code to mark areas of high activity (points of interest), where bars, restaurants and shops are more easily available. Google uses an algorithmic process to find such regions and marks them a pale orange. There's also a color code to mark regions with schools and hospitals. Typography for street names, points of interest, etc now appears larger. The changes are already available on iOS and Android. : Former Googlers in China formed a company called Mobvoi that Google invested in the last round of funding in October. That company is now getting ready to launch a $200 smartwatch called Ticwatch to take on Apple's Watch in China. The CEO of the startup expects to sell 50K devices within a year of its U.S. debut and reach total revenue of $100 million in 2017. : Western Digital has announced its next generation 3D NAND technology called BiCS3, claiming 64 layers of vertical storage capability. The company has started pilot production at its Yokkaichi, Japan JV facilities with the first lot of devices expected later this year. Western Digital expects to ship meaningful commercial volumes of BiCS3 in the first half of calendar 2017. : Apple's agreement with the parking services company will integrate the service directly into Apple maps so users can look for parking garages and lots along with details about the payment type, number of spaces, etc. They can also click on the link to book a spot rightaway (the payment is currently being completed on the Parkopedia website and not Apple Maps). Parkopedia covers 40 million parking spots in 75 countries across North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America, so this is a nice enhancement to the Apple service. : At an employee meeting last week, Tim Cook said ""iPhone has become one of the most important, world-changing and successful products in history…It's become more than a constant companion. iPhone is truly an essential part of our daily life and enables much of what we do throughout the day. Last week we passed another major milestone when we sold the billionth iPhone. We never set out to make the most, but we've always set out to make the best products that make a difference.

"Image source: Linear Technology.As if last quarter's return to sequential top- and bottom-line growth wasn't enough,  (NASDAQ: LLTC) repeated the feat with its fiscal fourth-quarter 2016 results Tuesday after the market close. But the biggest news of the day is a now-confirmed  that Linear Technology has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by  (NASDAQ: ADI) in a deal valuing Linear at a whopping $14.8 billion.Before we get to the big acquisition, however, let's take a closer look at what Linear Technology achieved in its latest quarter:YOY = year over year. Data source: Linear Technology.""We met the midpoint of our revenue guidance with growth of 3.5% sequentially over the March quarter,"" elaborated Linear Technology CEO Lothar Maier. ""We are pleased that we have bounced back with three sequential quarters of revenue growth after suffering a significant decline in the first fiscal quarter.""As Bob Swanson, Linear Technology's executive chairman and co-founder, said about the merger agreement:Because of its impending transaction with Analog Devices, Linear Technology has opted  to offer financial guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2017 or any future periods. That's fair enough considering the announcement effectively pushed shares of Linear Technology to levels not seen in more than a decade -- and this after more than two years of watching the share price stagnate. With that in mind, it seems fair to say Linear Technology shareholders have plenty of reason to celebrate today.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

(NASDAQ:  ) is reportedly looking to buy the company in a deal that would combine the talents of both industry veterans.It is still unclear how much Linear Tech will shell out for Analog Devices.

anta Clara, CA-based  is set to report second-quarter 2016 on Aug 1,  .Last quarter, the company had posted in-line results. Notably, Chegg surpassed estimates in three out of the past four quarters with an average positive surprise of 102.29%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.As a student-first connected learning platform Chegg has two revenue streams - digital and print. Interestingly, Chegg started the process of transitioning into an all-digital business through its textbook partnership with Ingram during the first quarter. This is expected to boost enrollment in the to-be-reported quarter as modern students are more comfortable with online tuition than the traditional form.Further, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Chegg had undertaken an initiative to respond to 85% of students requesting for a tutor within five minutes. This increased the number of students as well as tutors in the first quarter 2016 and the trend is expected to continue in the second quarter as well. | However, the company has incurred losses in the last few quarters and the trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, its transformation into an all-digital business may result in higher costs, which in turn, may adversely affect margins in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Chegg is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at a loss of 9 cents. Chegg currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, a 0.00 ESP makes prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies in the wider computer and technology sector that can be considered as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +5.41% and a Zacks Rank #3.Digital Turbine Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #3.CDK Global Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +4.26% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend Fund ETF (Symbol: DLN), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $79.68 per unit.With DLN trading at a recent price near $72.37 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.09% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DLN's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Host Hotels & Resorts Inc (Symbol: HST), Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI), and D.R. Horton Inc. (Symbol: DHI). Although HST has traded at a recent price of $14.79/share, the average analyst target is 14.63% higher at $16.95/share. Similarly, ADI has 14.18% upside from the recent share price of $52.55 if the average analyst target price of $60.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DHI to reach a target price of $33.65/share, which is 14.15% above the recent price of $29.48.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

 or TI recently launched a new isolated amplifier, AMC1301, capable of delivering accurate current control measurement in high-voltage equipment.TI's new amplifier, AMC1301, is equipped with an isolated barrier that separates output from the input circuitry and is highly resistant to magnetic interference. According to VDE V 0884-10 and UL1577T, this barrier is certified to provide reinforced galvanic isolation of up to 7 kVPEAK.AMC1301 is optimized for current measurement in high-voltage equipment such as industrial motor drives, solar inverters, battery management systems and uninterruptible power supplies, wherein voltage specifications are crucial.TI's new amplifier is specified over the industrial temperature range of -40°C to 125°C and is available in a wide-body, 8-pin SOIC package. The device comes with ±250 mV input voltage range, lowest offset drift of 3 uV/C and at a fixed gain of 8.2. All these features facilitate accurate current control, lowest power consumption, highest reliability, longer lifespan and highest DC accuracy. | TI's increasing focus on new products should generate solid returns. The company's diverse portfolio targeting different market segments such as smart grid, factory automation, high-voltage power, LED lighting and control are also positives for its future revenue growth.The launch will enhance Texas Instruments' differentiated product pipeline and is expected to improve its market share. However, Texas Instruments operates in an intensely competitive industry and companies such as Analog Devices  give stiff competition.In the last reported first quarter, TI reported earnings of 65 cents that easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. Revenues of $3.01 billion were down 5.7% sequentially and down 4.5% year over year (within the guidance range of $3.07 billion and $3.33 billion).The company is slated to report its second-quarter 2016 results on Jul 25.Texas Instruments currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"In just 20 days, (NYSE: GLW) stock is slated to report its fiscal Q2 2016 earnings. One analyst isn't waiting around for the good news, however.Sales of  's(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone are in trouble -- and that could spell bigger trouble for Apple's suppliers.That's the upshot of a new report out of tech analysts at Pacific Crest this morning, as they take a shotgun to the iPhone supply stream, downgrading stocks and slashing price targets across the board. As reported on  Monday, Pacific Crest's ""quarterly Asia supply chain findings left us incrementally more positive on"" only a handful of smartphone component suppliers -- and very negative on the supply chain at large.The analyst blames ""concerns"" over the upcoming iPhone 7 release for its worries, and laid out a who's-who list for the whole industry, alleging everyone from  (NASDAQ: ADI) to  (NASDAQ: CRUS) ,  (NASDAQ: SWKS) , and  (NASDAQ: TXN) could be at risk.Here are three things you should know.iPhone prices are getting smaller. Sales could be getting smaller, too. Image source:  .Suffering the brunt of Pacific Crest's criticism this morning are Cirrus Logic and Skyworks Solutions. Cirrus supplies audio integrated circuits on the iPhone 6S. Skyworks supplies at least two power amplifiers for the device. Both stocks got their ratings cut from overweight to sector weight -- the equivalent of a cut from buy to hold.Collateral damage hit iPhone suppliers Analog Devices and Texas Instruments. While not downgraded per se, both stocks got their earnings estimates cut by Pacific Crest due to their heavy reliance on Apple for revenue. Pacific Crest singled out Texas Instruments as particularly at risk for depending on Apple orders to contribute more than 10% of its annual revenues. The analyst went one step farther on Analog Devices, cutting its price target from $62 a share to $60.So what is it, specifically, that has Pacific Crest so worried? StreetInsider says it's a problem with ""weaker-than expected iPhone 7 demand forecasts in the supply chain."" A related report this morning on  goes on to explain that Pacific Crest has interpreted its findings from the supply chain, to guess that Apple is expecting to see ""a 15%-20% decline in iPhone 7 shipments in the second half of 2016.""Now the iPhone 7 hasn't actually been released yet -- that's not expected to happen  . Obviously, Pacific Crest can't mean it's expecting a 15% to 20% decline in  shipments. More likely, it's talking about a decline in shipments of the iPhone 7 relative to past shipments of iPhones. So how bad of a decline could we be looking at?Well, through the first three quarters of 2015, Apple was selling iPhones of all shapes and sizes at the rate of just over 60 million units per quarter. Q4 shipments surged, as you'd expect them to in the Christmas shopping season, and notched a record sales quarter of 74.8 million iPhones sold. If Pacific Crest is right about the impending sales decline reaching as high as 20%, therefore, Q4 2016 could see iPhone 7 shipments fall below 60 million. That number would be well below the average number of units shipped across all quarters last year -- and it could happen in the strongest sales season of the year.So you see why Pacific Crest is nervous. Should investors be nervous, too? And if so, about which stocks?Let's look at the numbers. Right now, Cirrus Logic stock, subject of one of Pacific Crest's actual downgrades, is selling for 20.3 times trailing earnings. Analyst projections currently anticipate that the stock will grow earnings at just under 12% annually over the next five years. Accordingly, the stock's 1.7  ratio puts it well into danger territory.Skyworks Solutions, on the other hand, costs only 12.2 times earnings, and is pegged for 17% growth. That suggests that even if Pacific Crest is right about iPhone sales turning down, Skyworks stock is more defensively priced. (There is, however, some concern to be found on the stock's cash flow statement. According to data from  , Skyworks Solutions generated less than $0.58 in real free cash flow for every $1 in claimed ""net earnings"" over the past 12 months. Cheap as the stock may appear on the surface, it may not be quite as cheap as it looks.)Meanwhile, Analog Devices, priced at 27.5 times earnings and pegged for just single-digit growth, looks significantly more overpriced than either of the stocks that actually received downgrade"" this morning. Likewise, see Texas Instruments at 21.7 times earnings and a 10% projected growth rate. If Pacific Crest is right at all about the iPhone sales decline -- it's almost certainly right to be leery of these two stocks.Long story short? I see plenty of reasons to worry about all four of these stocks -- whether Pacific Crest is right about iPhone sales being about to crater, or not. Investors would be well advised to heed the analyst's warning: With high prices and a high level of dependence on one customer for their profits, this is an industry setting itself up for a fall.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

"n recent weeks,  (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has been buffeted by increasingly alarmist reports about the outlook for iPhone sales.iPhone sales have missed expectations this year. Image source: Apple.The iPhone 6s product cycle has already proven to be a disappointment. iPhone unit sales fell 16% year over year last quarter, and Apple's guidance for the current quarter implies that another double-digit decline is probably on the way. Now, some media outlets are suggesting that iPhone sales will continue to sink even after the iPhone 7 hits the market this fall.However, these reports -- which are based on supply chain leaks -- don't pass the sniff test. It's way too early for Apple's suppliers to know how many iPhones Apple expects to build this fall, let alone how many it will actually sell.Earlier this month, the  reported that iPhone suppliers in Taiwan expect to get significantly fewer orders in the second half of 2016 than they got a year earlier. For chip foundry giant  , the article claimed that A10 processor shipments would be  than its A9 shipments last year. Moreover, TSMC is set to be the sole A10 supplier this year, whereas Samsung got some of Apple's chip orders last year.This would imply that Apple is expecting a massive decline in iPhone sales: on the order of a 40% to 50% drop. This simply isn't credible. First, even the struggling iPad product line has never posted a sales decline of that magnitude -- and iPhone upgrade demand is much more predictable.Second, Apple CEO Tim Cook was upbeat about the iPhone business on Apple's  last month. He wouldn't have taken such a bullish tone if he expected sales to crash and burn later this year, as he will face a massive backlash if iPhone sales declines accelerate in the next few quarters.Instead, these reports seem to be a case of people reading too much into a limited slice of supply chain data. Cook has repeatedly warned analysts and reporters about the dangers of doing that. Nevertheless, some Wall Street analysts appear to be taking the  report at face value. '(NASDAQ: ADI) recent earnings report provides a more plausible explanation for what's going on here. Analog Devices, a major Apple supplier, reported that revenue fell 5% last quarter and expects a similar decline of about 5% this quarter.Analysts initially took this news as another sign that Apple is expecting weak demand for the iPhone 7. However, on Analog Devices' , CFO Dave Zinsner suggested that the projected decline has to do with the timing of Apple's chip orders.Analog Devices doesn't expect iPhone 7-related production to pick up until July, the last month of its fiscal third quarter. That means the peak demand from Apple will fall into the following quarter.More broadly, this suggests that other suppliers probably don't know Apple's true expectations around iPhone 7 demand. Furthermore, Apple itself doesn't know how much demand there will be. A lot will depend on how many iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users decide to upgrade this fall.iPhone 7 sales will depend heavily on how many iPhone 6 users upgrade. Image source: Apple.Apple probably wants to maintain as much flexibility on inventory as possible this year, given that demand hasn't lived up to its expectations in the past six months or so. In that context, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple starts with fewer orders than it did last year. It can then put in more orders after it has a chance to assess initial demand levels in September.Supply chain data can be useful for assessing iPhone sales trends. It's an early indicator of short-term demand fluctuations, albeit an imprecise signal. Supply chain rumors did correctly forecast the current iPhone sales slump.However, supply chain rumors aren't likely to produce good predictions of longer-term iPhone sales trends. The recent  report projecting a massive sales decline will likely go down as one of the more egregious examples of this problem.

Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expenses.Analog Devices generated revenues of $778.8 million, up 1.2% sequentially but down 5.1% year over year. The year-over-year decline was due to significant weakness in the consumer market, especially the consumer portable segment.

It accounted for 10% of total revenue.Pro-forma gross margin was 65.8%, down 360 basis points (bps) sequentially and 70 bps year over year. The decline was primarily due to higher inventory reserves and lower utilization rates.Analog Devices reported adjusted operating expenses of $284.8 million, up 7.6% sequentially and 5.7% year over year.

 is set to report second quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 18. Last quarter, the company posted a 5.66% positive earnings surprise.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices delivered decent first quarter results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top line and the bottom line. However, the consumer segment was weak.Though the company expects industrial, auto and communication market revenues to be up in mid-to-high single digits in the fiscal second quarter, it expects the consumer market to remain weak.In 2015, the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded the available opportunities. It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting 2017.The company is investing heavily in the health sector and working with several of the world's leading research institutions and system OEMs to improve performance, impact and affordability of medical electronics devices. Primary focus areas within this segment include care-imaging applications and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring.While the investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, management expects sequential revenue growth in the range of (2%) to 4%. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 65.5% and earnings per share of 58-66 cents.On a GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of 65.3% and earnings per share in a range of 52-60 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 62 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Analog Devices' Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:TiVo Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +25.00% and Zacks Rank #1Intuit Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and Zacks Rank #2Casey's General Stores, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.84% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.68), with the stock changing hands as low as $55.89 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices, Inc., looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, ADI makes up 4.79% of the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSI) which is trading lower by about 3.2% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices (ADI) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2016-04-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-adi-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2016-04-29
"ast week, which was light in terms of tech earnings, saw a number of negative reports on Nikkei that pulled down Apple shares. At the same time Alphabet  and Oracle  found themselves heading to court again.Here are the top stories-Back-to-back negative reports from the Nikkei impacted Apple shares last week. The first of these mentioned falling iPhone shipments based on estimates from IHS, smartphone part makers and manufacturing equipment makers, all of which see increasing demand for cheaper Chinese smartphones from Huawei, Xiaomi, Lenovo, ZTE, Vivo, etc. While Huawei is currently expected to be the biggest gainer (to grow 20-30% this year), the top 10 Chinese smartphone makers are together expected to grow 15% to 550 million.The other reports focused on weak sales of Apple component suppliers and measures taken by Japanese and Taiwanese part makers to target Chinese phone makers. Since Apple is already dealing with its first quarter of shipment decline, the Nikkei reports had more of a negative impact.Oracle lawyer Peter Bicks says that Alphabet's Google made $42 billion in revenue and $21 billion in profits from Android-based smartphones and is therefore seeking $8.8 billion in damages, or around 11.7% of its balance sheet cash. It's a huge amount even for Google, but it's as yet unclear if Google will have to pay for it. Google used 37 application programming interfaces (APIs, or software code that enables interoperability between programs) that belonged to Sun, which was subsequently taken over by Oracle.The last time the case was tried, the court held that the technology wasn't copyrightable. Moreover, Google argued that the inability to use APIs and making them negotiable and licensable, especially in the given circumstances (such as Sun encouraging Java use to ensure its proliferation) would limit innovation. App and hardware makers building on Android would also be affected and there would be cost escalation for all.HP, Red Hat and Yahoo submitted papers supporting Google while Microsoft, EMC and NetApp sided with Oracle at the time. Both sides argued for innovation. Microsoft said that failure to protect APIs would lead software makers to reveal less about them, which would in turn affect innovation.But that was a long time ago. Oracle now says it has numbers to support its claims. Google of course doesn't make anything from Android but from software it has developed on it that people use to search, download apps, etc. It doesn't even sell those, earning only from the ads and commissions they generate.So after Google was granted victory in 2012, the decision was overturned on appeal, when Google asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. When they refused, the case went for retrial. Now there's a jury of 8 women and 2 men to decide Google's fate.
  
Other stories you might have missed- : Confirming earlier reports about possible iPhone manufacturing in India, last week saw a fresh report from ET saying that Apple supplier Foxconn was ready to sign a contract for a $10 billion facility covering 1200 acres in India's Maharashtra state. Apple's plans of selling refurbished phones in the country were hit by regulatory authorities on account of competitive concerns.A manufacturing facility in the country aligns with the government's plans of creating 6 million manufacturing jobs through the ""Make in India"" initiative. If Apple resorts to India-only prices as this facility might enable and as manufacturers in other industries already do, it has a much better chance of tapping the Indian market where the average smartphone costs around $150. : Apple's supplier of choice is Taiwan Semiconductor, which has reportedly started taping out the design for its 10nm A11 chip. It's currently expected that the chips will be qualified by the end of the year with samples shipping in the first quarter of 2017. It was earlier thought that Taiwan Semiconductor would secure an exclusive contract, which made sense since it is more focused on developing leading edge technology that Apple can make use of in the future. But it now appears that Samsung is likely to get a quarter share of orders. : 27 Swedish broadcasters, publishers and media associations have objected to Facebook's deal with partly state-owned telecom Telia. The deal offers Facebook to customers without charging them for the data used. The concept hasn't been popular in a number of places, most notably India where it was objected to on the grounds of net neutrality. Swedish companies are objecting on the same grounds. : Intel refinanced some debt that matures this year and in 2017. It sold $2.75 billion in bonds with five, ten and thirty-year maturities and carrying an S&P rating of A+. The 30-year part is the biggest one through which it raised $1.25 billion at 1.55%. The company will also repay $1.5 billion of its 1.95% percent notes due in October and a portion of the 1.35% notes due next year. : News reports last week said that the Yahoo Mail and Google appspot.com had been banned in the lower house of Congress on security concerns. In Yahoo's case, it was because the mail was allowing ransomware attacks, in which hackers attach malicious software to emails. In Google's case, it was because appspot continues to host remote access tools that were capable of stealing personally identifiable information and a trojan named BLT. The FBI issued warnings on these in June 2015. : Microsoft has announced that its Canadian cloud is now open for operation. This is a big deal because it allows businesses and governments to store their data within the country while using Microsoft solutions such as its IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and hybrid platforms. Microsoft has said that Office 365 is already available for data residency and Dynamics CRM is coming in September. : Alibaba's entry into the Washington DC-based International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC) last month has ruffled many. Gucci and Michael Kors already quit the lobby group in protest and last week saw an anonymous letter to the board that there would be mass exits unless Alibaba was ousted. The relationship between IACC President Robert Barchiesi (who has held Alibaba shares since its IPO) and Matthew Bassiur (who took over as Alibaba's head of intellectual property enforcement this January) has also been called into question.China's leading ecommerce company has battled with counterfeits on its Taobao platform for long and many brands are unhappy with its limited success. Taobao has announced fresh rules to crack down on counterfeit items including new requirements for luxury goods sellers that require them to upload proof of authentic goods by May 20, failing which they can have their fund balances frozen. : Following the approval of the Ministry of Commerce of China (MOFCOM), the deal, which was already approved by other regulatory bodies and company shareholders, came to a close. Western Digital, which specializes in HDDs and San Disk, which specializes in the new age NVM are perfectly complementary to each other with broad product and industry experience. So the acquisition is a boon for shareholders. SanDisk co-founder, President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra joins the Western Digital board of directors. Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan continues as CEO of the combined company. : Facebook has been anonymously accused of suppressing news stories that offer a conservative view point. Zuckerberg said an investigation was in progress although there was no evidence of this happening and that he would meet conservative leaders through the week. Facebook also confirmed that it will remain a sponsor of the GOP's July convention in Cleveland despite pressure from liberal activists. Separately, U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul S. Grewal has left the bench to become global litigation head at Facebook. : A new report from Politico indicates that Alphabet's Google is in for some fresh investigation into its search practices. The report says that the investigation is in its early stages, so details are limited. But the idea is to see if Google has misused its dominant position in search to favor its own products. A previous investigation found it not guilty back in 2013.Both search and Android OS are being scrutinized by European authorities. The British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that Google was looking at a fine of up to $3.4 billion (or up to 10% of its annual sales) plus a ban on favoring itself over rivals in search but that the bill had not been finalized. : Groupon has sued IBM in Chicago district court for infringing on its software patent. Specifically, Groupon alleges that IBM's WebSphere Commerce platform infringes on a patent that Groupon holds. This follows IBM's suing the company for infringement of four of its patents, which said that Groupon's lawsuit is without merit. : Possibly in order to better target business users, WhatsApp has now spread to Macs and PCs. The app is now available on the broadest range of operating systems including iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows and has the reach of other leading messaging services, such as iMessage and Skype. Facebook Messenger is close on its heels with apps for mobile, web and as a Windows 8 or 10 app. : Business Insider reports that India comes first as far as Facebook At Work adoption is concerned and says that it's because of its high mobile dependence. Users can typically toggle between their personal and official accounts, with Facebook serving ads on the first one and giving companies total control over the other one which is ad-free. First users are happy with the product calling out its intuitive feature. : Microsoft is courting corporate technology buyers by allowing them to make bulk purchases of third party apps from its Windows Store for Business launched last November. While there's no incentive yet, volume discounts are reportedly on the way.That's not all -- it is removing the option to block the purchase of apps using Windows 10 Pro devices. This is a cheaper version of its OS, usually used by SMBs. If the IT departments want greater control over company devices, they have to upgrade to its pricier product. All this is expected to interest developers to make more apps for Windows, which is absolutely necessary if it is to succeed against Android and iOS. : Google has a developers' conference this week where we might learn more about a new device along the lines of Amazon's popular Echo. Re/code's Mark Bergen says the device will be called Chirp and is in all probability being developed by its Nest group. Nest has some earlier success with smart thermostats and security cameras and has something of a cool design team. So we should get ready for a smart device answering questions, fetching mail, turning on music, etc but hopefully Google will think of a sexier name than OK Google. : Amazon has launched a YouTube killer/competitor called Amazon Video Direct that will live on user-generated content the way YouTube does. But Amazon may get it to profit sooner since it can advertize the millions of items it sells on the platform. It also has a fairly large and loyal user base that it feeds through Prime, so uptake could be quick. Just how Amazon hopes to tie this in with the rest of what it does isnt something it's talking about yet, but the possibilities are exciting.Also, note that Amazon has some fairly successful original content that sets it apart from other video providers except Netflix. Still, YouTube has many more years of experience in video distribution and also has brand value, so it should be a good fight. : Salesforce will build its IoT cloud on AWS according to the WSJ. This is a big win for Amazon, which also recently helped Netflix move to its cloud. While Amazon remains the largest online retailer with significant growth prospects, all the excitement in recent times has been about AWS.Its cloud infrastructure business, while making a single-digit contribution to revenue, generates nearly half its profit. Note that Salesforce's flagship CRM offering competes with Microsoft's Dynamics CRM. Microsoft is second in the IaaS segment, so Amazon (the market leader) is the best company it could have gone to. : Apple has invested a billion dollars in Chinese ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology. Company president Jean Liu has said that the two companies would ""benefit each other on product, on technology, on many other levels,"" but no other details are available.Apple's only known interest in cars is with respect to its autonomous/electric car technology, which is another secret project with few details available. It's extremely hard to understand Apple's move here. If it had been a manufacturing alliance, Apple would have tied with car makers, instead its tied with technology companies. SO Didi could be interested in using these cars when they become available. This could be a goal of the Chinese government as well as it moves to reduce China's carbon footprint. : Alibaba and Softbank have formed a joint venture (called SB Cloud) to offer cloud services in Japan. Softbank's goal is to develop the perfect cloud for Japanese companies and multinationals with data residency in Japan. Alibaba brings its secure, scalable cloud computing technology to the JV so the companies can deliver data storage and processing services, enterprise-level middleware and cloud security services. : Micron said it was expecting a third quarter loss of 5-12 cents per share on revenue of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Analysts expect Micron to report a loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of $3.2 billion. The softness at Micron is because it is focused on memory chips for the PC market where prices continue to slide. The company does have new products in the pipeline, but they aren't expected to make a contribution yet. :  ,  ,  ,  ,  :  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , CRM, SNPSWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

" 's Google recently launched the second developer preview for Android N, the newest version of its mobile operating system. The changes in the OS, which will be officially launched later this year, reveal a lot about Google's mobile strategy and how it will widen its moat against rivals like  and  . Let's discuss the three key changes which could matter the most to tech investors.Image source: Pixabay. Android N will let developers create apps which work in split-screen environments on phones and tablets. It also offers a desktop-style ""freeform"" mode which enables apps to be freely moved around in individual windows with mouse support. Both features make Android look and feel more like Windows, and were clearly added with bigger productivity tablets and 2-in-1 devices in mind.Google is doing this because Microsoft's Surface and its 2-in-1 followers dominate a rapidly growing niche between the sluggish tablet and laptop markets. Research firm IDC estimates that the  share of all Windows tablets (slate and 2-in-1s) could  from 8.4% in 2015 to 17.5% in 2019.Google launched the Pixel C 2-in-1 Android device last year to tap into that growth, but it fared poorly against Microsoft's Surface 3 in most reviews.  launched the iPad Pro for the same reason, but the jury's still out on whether or not it can compete as a productivity device. By adding split-screens and multi-window displays to Android N, Google likely hopes that it can throttle Microsoft's growth in 2-in-1s and gain a foothold in the enterprise market. It also complements its long-rumored plan to merge Chrome OS and Android into a single operating system.Google's Pixel C. Image source: Google. Android N also adds support for pressure-sensitive screens, similar to Apple's ""3D Touch"" feature in the iPhone 6s. The OS already features special app and menu launching options which react based on how hard a user touches the screen. This means that the next generation of Android devices and apps should tap into that feature, and we could see more cross-platform iOS and Android apps with ""3D Touch.""This could be good news for  , which supplies Apple with the microcontroller that controls the 3D Touch display. Orders from Apple helped Analog's consumer electronics unit post triple-digit year-over-year sales growth in the last two quarters of 2015, however those gains have started fading this year due to slowing orders of iPhones. But if Android OEMs also buy microcontrollers from Analog to add pressure-sensitive screens, sales could soar again. Google has already ventured into virtual reality with Cardboard apps and 360-degree YouTube videos, and Android N will add even tighter support for VR apps. The preview contains references to ""VR Listener"" and ""VR Helper"" apps, which will likely automatically optimize a smartphone when it is being used in a VR headset. The OS also includes a permissions warning stating that an app can run while "" using applications in virtual reality mode"" -- indicating that Google expects more VR apps to reach the Play Store.Google Cardboard. Image source: Google.Expanding that ecosystem can help Google widen its moat against Facebook, which already runs its own VR app store, Oculus Home, for its Oculus Rift headset. Google likely considers Oculus Home as a major threat in the fledgling VR market, so simplifying VR app development for Android might help the Play Store successfully evolve from a mobile storefront to a VR one. Google is also reportedly developing an upgraded plastic Cardboard headset for phones and a stand-alone VR headset which doesn't require a phone, PC, or console. Android N's new features reveal that Google is defending its turf against its most formidable foes. The OS is becoming more like Windows to counter the popularity of the Surface, it's supporting pressure-sensitive screens to keep up with Apple, and it's gaining more VR features to hold Facebook at bay. Those are all smart moves, but the future of Android N will ultimately depend on how well Google's OEM partners can implement all these features in their new devices.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

" (  ) - On Feb. 17, ADI stock closed 1.3% higher after the manufacturer of integrated circuits used in digital and analog signal systems beat analysts' estimates for its fiscal first quarter.Adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus estimate by 3 cents. Revenue of $769.4 million also beat estimates, but sales declined 0.3% year over year and 21.4% from the prior quarter. Management cited weakness in the consumer market, especially in the portable segment.Following the earnings announcement, S&P Capital IQ Equity Research maintained its ""Sell"" rating on ADI stock and its 12-month price target of $50, but reduced its earnings estimates. Its analysts lowered their fiscal 2016 operating EPS forecast by 3 cents to $2.81 and their fiscal 2017 estimate by 16 cents to $3.27.Capital IQ warns revenues will decline 3.3% in fiscal 2016, following a 20% increase in the previous year, and that orders are likely to ""remain lumpy given seasonal trends.""After making a high at $68.97 on June 1, ADI stock fell into a bear market. The bearish resistance line connects the June high to the highs in October and November, as well as Friday's high near $59.ADI stock broke above its 200-day moving average on Friday but is having difficulty holding above it. A close below this important line would trigger a new sell signal.Traders should sell ADI stock short at $58 with a downside target of $50 for a potential return of almost 14%. A stop-loss order should be entered at $60.Analog Devices pays a dividend of 42 cents per share for a current forward annual yield of 2.9%, and shares are expected to go ex-dividend in late May.

"pple's 3D Touch in action. Image credit: Apple.It is well-known that  was instrumental to enabling the 3D Touch functionality present in  's current iPhone 6s/6s Plus flagship devices. In particular, according to Chipworks, Analog Devices supplies the controller chip for 3D Touch.Ahead of its Feb. 17 earnings release, Analog Devices issued an updated outlook for its first fiscal quarter, warning investors that revenue would be lower than expected due to weaker-than-expected iPhone 6s/6s Plus sales.What was particularly interesting is that Analog Devices, in conjunction with the lowered revenue outlook, also reported that its gross profit margins would take a hit as a result of an ""inventory reserve associated with the updated revenue outlook.""I believe that this tells us something very interesting about Apple's next generation iPhones. In particular, I think there's a good chance that iPhone 7/7 Plus will feature a next generation 3D Touch functionality requiring a more advanced controller from Analog Devices. According to BusinessDictionary.com, an ""inventory reserve"" is a ""term that refers to a reserve used to account for inventory that is not sold at its cost.""Indeed, ahead of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus launch, Apple apparently ordered more components to support the build of more iPhone 6s/6s Plus phones than it was ultimately able to sell.This is why many Apple suppliers have been talking about an ""inventory correction"" that's impacting their businesses in the March quarter; if Apple needs to take down its iPhone inventories, it's going to be ordering a lot fewer components than originally expected.Analog Devices, in anticipation of a certain level of demand, appears to have ""overbuilt"" 3D Touch controllers for the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. This, according to Analog Devices CFO led them to reserve some of that inventory ""for a possible disposal.""Although it's a bummer for Analog Devices that it overbuilt 3D Touch controllers for the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, the good news -- at least for Apple and its customers -- is that this strongly suggests that the current generation 3D Touch controllers won't be used in the iPhone 7-series phones.After all, if Apple  planning to keep the same 3D Touch controllers, this ""inventory reserve for a possible disposal"" on Analog Devices' part wouldn't be necessary, would it? These parts could just be used in the iPhone 7-series phones.Since comments from Analog Devices' management indicates that it will be in the next iPhone, it stands to reason that the iPhone 7/7 Plus will use meaningfully enhanced 3D Touch controllers from the chipmaker. Updated 3D Touch controllers strongly suggest an improvement in functionality. By far the most obvious avenue of improvement -- and one that has been rumored in the press previously -- is the addition of multi-3D Touch functionality.Although multi-3D Touch probably isn't a feature that, alone, could carry the iPhone 7/7 Plus to record sales, the inclusion of this feature coupled with a bunch of other enhancements across the phone could make for one heck of an upgrade.Cable is dying.

"ccording to a report from Digitimes, chip suppliers to  have begun to ""book production capacity"" at both foundry and back-end (i.e., packaging and test) partners.In particular, the report cites  -- a key audio component vendor for Apple's products -- and  (provider of key 3D Touch components into the iPhone 6s/6s Plus) as having told their vendors to ""reserve a significant portion of their production capacities in the second and third quarters [of the year].""The report claims that both Cirrus and Analog Devices will ""play a key role in the brand-new design"" for Apple's next-generation iPhone 7 devices. The devices are said to be both ""slimmer than existing iPhone models"" and will not include a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack -- both in line with reports that have been circulating in the press for quite some time.Finally, the report claims that chipmaker  is expected to ""grab most of or probably all orders for Apple's A10 processors."" This is in line with a story that  broke late last year and that a number of independent sources (including KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo as well as yours truly) managed to confirm.Let's take a look at what the implications should be for each of these vendors. A key theme driving the bull case for Cirrus Logic recently has been the notion that it will gain further dollar content in the iDevice maker's next-generation smartphones. Though there is some debate as to how extensive these content gains will be, the consensus seems to be that it goes up from here.In a nutshell, this means that even if Apple fails to grow unit shipments during the iPhone 7 cycle (though I am hopeful that it will return to growth), Cirrus has a good shot of seeing Apple-related revenue growth thanks to the added content. Analog Devices was put in the spotlight ahead of the iPhone 6s cycle as it was reported to supply analog-to-digital converters in support of the new 3D Touch feature. As long as Analog Devices hangs on to the 3D Touch socket in the iPhone 7, then it should benefit from an increase in the number of iPhones sold with 3D Touch capability in the coming fiscal year.Beyond this, however, Digitimes  claims that Analog Devices will ""offer driver components for a dual-lens design for the [iPhone 7],"" suggesting additional content share capture. I now expect Analog Devices' iPhone-related revenues to jump nicely year over year during the iPhone 7 cycle. After triumphing over archrival  in grabbing all of Apple's A8 manufacturing orders, Taiwan-based TSMC was forced to yet again split chip orders with Samsung for the A9.However, with the A10 said to be going exclusively to TSMC, TSMC should enjoy a nice revenue boost in the second half of the year associated with that. Additionally, the A10 is said to employ TSMC's InFO Wafer Level packaging, which should mean additional dollar content per chip for TSMC.All told, it looks like the iPhone 7 cycle should be good to TSMC on a dollar content per-phone basis.Cable is dying.

 reported first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of 56 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents. Adjusted earnings per share excluded one-time items but included stock-based compensation expenses.Following the first-quarter results, shares were down 1.1% in after-hour trading session due to weaker economic conditions and significant weakness in the portable consumer electronics sector.Analog Devices generated revenues of $769.4 million, down 21.4% sequentially and 0.3% year over year. The decline was due to significant weakness in the consumer market, especially the consumer portable segment. However, other end markets - industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure - performed in line with the company's expectations.However, revenues were above the company's recent revised guidance range of $745-$765 million as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $761.0 million.Industrial market generated 45% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 5.1% sequentially and 1% year over year). This represents a diversified market for the company, including industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and health care segments.Communications generated 22% of total revenue, up 4.1% sequentially but down 15.9% year over year.Within Communications, wireline applications improved both sequentially as well as year over year. However, wireless infrastructure grew from the last quarter but was down from the prior year.The Automotive segment generated around 17% of Analog Devices' first-quarter revenues, down 4.3% sequentially but up 2.2% year over year.Revenues in all the sub-segments under this business were flat to down sequentially and in line with the seasonal patterns.The Consumer segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with its computing and handset businesses, plummeted 60.3% sequentially but grew 31.6% year over year. It accounted for 16% of total revenue.Though audio/video applications decreased in line with seasonal patterns, revenues from portable consumer applications declined significantly due to weaker-than-expected customer demand.MarginsPro-forma gross margin was 62.2%, down 350 basis points (bps) sequentially and 340 bps year over year. The decline was primarily due to higher inventory reserves and lower utilization rates.Analog Devices reported adjusted operating expenses of $264.8 million, down 9.3% sequentially and 1.4% year over year. Pro-forma operating margin of 27.8% was down 810 bps sequentially and 304 bps year over year.On a GAAP basis, Analog Devices recorded a net profit of $164.5 million or 52 cents per share compared with $96.3 million or 30 cents in the prior quarter.The company generated adjusted net profit of $176.3 million compared with $326.1 million in the fourth quarter. Pro-forma earnings per share came in at 56 cents compared with $1.03 in the previous quarter.Analog Devices exited the first quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $3.79 billion, up from $3.03 billion in the prior quarter.

Analog Devices spent $132.0 million on share repurchases and $124.7 million on cash dividends.During the first quarter, Analog Devices announced its decision to hike quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 42 cents per share, representing a 5% increase from the prior amount. The new dividend will be paid on Mar 8, 2016, to stockholders of record as of Feb 26.Additionally, the company increased its stock buyback authorization to $1 billion. As of Jan 30, 2016, the company had $415 million remaining under the previous authorization.For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, management expects sequential revenue growth in the range of -2% to +4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $800 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 65.5%, operating expenses to be slightly up sequentially, interest and other expense of about $15 million, tax rate of 13% and earnings per share in a range of 58-66 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 62 cents.On a GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margins of 65.3%, tax rate of roughly 14% and earnings per share in the range of 52-60 cents.Analog Devices delivered decent results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the top line and the bottom line. However, the consumer segment was weak.Though the company expects industrial, auto and communication markets in the mid-to-high single digits in fiscal second quarter, it expects the consumer market to remain weak.In 2015, the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded the available opportunities. It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting 2017.The company is investing heavily in the health sector and working with several of the world's leading research institutions and system OEMs to improve performance, impact and affordability of medical electronics devices. Primary focus areas within this segment include care-imaging applications and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring.While investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and countering increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will ensure investor loyalty.Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some well-ranked stocks in the same space are MaxLinear, Inc.  , Inphi Corporation  and Microchip Technology Inc.  .

 recently announced its decision to hike quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 42 cents per share, representing a 5% increase from the prior amount. The new dividend will be paid on Mar 8, 2016, to stockholders of record as of Feb 26.Additionally, the company increased its stock buyback authorization to $1 billion. As of Jan 30, 2016, the company had $415 million remaining under the previous authorization.The strength of Analog Devices' business model is reflected in its strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to return value to shareholders.Analog Devices' strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility to offer dividend hikes, repurchase shares and pursue strategic acquisitions. During the last quarter, Analog Devices spent $111.7 million on share repurchases and paid $125.6 million as dividends. The cash and short-term investments balance was $3.03 billion, down from $3.09 billion in the prior quarter. The debt to total capital ratio, including long-term liabilities and short-term debt, was 19.0%. We remain encouraged by Analog Devices' strong cash position and its ability to service long-term debts.Analog Devices is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Feb 17. Last month, the company lowered the first-quarter revenue expectation to a range of $745-$765 million, from the $805-$855 million range. Management blamed the weaker-than-expected demand in the portable consumer business unit for the guidance cut, which it expects to linger in the second quarter as well.Though we remain concerned about the competitive pressures across several markets, Analog Devices is solidly positioned in secular growth markets. Also, continued share buybacks and dividend hikes will inspire investors' loyalty.Analog Devices carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some well-ranked stocks in the same space are MaxLinear, Inc.  , Inphi Corporation  and Microchip Technology Inc.  .

"he steady stream of evidence that iPhone sales are indeed slowing continues.  has just revised its guidance lower for the fourth quarter, which doesn't bode well for  , either.Analog Devices provides the microcontroller that facilitates the new Force Touch feature in the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and the company has acknowledged that a lot of the prior guidance range was being driven by a ""  "" that is ""  ."" Now, Analog Devices expects sales to come in between $745 million to $765 million, down from the prior outlook of $805 million to $855 million. Analysts were modeling for the company to put up $830 million in revenue.In no uncertain terms, the chipmaker attributes the lower sales to weakness in its ""portable consumer business unit"" that began in December and is expected to continue into the current quarter. Analog Devices says demand for its other business segments are still on track. This is certainly a blow to Analog Devices, as its consumer segment has been an important growth driver. The consumer business comprised about a third of revenue last quarter at $317.4 million. That was up 53% sequentially and 234% year over year. Slower demand within this business hurts, but it isn't fatal by any means, since Analog Devices is diversified in many other sectors like industrial, automotive, and communications.Apple, on the other hand, is far more susceptible to changing sentiments around its iPhone business. The Mac maker's weakness over the past month can be entirely attributed to negative storylines regarding iPhone demand, with various rumors that Apple is reducing orders at its suppliers. Analog's release reinforces these storylines. It was obvious long ago that Force Touch would be the key selling feature of the iPhone 6s, even before Apple officially announced it. Apple Watch's 3D Touch was the clear precursor, and it seems that perhaps Force Touch isn't the effective upgrade driver that Apple had hoped.The timing couldn't be worse, either. The possibility of an unsuccessful iPhone launch has always been a huge risk factor for Apple, and a potentially underwhelming upgrade cycle is coming at a time when the iPhone's growth potential is being questioned. It's not that the iPhone 6s is necessarily ""unsuccessful,"" but it could be worse than expected.A lack of interest in Force Touch also has implications for the iPad. The feature is expected to make its way to Apple's tablet eventually, even if it takes time to technically achieve it on the much larger display. But if the demand isn't there, Apple may not be able to rely on Force Touch to drive iPad upgrades either.Apple has said that it expects the iPhone to grow in the fourth quarter, both in terms of revenue and units. That outcome is seemingly less likely by the day.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The company expects this weakness to persist in the second quarter as well.Nevertheless, Analog Devices expects demand trends across industrial, automotive, and communication infrastructure markets to match its expectations.Also, on a non-GAAP basis, the company revised the gross margin guidance to 62% from 64.5%; operating expenses to $264 million from $292 million; interest and other expense of approximately $10 million from $5 million and earnings per share in a range of 51-55 cents from 65-73 cents.On a GAAP basis, Analog Devices estimates operating expenses of $282 million; interest and other expense of roughly $13 million and earnings per share in a range of 47-51 cents as against 59-67 cents.Though we remain concerned about the competitive pressures across several markets, Analog Devices is solidly positioned in secular growth markets and its products continue to see strong deployment in the core markets, including the automotive space.Also, the analog and DSP integrated circuits supplier is investing heavily in the health sector and working with several of the world's leading research institutions and system OEMs to drive improvement in performance, impact and affordability of medical electronics devices.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is slated to report the first-quarter results on Feb 17.Some well-ranked stocks in the same space are MaxLinear, Inc.  , M/A-Com Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc.  and NXP Semiconductors NV  .

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.60), with the stock changing hands as low as $51.65 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices, Inc., looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, ADI makes up 4.94% of the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSI) which is trading lower by about 2.6% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices (ADI) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2016-01-06@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-adi-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2016-01-06
hareholders of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.8% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2018 covered call at the $70 strike and collect the premium based on the $4.00 bid, which annualizes to an additional 3.4% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 6.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $70 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but ADI shares would have to advance 21.5% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 28.4% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.8% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 covered call at the $70 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $70. (  ). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Analog Devices, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.71) to be 32%.

 reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings of $1.03 per share, which easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. Adjusted earnings per share excluded one-time items but included stock-based compensation expenses.The company's shares were up 6.37% on Tuesday, encouraged by good fourth-quarter financial results.Analog Devices generated revenues of $978.7 million, up 13.4% sequentially and 20.2% year over year. Also, revenues came above the higher end of the company's guidance range of $880-$940 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $909.0 million.The results were driven by strength in portable consumer devices and partially by improvement in the wireless communications infrastructure market.Industrial market generated 38% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 3.9% sequentially and 1.7% year over year). This represents a diversified market for the company, including industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and health care segments.Revenues in all sub-segments within the industrial business decreased sequentially with the exception of aerospace and defense, which was comparable with the prior quarter.Communications generated 16% of total revenue, up 12.3% sequentially but down 23.4% year over year.While Wireline applications decreased sequentially, the mixture of inventory replacement and improving wireless CapEx spend drove strong sequential revenue performance in wireless infrastructure. This was led by solid customer demand for the company's innovative microwave and RF solutions.The Automotive segment generated around 14% of Analog Devices' fourth-quarter revenues, up 1.6% sequentially but down 2.0% year over year.The Consumer segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with its computing and handset businesses, was up 12.3% sequentially but down 23.4% year over year. It accounted for 32% of total revenue.The pro forma gross margin was 65.7%, down 34 basis points (bps) sequentially and 65 bps year over year. The sequential decline was led by an unfavorable product mix.Analog Devices reported operating expenses of $291.8 million, up 6.1% sequentially and 8.8% year over year. The pro forma operating margin of 35.9% was up 171 bps sequentially and 248 bps year over year.On a GAAP basis, Analog Devices recorded a net profit of $96.305 million or 30 cents per share compared with $216.5 million or 68 cents in the prior quarter.The company generated adjusted net profit of $326.1 million compared with $245.7 million in the prior quarter. Pro-forma earnings came in at $1.03 per share compared with 77 cents in the previous quarter.Analog Devices exited the fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $3.03 billion, down from $3.09 billion in the prior quarter. Accounts receivables were $466.5 million, up from $451.5 million in the previous quarter.Long-term debt was approximately $498.5 million, more or less flat with the prior quarter.Net cash flow from operations was around $198.0 million. Analog Devices spent $111.7 million on share repurchases and $125.6 million on cash dividends.Additionally, the company's board of directors announced a cash dividend of 40 cents. The quarterly dividend will be paid on Dec 15, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 5.Management expects first-quarter fiscal 2016 revenues in the range of $805-$855 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $835 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company estimates gross margin of approximately 64.5%, operating expenses within $274-$279 million, interest and other expense of approximately $5 million, tax rate of 14% and earnings per share in a range of 65-73 cents. The guidance is stronger than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents for the quarter.On a GAAP basis, the company estimates operating expenses within the $292-$297 million range, a tax rate of approximately 15% and earnings per share in the range of 59-67 cents.Analog Devices delivered strong results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both top and bottom lines. The consumer segment was the key driver of results in the quarter. While order rates did slow down for the seasonally slower first quarter, first-quarter expectations came in better than expected.In 2015, the company successfully incorporated Hittite and expanded available opportunities. It expects to deliver strong revenue synergies starting in 2017.The company is investing heavily in the health sector and working with several of the world's leading research institutions and system OEMs to drive improvement in performance, impact and affordability of medical electronics devices. This, in turn, will help shift health care delivery to the point of care. Primary focus areas within this segment include care-imaging applications and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring.While investments are aimed at strengthening the product line and sustaining increasing competition, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will support investor sentiment.Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the other stocks worth considering are NVIDIA Corp.  , Texas Instruments Inc.  and MeetMe, Inc.  , each holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"announced on Tuesday that it's hiking airfares around the country by an average of $3 one-way. Two days later, shares of and both received upgrades.For semiconductor investors, 2015 has been a good year.Over the past 11.5 months (and counting -- semis are up another 1% in early Tuesday trading), shares of the  have gained a good 8% in price. That may not sound like much -- but it's three times the average gain on the S&P 500.And yet, these gains have not been shared equally. Micro-electro mechanical systems specialist  , for example, is up less than 4% year to date.  has notched a more respectable 7% gain, very close to the average in its industry. And yet, up until this morning, TI was actually neck and neck with Analog Devices, and lagging the industry. So what changed today?Texas Instruments got an upgrade. And Analog Devices got downgraded. It's a fact of pure coincidence, but both the shares of Texas Instruments (market cap of more than $58 billion) and those of Analog Devices (market cap of less than $18 billion) currently cost about $57 and change. But according to the analysts at  , that's where the similarities end.This morning, the banker announced it's upgrading shares of Texas Instruments to outperform, and assigning a new $70 price target that implies 21% profits potential for investors who buy the stock today. According to the analyst, ""TXN is levered to some of the fastest growing and sexier end markets within the sticky, high margin automotive segment,"" which provides about 15% of the company's revenue. This business has been showing ""double-digit growth in each of the last two years"" and, according to  , Oppenheimer believes that ""this growth is sustainable long term, as average semiconductor content outgrows vehicle units at least 2x over the next decadeplus.""Thus, a company that turned 85 years young in 2015, still looks to have a bright future, and one that will be characterized by ""gross margin expansion,"" ""higher fab utilization,"" and strong returns to shareholders from share buybacks and dividends.Not so Analog Devices. According to Oppenheimer, Analog Devices' ""core businesses"" exhibit both ""stickiness and stability"" (in a good way). But Analog Devices' consumer focus makes the company's revenues too ""volatile"" for Oppenheimer's tastes. Together, that adds up to a downgrade to neutral in Oppy's estimation. And the analyst has pulled its price target completely, to boot.In particular, Oppenheimer worries that Analog Devices depends too heavily on just one company (rhymes with ""Snapple"") for its revenue, and that weak sales of the new iPhone 6S, and uncertainty about future incorporation in upcoming iPad generations, both bode poorly for Analog Devices' business in the near term.Which raises the question(s): Is Oppenheimer right to be optimistic about Texas Instruments? Is it right to worry about Analog Devices? Well, we've got good news and bad news on that front. Turns out, Oppenheimer is very likely  about  Texas Instruments  Analog Devices.You see, at  , we've been tracking Oppenheimer's performance as an analyst for nearly a decade now. What we've learned over this time is that Oppenheimer is at best a middling sort of analyst. Ranked no higher than the second quintile of investors globally, Oppy gets the majority of its stock picks wrong -- and it's  .Although semiconductors is the fourth most-recommended sector that Oppenheimer covers, it's far from this banker's forte. If Oppy gets only 41% of its stock picks right in general, its record for accuracy in semis is an abysmal 36%. Among the analyst's more notable misses:
  
So as you can see, a black mark from Oppenheimer is hardly the kiss of death for Analog Devices. Nor is a gold star from Oppy a guarantee of success for Texas Instruments -- not in the past, and not today either. Rather than just take Oppenheimer's word on it, therefore, let's take a look at these stocks ourselves, and see what we come up with. Here's how the valuations of these four major semi players compare, one to another:
  
All data courtesy of  . As you can see from the above chart, Oppenheimer is broadly right in that it recognizes the overvaluation of Analog Devices, for example. At the same time, however, the fact that Analog Devices is  much more expensive than the other semi stocks discussed above, suggests Oppenheimer may have stopped too short in downgrading the stock only to neutral. With ADI costing more than twice  , a sell rating may actually be more appropriate here. (And as for Texas Instruments, yes, it is a bit cheaper than Analog Devices -- but still not cheap enough to make the stock an obvious buy.)Turns out, better values may be found among Oppenheimer's historical ""mistakes."" NVIDIA, for example, looks cheaper than either of the two stocks Oppenheimer examined this week. Tiny FormFactor -- cash-rich, debt-free, expected to grow briskly, and swimming in free cash flow -- may actually be the best pick of all.Long story short, I see little reason to follow Oppenheimer's stock advice on semiconductors this week. But its past picks may have more merit.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Nov 24. Last quarter, the company posted a 4.05% positive earnings surprise.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices' third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Revenues of $863.4 million were up year over year and beat our estimates on the back of growth across most of its product lines. However, margins were down sequentially as well as year over year due to unfavorable mix.The company derives a significant percentage of revenues from the Industrial and Communication markets, which are currently witnessing strong demand, and should boost fourth-quarter results. These markets are likely to grow in the near term backed by increased 4G deployments in the U.S.However, the company's high cost structure due to continuous investments and increasing competition in the analog market could affect results in the to-be-reported quarter.For the fourth quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $880-$940 million and non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 65.5%. Earnings per share are likely to range within 79-87 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Deviceswill beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 84 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Analog Devices'Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Casey's General Stores, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).BBVA Banco Francés S.A.  , with an Earnings ESP of +10.71% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Seadrill Partners LLC  , with an Earnings ESP of +12.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ilicon Labs has found an unofficial mascot in the Gecko series of microcontrollers. Source: Silicon Labs.Semiconductor designer  reported  on Wednesday morning. The quarter left management's own projections far behind, and Silicon Labs shares rose as much as 12.4% in Thursday's morning session.
  
Source: SEC filings.Sales came in at the very top end of management's official guidance for the third quarter. On the bottom line, Silicon Labs had set the top end of its guidance range at $0.10 per share.Management offered the following guidance targets for the fourth quarter, based on current business trends and macroeconomic environments.Silicon Labs CEO Tyson Tuttle basically urged the rampant macro headwinds to come and get him: ""Despite the challenging macro environment, we are confident in our strategy and proud of our accomplishments,"" Tuttle said. ""We are engaging with top industry leaders who are rapidly adopting our IoT solutions and propelling our design win activity to record levels. We are executing on our vision and strategy and excited about what lies ahead.""Silicon Labs investors have been riding a dramatic roller coaster over the last 52 weeks. The stock has barely outperformed the S&P 500 in that period, including Wednesday's sudden surge.Including these results, Silicon Labs shares now trade for 25 times trailing earnings. That's right in line with the competition, as  trades at 28 times trailing earnings and  looks back at a P/E ratio of 21. But neither one of these giants can match Silicon Labs' earnings growth figures, and TI's profits are actually shrinking.On a grander scale, Silicon Labs prides itself on providing ""energy-friendly solutions for a smarter, more connected world."" The IoT division fits right into that timely vision, and that segment's results speak for themselves.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""...

Merger rumors in NVIDIA's neck of the semiconductor woods, even tough this particular chatter never involved NVIDIA itself. On Oct. 14, the rumor mill echoed with reports that  might merge with fellow mixed-signal processor maker  . NVIDIA rose 4% that day and never looked back. Shareholders seem excited about the idea of sector giants on the prowl for a deal in the ""merger of equals"" category. Maxim and ADI never commented on those merger rumors, and the gossip has since moved on to pairing Maxim with even larger rival  . That development hasn't negated NVIDIA's potential-merger boost at all, especially since the graphics processor specialist followed up with a strong third-quarter report near the start of November.If all of that sounds like roses and unicorns, you must have forgotten about August already. Because of a with weak consumer-goods sales, DreamWorks shares fell more than 17% in that quarter.The chip market is awash in major mergers, and the time has never been more ripe for NVIDIA to define an exit strategy. In particular, I wouldn't be surprised to see Texas Instruments turning its sights away from Maxim due to broadly overlapping product portfolios, and take a closer look at NVIDIA. The overlaps would be far smaller here, making TI an instant contender in several parts of the mobile and automotive markets where NVIDIA has been eating TI's lunch in recent years.Mind you, it's all just rumors at this point. Maxim hasn't found a final buyer yet, and nobody has even hinted at talking to NVIDIA's board of directors.So NVIDIA's shareholders continue an inspiring ride that has seen share prices skyrocket 50% higher over the last six months. Maxim has only gained 24%, direct buyout rumors notwithstanding. Is NVIDIA going to Texas or Massachusetts in the near future, or perhaps nowhere at all? Grab a bag of popcorn and a comfy deck chair.

"lthough we maintain that the long term matters far more than short-term performance in saving for a successful retirement, a successful or disappointing earnings report can loom large over the stocks we watch here at the Fool. Winners can be handsomely rewarded, and even disappointing earnings reports can create attractive entry points for patient investors.As earnings season picks up steam, we recently surveyed a number of our Foolish contributors to identify a tech stocks they believe could beat expectations in the weeks to come. Small-scale chipmaker  could see a surge in revenue if rumors that it won placement in the iPhone 6s prove accurate. Industrial materials power  could once again demonstrate why it's one of the best-run companies in its space. And red hot e-commerce juggernaut  shows no signs of slowing down from its torrent of innovation and top-line growth.These brief excerpts represent a mere snapshot of what makes these names worth investors' attention. Read on to find out why these three tech stocks could surprise investors in their upcoming reports.(  ): Along with much of the tech community, I remain  by niche semiconductor firm Analog Devices for one primary reason -- the iPhone 6s.Analog Devices manufactures the chips that power the much-touted Force Touch sensors in the  Watch, a placement that numerous credible teardown reports have confirmed. And with the inclusion of Force Touch as the ""flagship"" feature of the iPhone 6s, many believe Analog Devices could see a substantial spike in revenue as iPhone-related revenue begins to appear in its upcoming report. However, this is no sure thing. Although many prominent iPhone 6s teardowns have yet to be published, a few preliminary reports  explicitly list Analog Devices among the component suppliers for Cupertino's latest smartphone. Identifying component manufacturers can prove quite vexing, so this doesn't definitively mean Analog Devices was left out in the cold for the iPhone 6s.This does represent an important key to successfully examining a possible Apple component supplier like Analog Devices -- supplying components to the iDevice company can be risky business. With the potential to almost instantly add millions, if not billions, of revenue to a supplier's top line, Apple understands and uses its financial weight to its advantage. This situation has created multiple boom-and-bust scenarios for companies such as  ,  , and others. Analog Devices reports quite late in earnings season, so be sure to watch for potential fireworks in its report on Nov. 24. Of all the tech companies with a habit of underpromising and overdelivering, I think Corning has the greatest chance to maintain its impressive streak. Last quarter marked Corning's  quarterly earnings beat -- a performance driven by a combination of aggressive share repurchases and strong operational execution, the latter of which included healthy growth from its Optical Communications business, and cost reduction efforts at its core Display Technologies segment.That said, Corning's revenue last quarter also came in light at $2.52 billion -- slightly below expectations for $2.54 billion -- hurt primarily by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. But those headwinds should prove temporary, and Corning's top- and bottom-line growth should see a nice boost once they subside. In the meantime, Corning is hard at work positioning itself for future growth with innovative projects. Take ""Project Phire,"" for example, a sapphire-esque offshoot of Corning's popular Gorilla Glass product that hasn't formally launched yet, but had  on an unnamed wearable device as of last quarter's report.Keeping in mind that shares currently trade around 11.7 times next year's expected earnings, just before that report Corning's board also approved a new $2 billion share repurchase program. So all things considered, when Corning releases third-quarter results later this month, I would be thoroughly surprised if the shares of the glass products specialist don't jump after exceeding analysts' earnings expectations yet again. While it may be a seemingly unconventional pick for this roundtable, because it's widely considered a retailer, Amazon is quietly becoming a tech powerhouse. If you own the company, you should be as excited about its Amazon Web Services, or AWS, host of Web and cloud-based solutions as about its high-profile online marketplace.Recently, the company disclosed that AWS is now a business with a $7.3 billion annual run rate. Of course, that's not a large part of Amazon's revenue haul of the past four quarters ($96 billion, inclusive of AWS ), but that's not what makes Amazon Web Services so important to investors. When it comes to profit profile, the business punches above its weight. data by For example, during the first half of 2015, Amazon reported that its AWS division produced segment operating income of $655 million on revenue of $3.39 billion, producing an operating income margin of 19%. As a comparison, both of Amazon's retailing divisions (North America and international) reported segment operating income of $1.13 billion on $42.5 billion of net revenue.At these profit profiles, Amazon would have doubled its retail operating income if it reported $5.8 billion in AWS (or a run rate of $11.6 billion, as this is a half-year's returns). And although this projected figure is 71% higher than Amazon's first-half AWS revenue, the company grew AWS revenue 81% on a year-on-year basis. AWS doesn't appear to be fully valued into the stock, and the company could outperform estimates as a result thereof.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

In addition, he reiterated the price target of $66.00.Danely remains optimistic about the company's solid business model, increasing margins and profits, high dividend yield and upside from the Apple Inc.  design win.He believes that the touch technology used in Apple's devices will boost Analog Devices' earnings. According to him, this new design win could be accretive to revenues by 13% and add 36 cents to earnings in 2016. However, this design win could impact margins, thus lowering the company's overall margins to 33.2%.The analyst also believes that the Apple design win should expand Analog Devices' earnings growth at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20%. Additionally, Danely expects the company's earnings to reach $4.50 per share in 2016, up 50% from the 2015 earnings estimate of $3.00.Moreover, the analyst remains encouraged by Analog Devices' dividend yield of 3%, which is 25% higher than the semiconductor group and 30% more than the S&P 500.Danely stated that though the demand from the company's industrial and automotive markets appears weak, Analog Devices' new products will continue to witness strong deployment in the communications market, further expanding its share in the sensor market. The analyst believes that the possibility that the company might supply Apple with components for next-generation iPhones and iPads will boost sales in the communications market.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. Its large customer base provides a distinct competitive edge. We believe that the company's supremacy is driven by its innovative design technology and vast product portfolio.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"nvestors in Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) saw new options become available this week, for the November 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ADI options chain for the new November 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ADI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.72/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.45% return on the cash commitment, or 28.01% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.85. If an investor was to purchase shares of ADI stock at the current price level of $55.72/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $57.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.51% if the stock gets called away at the November 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ADI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ADI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $57.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.32% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.88% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 32%.

"3D Touch is the headline selling feature in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Image source: Apple.As expected, the headline selling feature in  's new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models will be 3D Touch, the rebranded technology that integrates pressure sensitivity into the display to unlock a whole new slew of interface interactions. Seeing as how investing in Apple component suppliers is a popular investing trend these days, investors can't help wondering if  is worth looking at, since the smaller analog-chip maker is reportedly the exclusive supplier of the microcontroller that drives the 3D Touch display. The Street has been busy tackling this very question. Last month before earnings, BlueFin Research Partners estimated that overall Force/3D Touch revenues could add up to an additional $500 million in fiscal 2016. The firm notes that Analog Devices has had some trouble finding customers willing to pay for its superior performance, but Apple fits the bill quite nicely.Seeing as how the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus production ramp likely started a few months ago, it was no surprise when Analog then reported record revenues of $863 million in its fiscal third quarter. It was also pretty obvious where the strength was coming from as well.
  
Source: SEC filings.In no uncertain terms, the consumer segment stole the show. Naturally, Analog Devices has to speak vaguely when referring to Apple on the conference all, but it's pretty clear who it is. Here's CFO David Zinsner:Not only were the quarter's results better than expected, but Analog Devices also issued upbeat guidance. In the coming quarter, revenue is expected in the range of $880 million to $940 million, which utterly crushed the consensus forecast of $876 million. Following the strong results, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey boosted its rating on Analog Devices to ""buy"" while increasing its price target from $68 to $71. The firm believes that Apple Force/3D Touch will proliferate throughout Apple's lineup in the coming quarters, and Analog Devices will be a key beneficiary as the incremental revenue adds up.This is an entirely reasonable conjecture, since Apple tends to introduce innovative new technologies in one major product before bringing it to the rest of the product portfolio. Usually, Apple does this with the iPhone first, but this time around it introduced Force Touch first in Apple Watch and the new MacBooks before the iPhone (Analog Devices supplies the chips in both of these devices). That being said, I fully expect the iPad to get 3D Touch next, although it'll take more time to implement the technology on such large displays.RBC Capital also rates Analog Devices ""outperform"" with a $70 price target.It seems that the Street is mostly bullish on Analog Devices as Apple ramps up Force/3D Touch. Even though Apple is contributing heavily to the near-term upside, it's also good that Analog Devices has a very large and diversified customer base.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.60), with the stock changing hands as low as $53.03 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices, Inc., looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

Citing ""people with knowledge of the matter,"" Bloomberg says Analog Devices and Maxim are ""in talks about a possible combination that would give them more scale in a consolidating industry.""More specifically, sources told Bloomberg Maxim was working with an unnamed bank on a strategic review -- an unsurprising development considering Maxim's ambitious efforts to reduce costs, transform its manufacturing footprint, and optimize R&D and sales to  -- when it was approached by Analog Devices about the potential merger.Analog Devices, for its part, is no stranger to such deals. Last year it completed a roughly $2 billion deal to acquire Hittite Microwave Corporation, to leverage its RF, microwave, and millimeter wave technologies and bring more complete solutions to its industrial and automotive customers. By contrast, the majority of Maxim's revenue comes from chips used in consumer electronic devices. While I'm sure together Analog Devices and Maxim could identify compelling synergies and offer customers more comprehensive product solutions, there's no guarantee a merger of this size will come to fruition. Combing that with the uncertainty that Analog Devices' chips are in a  , as well as the fact Maxim has found top-line growth elusive of late, I think investors in both companies would be wise to consider taking at least some of today's quick gains off the table.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at ADI given that, according to its RSI reading of 28.92, it is now in oversold territory.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet, ADI's low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Analog Devices' earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 12 earnings estimate revisions move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for ADI has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $2.90/share two months ago to just $2.97/share right now.If this wasn't enough, Analog Devices also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)  which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.9, after changing hands as low as $53.80 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 38.0. A bullish investor could look at ADI's 29.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

This is a diversified market for the company, which includes the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and health care segments.Strong performance of industrial verticals, such as aerospace and defense and the renewable energy sector, was offset by weaker industrial automation sales.Communications generated 16% of total revenue, down 21.6% sequentially and 14.2% year over year. This was the third consecutive quarter in which revenues of this segment declined. Revenues from wireline customers constituted one-third of its communications infrastructure sales, and was roughly flat with the prior quarter.A weaker-than-expected wireless infrastructure market in North America and China coupled with customer inventory draw-downs impacted performance during the quarter. But the company believes that even though the current wireless infrastructure revenue run rates for ADI are artificially low, the strong position of the company in the sector will enable a rapid recovery.The Automotive segment generated around 15% of Analog Devices' third-quarter revenues, down 6.9% sequentially and 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.The Consumer segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with the computing and handset businesses, was up 89.6% sequentially and 155.4% year over year.

The consumer segment was the key driver of results in the quarter.A significant percentage of Analog Devices' revenues is realized from the Industrial and Communication markets. While the industrial market remained strong, the communication market was weak this quarter. A weaker-than-expected wireless infrastructure market, predominantly in North America and China resulted in sequentially lower revenues.Also 4G penetration rates remain low. Data consumption is increasing exponentially, and so is radio density. But management believes that the company's software defined radio and transceiver technologies will help solve challenges like efficient and flexible use of available spectrum, reducing power and systems cost at the same time. Furthermore, it will be able to deliver lower total cost of ownership to customers and in the process drive growth for Analog Devices.In wireline infrastructure, transition from 10G and 40G to 100G systems to satisfy growing data demand creates strong growth opportunities for the company. Overall, mixed-signal, RF, and microwave technologies are in demand. The company is aggressively investing in these, which will help it to capitalize on the growing opportunity.The company is investing heavily in the health sector and is working with several of the world's leading research institutions and systems OEMs to drive advancements in the performance, impact, and affordability of medical electronics devices, helping shift health care delivery to point of care. The company is primarily focusing on care imaging applications and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring.While investments to strengthen the product line and deal with increasing competition will continue, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will support investor sentiment.Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the technology sector include Manhattan Associates, Inc.  , MicroStrategy Inc.  and Open Text Corporation  .

Source: Analog DevicesIn its recent earnings report, Analog Device's guidance came in well above what analysts expected, helping further solidify analysts' confidence that the company's status as Apple component supplier du jour will help lift its business. In fact, one sell-side analyst believes Force Touch component shipments will add as much as half a billion dollars in fresh sales to Analog Devices' coming fiscal year.This prediction assumes Force Touch only appears in the iPhone 6s and the iPad Pro, so the actual financial impact could swing in either direction depending on the actual number of Apple products that receive Force Touch functionality this year. And as exciting as that sounds for a company with a sales base of $3.2 billion over the last 12 months, the history of Apple's component suppliers is littered with cautionary tales, as well.With its vast financial resources and truly massive shipment volumes, winning Apple's business presents a mouth-watering growth opportunity for executives at component specialists like Analog Devices. However Apple has a well-documented history of leveraging its huge footprint to secure the best pricing possible and, when possible, to thwart its competitors from pushing copycat features into their devices, as well.While such arrangements typically benefit Apple in a number of ways, Apple's stringent supplier deals also tend to create  that can border on one-sided and damage a company's long-term business model.Placement wins in Apple devices drove significant top-line growth for companies like  and  . Apple accounts for the majority of Cirrus Logic's business, so any perceived change in its arrangements with Cupertino can incite panic among its investors. For example, Cirrus Logic shares promptly cratered -14% in a single day in 2013 on news that Apple had cut the audio amplifier's chips out of its iPad 4. Worse yet, OmniVision Technology shares plummeted more than 50% in 2011, the year when Apple began dual-sourcing the image sourcing chips between OmniVision and  . Worst of all, the onerous terms Apple placed on its would-be sapphire supplier, the now defunct  at least contributed to its decision to file for bankruptcy late last year.Like I said at the open, landing a component supplier position in any Apple product can drive tremendous growth, but history is replete with examples of the fickle treatment Apple can offer those same companies. So as exciting as this new development might prove for Analog Device's shareholders, investors in the touchscreen controller supplier must also understand that doing business with Apple can bring with it its own unique set of risks.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Aug 18. Last quarter, the company posted a 1.39% positive earnings surprise.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices' second-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues of $821.0 million were up year over year and beat the estimates on the back of growth across most of its product lines. Also, margins improved sequentially as well as year over year, driven by favorable product mix.The company derives a significant percentage of revenues from the Industrial and Communication markets, which are currently witnessing strong demand, and should boost third-quarter results. The increased 4G deployments in China and the U.S. will continue to boost growth in these markets in the near term.However, the company's high cost structure due to continuous investments and increasing competition in the analog market could affect results in the to-be-reported quarter.For the third quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $825-$865 million and non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 66.0%. Earnings per share are likely to range within 71-77 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Deviceswill beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 74 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Analog Devices'Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Seadrill Partners LLC  , with an Earnings ESP of +12.28% and a Zacks Rank #1.Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.Foot Locker, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@QLD, ALXN, AAL, ADI: ETF Outflow Alert@2015-05-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qld-alxn-aal-adi-etf-outflow-alert-2015-05-29

hares of  hit a new 52-week high of $67.47 on May 22, eventually closing at $67.10. The company returned 33.3% in the past one year period and has gained approximately 21.7% year-to-date. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was roughly 2,303K.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. Its large customer base provides a competitive edge. We believe that the company is being driven by innovations in design technology and enjoys the advantages of a broad product portfolio.The company gained momentum on strong fundamentals and better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2015 results reported on May 19. Since then, the stock has moved up 10%.Analog Devices' top line increased 6.4% sequentially and 18.2% year over year to $821.0 million. Also, revenues were toward the higher end of the guided range of $810-$830 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $818.0 million. Non-GAAP earnings of 73 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Strong operating performance primarily led to the year-over-year earnings growth.For third-quarter 2015, Analog Devices projects revenues in the range of $825-$865 million. Earnings per share are expected within 71 cents to 77 cents. The relatively better bottom-line projection is an indication of continued momentum at the company.Analog Devices' strong execution,  expansion, investments in new product development and strategic acquisitions will continue to drive growth.

The company's new products will continue to see strong deployment in the emerging automotive market, further expanding its share in the sensor market.Additionally, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 1.13% over the trailing four quarters.

"ccording to  ,  analyst Chris Danely said chipmaker  has ""likely won a slot in  's next iPhone."" This win could positively impact Analog Devices' revenue and profit in 2016, according to the report.Let's take a closer look at what Danely had to say. Danely said this win could be worth $160 million in revenue to Analog Devices in 2016, adding about 4% to the company's expected top line for the year. The analyst estimated the deal's operating margin at 23.5%, lower than the 32.4% company-wide operating profit margin he expects for the full year.To explain his relatively low margin expectation for the deal, Danely said margins from ""high volume consumer products and large customers such as Apple"" are generally lower than ""high-performance analog products for industrial applications.""At any rate, the deal is still expected to be accretive to both revenue and earnings. Concordant with that view, Danely raised his 2016 earnings-per-share estimate for Analog by about 2.7%, from $2.98 to $3.06. Danely noted that although the iPhone win should ""boost revenue and [earnings per share] in a meaningful and material way"" for Analog, that Citi has ""a lot of concern on the long-term quality"" of this new revenue.""Apple is notorious for giving and taking away large design wins,"" Danely wrote in his research note. He added that Analog Devices has previously had ""large design wins"" with Apple that ""ended abruptly."" Those design-outs eventually led to ""downside to Consensus estimates and the stock selling off,"" he noted. Analog Devices is up ""just"" 1.44% following the publication of this research note as of this writing. The  index is up 1.35% and the  is up 1.5%, meaning Analog Devices shares aren't outperforming the relevant indices due to this news.This is likely because the Apple win for future iPhones -- and possibly also iPads -- was already reported by analysts at  (via MarketWatch) back in March. Analog Devices shares rallied by about 10% following that initial report.Additionally, at that time the Barclays analyst claimed that the wins at Apple for ""high accuracy"" analog-to-digital converters inside next-generation iPhones and iPads to enable Force Touch would add ""at least"" $0.80 to the company's 2016 earnings per share.It's not surprising, then, that a separate confirmation of news that is already ""known"" wouldn't move the stock much, if at all. It seems as though Analog Devices has won a spot inside the next-generation iPhone. I'd argue that winning this spot is good, although the company will have to continue to deliver best-in-class products at a price Apple is willing to pay in order to avoid losing the spot in future iPhone and iPads.That being said, almost every chip supplier is ""vulnerable"" to second sourcing and/or potential design win losses. Although Danely might be right to be cautious in light of Apple's history of swapping out suppliers, I'd say this situation is almost par for the course for component vendors.The key lesson for investors is to try to pick component vendors that offer technologies with high switching costs and a track record of delivering competitive products.

The Consumer segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with the computing and handset businesses, was up 14.6% sequentially and 40.4% year over year. It accounted for 12% of total revenue.Industrial, Automotive and Consumer segments exceeded revenue expectations for the quarter and offset a weak wireless infrastructure capex environment.Reported gross margin was 66.5%, up 92 basis points (bps) sequentially and 49 bps year over year backed by a favorable product mix.Analog Devices reported operating expenses of $269.6 million, up 13.1% from $238.3 million incurred in the year-ago quarter.

Hittite's offerings will strengthen Analog Devices' presence in the Industrial and Communication end markets.While investments to strengthen the product line and deal with increasing competition will continue, the policy of returning cash through dividends and share buybacks will support investor sentiment.Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the technology sector include Orbitz Worldwide, Inc.  , PetMed Express, Inc.  and Ellie Mae, Inc.  .

ource: Apple 's position as tech kingmaker is beyond dispute. Thanks to the immense popularity of its cadre of iDevices, as well as its generally forward-thinking approach to products, Apple's product decisions influence other firms ranging from industry powers like  to tiny start-ups around the world.Nowhere is Apple's corporate clout more evident than Apple's relationship with its suppliers, who can see their businesses transformed overnight by Apple's favor or scorn. And with the recent release of the Apple Watch, investors have been eagerly waiting to see which companies might benefit from Apple's latest major product. Let's take a look. In the past several weeks, a number of teardown services have dissected the Apple Watch in hopes of identifying the winners supplying parts.Other winners inside the Apple Watch include names like  and  . However, as the dust settles on the Apple Watch analysis, there's one company that clearly won the day with this next-gen smartwatch: Apple itself.With many analysts expecting Apple Watch shipments to extend beyond 10 million this year, the suppliers above each stand to benefit to varying degrees. However, unsurprisingly, these same teardown reports also show Apple itself will be, by far, the biggest beneficiary of the Watch's rollout.Recently, research firm IHS estimated the 38mm Apple Watch Sport costs a total of only $83.70 to manufacture and assemble. Contrast that minuscule number to the Apple Watch Sport's introductory price of $349, and it doesn't take much to get a sense that Apple will mint money, once again, with the Watch.It's tempting to simply say that, because of this, the Apple Watch enjoys gross margins of 76%. However, other key costs, like warranty and shipping, also factor into gross margin calculations, so the Apple Watch's gross margins will almost assuredly end up lower than that 76%.But for context, this compares quite favorably to other entry-level Apple products. The 16GB iPhone 6 and 16GB Wi-Fi-only iPad Air 2 have estimated gross margins of around 70% and 45%, respectively. While investors shouldn't let these seemingly lofty margin estimates get to their heads, it appears Apple has created another profit center with its Watch. Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Feb 19. Last quarter, the company posted a 1.64% positive earnings surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog's first-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues of $772.0 million were up year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by growth across most of its product lines. Also, order rates improved, particularly in the industrial and automotive end markets.The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from Industrial and Communication markets, which are witnessing strong demand and should drive the second-quarter results. The increased 4G deployments in China and the U.S. will continue to boost growth in these markets, in the near term. However, the company's high cost structure due to continuous investments and increasing competition in the analog market could be a matter of concern for the to-be-reported quarter.For the second quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $810-$830 million and non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 66.5%. Earnings per share are expected in the 70-74 cents range.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Deviceswill beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Most Accurate estimate stands at 68 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 72 cents. Hence, the difference is -5.56%. Analog Devices' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3:Teekay Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +35.71% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #1.Teekay Tankers Ltd.  , with an Earnings ESP of +31.58% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"hanks to a teardown  from ABI Research, we now know many of the ""winners"" inside of the  Watch. The Apple Watch is very likely the first wearable device that will sell in quantities meaningful enough such that a teardown report is useful to investors.Apple Watch Sport. Source: AppleWithout further ado, let's take a look at five companies that managed to score spots inside of the Apple Watch. Inside of the Apple Watch is a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/NFC/FM Radio combo chip from wireless-chip giant Broadcom.  The chip, according to the ABI Research teardown, is the BCM4332. Broadcom says that this integrates the Wi-Fi baseband, MAC, and the radio onto a single silicon die.Broadcom says that it can achieve ""over 200 Megabits per second of actual wireless throughput."" For some context, iFixit (citing Chipworks) reports that the iPhone 5s features the Broadcom BCM4334 chip, which Broadcom says delivers ""up to 150 [Megabits per second]"" of throughput.The Wi-Fi inside of the Apple Watch seems to be faster than the Wi-Fi found inside of the iPhone 5s! Another winner inside of the Apple Watch is Analog Devices. The analog-chip company is said to supply the touch controller into the Apple Watch. This is interesting, particularly as Apple has been using Broadcom touch controllers inside of its iPhones and iPads for a while now.Interestingly enough, a report from Barclays published last month (via  's) suggested that Analog Devices would be providing the analog-to-digital converter required for Apple's Force Touch in the next iPhone. With the iPhone 5s, ST Microelectronics  lost the accelerometer spot to Bosch, but retained the gyroscope spot. In the iPhone 6, ST Micro lost the gyroscope spot to  .The good news for ST Micro is that it won the combined accelerometer and gyroscope spot inside of the Apple Watch. Although I don't expect the revenue that ST Micro will get from this win is enough to make up for its losses inside of the iPhone, the win shows that ST Micro's technology is solid, and that it's still ""in the game."" Integrated Device Technology reportedly supplies a wireless charging chip into the Apple Watch. The competition here is fierce as it faces major companies such as Broadcom and  for wireless charging spots.Although the Apple Watch win itself is nice, I think it may pave the way to wins inside of future iPhone/iPad products. I'm almost certain that wireless charging is something that Apple plans to build into future iPhones/iPads, so IDT may have an edge -- if it executes well as an Apple Watch supplier -- when it comes time for Apple to pick the wireless charging chip supplier for those future iPhones and iPads. Finally, NXP Semiconductor seems to have won the NFC controller spot inside of the Apple Watch. NXP had already won the NFC controller and secure element spots inside of the iPhone 6/6 Plus, so this doesn't come as too much of a surprise.A solid, but not unexpected, win for NXP.

very time a new  product arrives, tech investors are eager to discover which supply chain companies manufactured the components inside. The Apple Watch was recently torn down by several firms, and some revelations were more surprising than others.The Apple Watch. Source: Apple. A teardown at Chipworks confirmed reports that  , a leading manufacturer of micro-electrical-mechanical systems (MEMS), didn't provide the six-axis gyroscope and accelerometer for the Apple Watch. Instead, that coveted spot went to its larger rival  .This is a disappointing setback for InvenSense for two reasons. First, it failed to build on its relationship with Apple after manufacturing gyroscopes for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Second, InvenSense CEO Behrooz Abdi declared that his company had a  in smartphone sensors earlier this year. However, that share will inevitably plummet as Apple Watch enters the market. IDC expects Apple to ship 15.9 million Apple Watches in 2015, which will account for 62% of the entire market.But if the Apple Watch sparks mainstream interest in smartwatches, sales of Android Wear watches will likely rise. That will boost InvenSense's top line, since it still dominates the non-Apple Watch market for smartwatch sensors. However, other smartwatch OEMs might be lured away by STMicroelectronics, especially if its MEMS cost less. That would certainly be disappointing, but losing the smartwatch market won't cripple InvenSense, since the company already generates plenty of revenue from selling smartphone motion sensors. The Chipworks teardown also found  and  components inside.Analog Devices, which designs and manufactures a wide variety of integrated circuits, MEMS, and power management products, supplied the capacitive touch screen controller for the Apple Watch. Texas Instruments provided the op-amp (operational amplifier) for the Apple Watch. Op-amps are cheap components which cost just a few cents on moderate production volume. Therefore, sales of op-amps probably won't generate much revenue for TI even if Apple sells millions of smartwatches.But if we look closely at Apple's aforementioned supply choices, we'll notice a trend: Apple prefers to deal with underdog suppliers instead of market leaders. Apple likely does this to command lower prices, since underdogs are more willing to sell cheaper components to gain a presence in the smartwatch market. An Apple Watch teardown at iFixit revealed two other notable features: a tiny battery and a deactivated blood oxygen monitor.The Apple Watch's battery has a capacity of just 205 mAh, which is much smaller than the 300 mAh batteries found in the  Gear Live and Moto 360. Apple claims that the battery should last up to 18 hours, which is comparable to most high-end Android Wear devices. Smaller batteries also charge quickly. Apple claims that the smartwatch requires just 1.5 hours to charge to 80%.The deactivated blood oxygen monitor was a surprising discovery, since there aren't any apps that utilize it yet. The sensors deliver light pulses through the skin and measure the number of oxygen molecules which reflect the light back. This suggests that upcoming apps, synchronized to HealthKit, could offer deeper health tracking features beyond tracking steps and heart rates. Last year, Samsung  , a health-tracking wearable which uses modular light pulse sensors for similar purposes. The teardowns of the Apple Watch reveal three main things: it relies on market underdogs for components, its battery is smaller but fairly power efficient, and more sophisticated health tracking apps could arrive in the near future.Investors should be careful when investing in supply chain players because they often win contracts by selling their components at rock bottom prices. Meanwhile, Apple likes to alternate between suppliers to reduce its dependence on single companies, which leads to unpredictable growth over long periods. In my opinion, teardowns like these usually reveal that the safest way to invest in Apple products is to simply buy  .

icrosemi Corporation's  second-quarter fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Microsemi reported revenues of $296.2 million, down 2% but up 3.2% year over year. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $297 million.In the reported quarter, book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1:1.Microsemi generates revenues from the Defense & security, Aerospace, Communications and Industrial markets.Around 33% of Microsemi's quarterly revenues came from the Communications market which decreased 12% sequentially and 3% year over year to $97.0 million. Management attributed the sequential weakness to slower-than-expected carrier capex spending.The Defense & security market generated 29% of sales, up 3% sequentially and 9% year over year. The increase was aided by improved defense end-market environment.Management expects this end market to continue to witness growth backed by improving defense budget and increasing foreign military sales.The Aerospace segment generated 16% of second-quarter revenues. The segment increased 19% sequentially and 12% year over year to $48 million. Commercial air as well as satellite and space-driven applications contributed to the increase.Management expects the satellite business to improve modestly in the upcoming quarter.The Industrial market generated 22% of sales, down 5% sequentially but flat year over year at $66 million. The decrease was due to lower sales in the energy exploration end markets and medical business.FPGAs generated 25% of second-quarter sales, up 5% sequentially and 14% year over year backed by Aerospace applications.The company's SoC FPGAs are used in multiple end markets namely, Aerospace, Defense, medical and industrial. Management stated that it will continue to improve its capabilities in the FPGA business, thereby expanding the revenue base.Mixed-signal RF accounted for 28% of the revenues, down 7% sequentially but up 10% year over year. The year-over-year increase was driven by strong demand for voice circuits, ultra-low power radios and broadband gateway applications.Timing products revenues accounted for 17% of sales, down 9% sequentially and 15% year over year due to weakness in industrial applications attached to oil and gas exploration.Management believes that with the increasing demand for bandwidth, the need for precise timing solutions will increase, boosting revenues.Legacy and others were flat sequentially, accounting for 30% of the total second-quarter sales.The reported gross margin was 57.2%, up 180 basis points (bps) sequentially and 540 bps year over year. The increase was due to a favorable product mix.Operating expenses of $105.3 million were higher than the previous quarter level of $111.8 million. As a percentage of sales, both general & administrative as well as research & development (R&D) expenses decreased from the year-ago quarter. The net result was an operating margin of 12%, up 950 bps year over year.Microsemi generated GAAP net income of $24.9 million or earnings of 26 cents per share compared with a net loss of $6.8 million or loss of 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.Excluding special items but including stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP net income was $52.5 million or earnings of 55 cents compared with $35.9 million or earnings of 38 cents a year ago.Cash and cash equivalents balance at quarter-end was $236.3 million, up from $183.0 million in the first quarter.

Days of inventory increased 7 days to 146 days. Accounts receivable were $181.4 million versus $191.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were down 1 day to 56 days.Microsemi provided guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenues are expected to be $302 million (+/- 2%) sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins are expected in the range of 56.4-57.1%. Earnings per share are expected within 67-71 cents, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents.For the third quarter, management expects capital spending to be approximately $12 million.Microsemi reported a decent quarter with the top line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company's focus on security and increasing electronic content per device and customers will eventually boost its market share. The company continues to consolidate select facilities to improve its long-term cost targets.However, management will continue to invest in FPGAs and mixed signal RF product offerings, which might increase the expenses, in turn impacting operating margins in the near term.Microsemi has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

hares of  lost around 1.2% and closed at $35.27, a day after the company reported disappointing first-quarter 2015 results on May 4. Adjusted earnings per share slumped 35.5% to 20 cents in the quarter from 31 cents in the prior-year quarter, mainly due to unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Earnings also trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents.Including one-time items, such as amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, the company reported earnings of 13 cents per share, contrary to a loss of 1 cent in the year-ago quarter.Total revenue declined 5.6% to $448 million from $474.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $429 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted revenues for the quarter.Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenues increased 4% year over year. Improvement was driven by growth in the Electricity segment, which offset a decrease in the Gas segment. The Water segment was consistent with the prior-year period.Cost of goods sold went down to $310 million from $320 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross profit also decreased 10.6% year over year to $138 million. Gross margin decreased 170 basis points (bps) to 30.8%, primarily due to unfavorable product mix and increased warranty expense in the Gas and Water segments, partially offset by improved performance in Electricity.Adjusted operating expenses declined to $119.8 million from $131.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating profit decreased 21.7% year over year to $18 million. Including one-time items, Itron's operating income increased to $13.5 million in the quarter from $4.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Net sales at the Electricity Segment increased 7.6% year over year to $193.8 million.

The company reported cash used in operating activities of $3.9 million during first-quarter 2015 compared to cash flow of $66.8 million in the prior-year quarter.The debt-to-capitalization ratio was 35.8% as of Mar 31, 2015 as against 31.2% as of Dec 31, 2014. Free cash flow in the reported quarter was negative $13 million compared with a positive $58 million in the first quarter of 2014. Free cash flow in the reported quarter was impacted by a number of significant cash payments, including tax payments, settlement of a legal matter, variable compensation disbursements and restructuring payments.In Jan 2015, Itron repurchased 335,251 shares for about $132.8 million. The repurchases were made under the $50 million 2014 share repurchase plan. On a cumulative basis, the company repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares under this plan.In Feb 2015, Itron's board authorized a new plan to repurchase up to $50 million shares during a 12-month period. During the quarter, the company repurchased 84,000 shares for $30.6 million under the 2015 plan.On May 4, Itron announced that it will work with Eletrobras, a major Brazilian electric utility and the largest power utility in Latin America, to modernize its electric grid. Eletrobras will implement Itron's OpenWay Riva solution - the first-of-its-kind technology featuring adaptive communications technology and distributed computing power to support new smart grid applications on Cisco's IPv6 network.Itron also announced that John Holleran, the company's executive vice president (EVP) and chief operating officer (COO) will be departing Itron effective the end of 2015.

e have issued an updated research report on  on Apr 23, 2015. Performance of this provider of liquid flow measurement products and control technology will be hurt by weakening oil and gas sector, negative impact of foreign exchange, volatile raw material prices and strong competition.On Apr 20, Badger Meter reported a 9.4% year-over-year decline in earnings to 29 cents per share in the first quarter of 2015, primarily affected by the downturn in the oil & gas market, severe winter weather as well as a weaker euro. Earnings were also quite short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate with a negative earnings surprise of around 28%.The company expects foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the near term. Badger Meter also witnessed a significant decline in sales to the oil and gas market due to lower purchases by a major customer in the first quarter. Weakness in the oil and gas sector will likely continue to impact the company's performance.Prior to Badger Meter's introduction of its proprietary radio products, ORION and GALAXY, Itron, Inc.'s  water utility-related products were leading radio products contributor to the company's results. Itron products are sold under an agreement between Badger Meter and Itron that has been renewed multiple times and is in effect until early 2016.In recent years, many of Badger Meter's customers have selected its proprietary products over Itron products. While Badger Meter's proprietary product sales are generally greater than those of the Itron licensed products, the company expects that Itron products will remain a significant component of sales to water utilities.Notably, the electric utility industry relies on advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technology for two-way communication to monitor and control electrical devices at customer sites. Although, Badger Meter does not sell products for electric market applications, the trend toward AMI affects the markets in which the company participates, particularly for customers interested in more frequent and diverse data collection in the water utility market.Similar to the electric utility industry, a few years ago, the water utility industry is beginning to see the adoption of electronic water meters. Specifically, AMI and AMA technologies enable water utilities to capture readings from each meter at more frequent and variable intervals. Further, Electronic water metering has lower barriers to entry, which could also affect the competitive environment in North America.Badger Meter's reliance on single suppliers for most brass castings and certain electronic subassemblies in several of its product lines may also affect its performance. The company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs.Moreover the weakening oil and gas sector, strong competition and negative impact of foreign exchange rates remain headwinds for the company.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has witnessed downward estimate revisions over the last 7 days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 decreased roughly 2.4% to $2.44 per share and fell 1.4% to $2.74 per share for 2016.Stocks to consider at the moment include Thermon Group Holdings, Inc.  and Analog Devices, Inc.  , both carrying carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Second quarter glass volumes are expected to increase in the low single-digit percentage rate with price declines moderating further.Optical Communications sales are expected to grow at a mid-teens percentage rate year over year due to continued strength in carrier and enterprise networks, Environmental to be down mid-single digits impacted by a weaker euro, Specialty Materials to decline at a mid-single digit rate due to advanced optics weakness and Life Sciences to be also decline slightly on account of currency.Corning didn't mention any change in the effective tax rate for the year, which may be assumed to remain at 18% and full-year capex $1.3-1.4 billion.Corning's first-quarter earnings were ahead of expectations, sending shares up. All major segments exceeded expectations and integration of CPM is also yielding desired results.Currency remains a major headwind, however, because of the strengthening dollar versus the yen, but Corning has hedge contracts in place that are expected to protect its results. Management has said that 100% of 2015 earnings, 80% of 2016 earnings and 70% of 2017 earnings have been hedged under the new program.The company is also returning cash to investors both as share repurchases and dividends, increasing the dividend by 20% last December and authorizing a new share repurchase program of $1.5 billion.Corning shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

hares of  climbed more than 10%, touching $64.94, before closing at $64.81, following an upgrade from Equal Weight to Overweight by Barclays' analyst Blayne Curtis. In addition, the analyst increased the price target to $70.00 from $55.00.Per a recent deal win, Analog Devices' high accuracy converter chip will be used by Apple  for the upcoming iPhone and iPads which will enable the 3D Touch feature. The 3D/Force Touch technology allows users to modulate the pressure when they touch the screen. This touch feature uses tiny electrodes around the display to differentiate between a light tap and a deep press.Curtis expects iPhone 6S (expected to be released this year) to have the 3D touch feature, followed by iPads in 2016. According to him, this new design win could be accretive to Analog Devices' earnings by 80 cents in 2016, extending benefits in 2017 as well.Moreover, the analyst remains optimistic about the benefits received from the Hittite Microwave LLC merger. The acquisition complements Analog Devices' commitment to offer high frequency chips and other signal processors, increasing its cost synergies and revenues, going forward.Additionally, Curtis believes that Analog Devices remains well positioned in the growing industrial and automotive markets. The company's new products will continue to see very strong deployment in the emerging automotive market, further expanding its share in the sensor market.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $59.74/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $45 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.3% return against the $45 commitment, or a 2.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ADI's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $45 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Analog Devices, Inc. sees its shares fall 24.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $42.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.40 from $45), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.9% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 2.9% figure actually exceeds the 2.7% annualized dividend paid by Analog Devices, Inc., based on the current share price of $59.74. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 24.81% to reach the $45 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.7% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Analog Devices, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $45 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $45 strike for the 2.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Analog Devices, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $59.74) to be 22%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Agree To Purchase Analog Devices At $45, Earn 5.3% Using Options@2015-03-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agree-purchase-analog-devices-45-earn-53-using-options-2015-03-25

" Shares of  soared on Monday after Barclays upgraded the stock on the belief that the company's products will be used to enable  's recently announced Force Touch feature in upcoming devices. As of 11:45 Monday morning, the stock was up nearly 10%. Apple introduced Force Touch, a technology that allows different results based on how hard a user presses on a screen or touchpad, earlier this year, and it's already being used in the Apple Watch as well as the new 12"" MacBook.  reported a few weeks ago that the next iPhone will also support the technology.One type of integrated circuit required for Force Touch is an analog-to-digital converter, which takes an analog signal, in this case resulting from the user pressing on the screen, and converts it to a digital signal that can be used by the software. Barclays believes that Analog Devices has secured a place for its high-accuracy converters in Apple's upcoming iPhone and iPad lineup.Barclays puts the impact for Analog Devices at $0.80 per share of additional EPS during 2016, stating that Analog Devices has the best converters in the industry, and that Apple should be willing to pay for quality. An $0.80 boost to EPS would be significant for Analog Devices. Analysts are expecting 2016 non-GAAP EPS to come in at $3.21 per share, and this Apple deal, if it turns out to be more than a rumor, would add nearly 25% to Analog Devices' 2016 earnings, given the estimated numbers.This extra business would give a much-needed boost to Analog Devices, which has seen its revenue and earnings decline since 2011. The stock trades at more than 30 times earnings despite this fact, baking in quite a bit of optimism about the company's future.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

"n Monday,  user ""Mr Connected"" posted a  from  upgrading shares of chipmaker,  . Barclays said Analog Devices had ""secured multiple sockets across  's iPhone/iPad lineup to enable the 3D/Force Touch feature.""The note says Force Touch should show up in the iPhone starting with the iPhone 6s, and the feature might come to iPads next year. This could be a major win for Analog Devices, according to Barclays. The note says the iPhone should require a single chip from Analog Devices, with larger-screen devices using multiple chips (up to three for a 12-inch device, per the note). Barclays also thinks, over the long term, the multichip solutions ""are likely replaced by more advanced, higher [average selling price] single-chip solution.""Further out, the converter chip that helps enable this Force Touch capability could be integrated with 2D touch functionality ""into a single super chip,"" potentially increasing average selling prices for Analog Devices, according to the Barclays note.Finally, with respect to Apple, the note says the Force Touch opportunity ""could drive $0.80+ in incremental [earnings per share]"" during calendar 2016. Barclays also believes Analog Devices has an attractive ""multi-year roadmap"" and could even ""suck in other content over time."" The note says Analog Devices is ""well positioned beyond [Apple],"" citing potential revenue and cost benefits from its acquisition of Hittite Microwave. It also says Analog Devices is ""seeing continued strength in the Industrial [market]"" and could see an ""acceleration in Automotive."" According to data from  , analysts expect Analog Devices to generate $3.3 billion in revenue and $2.91 in earnings per share for 2015. Moving into next year, the analyst consensus is for $3.5 billion in revenue (up 5.9%) and $3.23 in earnings per share.The stock does not look terribly cheap at about 21.6 times expected 2015 earnings and 19.5 times 2016 earnings. However, if this Apple opportunity materializes as Barclays anticipates, then those 2016 earnings estimates could rise significantly. All told, Barclays believes the stock has upside to $70 per share. This would represent an increase of about 11% from current price levels. The average one-year price target for the stock among the analysts who cover it, per the  website, is $62 with Barclays being one of the more bullish forecasts. Analog Devices stock jumped 10% following the publication of the Barclays note and now trades above the consensus analyst price target. If Barclays is correct and Analog Devices indeed won the Apple Force Touch business, then this could lead to further upgrades and upward estimate revisions.However, if the next iPhone does nort incorporate this Force Touch feature  Analog Devices does not have the design win Barclays thinks it does, then the stock could quickly give up these gains and then some.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Debt-to-capitalization ratio increased to 38.9% as of Dec 31, 2014 from 23.5% as of Dec 31, 2013.Watts Water repurchased 174,000 shares during the fourth quarter, at a cost of $10.5 million, as part of the previously announced $90 million share repurchase program. Throughout year, the company repurchased approximately 669,700 shares at a cost of approximately $39.6 million.On Dec 1, 2014, Watts Water acquired AERCO International, Inc. (AERCO) for $264.5 million. The acquisition will help expand Watts Water's product portfolio to the strategically important and related heat and hot water offerings.Moreover, Watts Water announced transformation initiatives in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, initially focusing on portfolio rationalization and global sourcing as well as margin expansion. These efforts will drive long-term growth for the company. Watts Water anticipates that by 2017, the sourcing and product rationalization effort will expand its consolidated operating margins by 1.5 percentage points.Watts Water posted record adjusted earnings of $2.51 per share for 2014, which increased 13% year over year. Earnings, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 per share. Including special items, earnings were at $1.42 per share for the year compared with $1.71 in 2013.Revenues for the full year increased 3% year over year to a record $1.51 billion from $1.47 billion in 2013. Revenues came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For the full year, organic sales increases in the Americas and Asia-Pacific of 5.5% and 22.6%, respectively, were partially offset by a 3.1% reduction in organic sales in EMEA, as compared with 2013.Watts Water expects organic growth between 4% and 6% in 2015 in the Americas, over 2014, excluding AERCO and the effect of sales of the transformation effort and potential negative forex impact related to the Canadian dollar. The company estimates that the Canadian dollar will negatively affect overall Americas' sales by 0.5% to 1% year over year.In Asia-Pacific, Watts Water guided organic top-line growth of around 20%, excluding the effect of any transformation exercise. However, the company remains uncertain about EMEA, where it expects organic sales reduction in the range of 1% and 3% year over year.Further, AERCO's sales is expected to increase by 10% in 2015 from its 2014 run rate of approximately $100 million.The company is optimistic about quantitative easing which is likely to facilitate incremental activity. Although, with instabilities in Greece, persistent tensions in Ukraine, sanctions on Russia and drop in energy prices it will be difficult for the company to match its 2015 guidance.However, emerging markets in the EMEA region will continue to facilitate growth, as infrastructure and investment in the Middle East and Eastern Europe continue to grow. Nevertheless, the Middle East is project-driven, and recent drop in oil prices as well as adverse impact of currency translation could affect project funding and the expected timing of projects in the region.Watts Water expects enhanced demand for its products in China. The company also anticipates consistent growth in Tier 2 cities, especially in key verticals such as hotels, office space and data centers in the country. However, the housing market in China appears to be contracting with a decline in both home values and new housing projects.The company will benefit from growth in new residential construction, repair and replace activity, along with commercial recovery in North America and expansion into the Chinese markets. Even though the transformation program and restructuring actions in Europe will lead to cost savings, volumes will remain weak.Watts Water, which operates through its subsidiaries, is a leading manufacturer of innovative products that control the efficiency, safety and quality of water within applications (residential, commercial, and institutional).At present, Watts Water carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks to consider in the same industry include Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (  ), Analog Devices, Inc. (  ) and Alliance Fiber Optic Products Inc. (  ). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This is a diversified market for the company which includes the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments. Communications generated 26% of total revenue, down 4% sequentially but up 45% year over year. The Automotive segment generated around 16% of Analog Devices' first-quarter revenues, down 8% sequentially and 1% from the year-ago quarter. The Consumer segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with the computing and handset businesses, was up 1% sequentially and 27% year over year. It accounted for 12% of the total revenue.Reported gross margin was 65.2%, up 550 basis points (bps) sequentially and 10 bps year over year backed by favorable product mix.Analog Devices reported operating expenses of $271.9 million, up 19.9% from $226.8 million incurred in the earlier-year quarter. Research & development expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from the comparable quarter last year, while selling, marketing and general & administrative expenses remained flat.

"Shutterstock photoA nalog Devices, among the world's most prominent producers of analog chips used in wireless network equipment, is poised to continue profiting from solid demand for increasingly advanced semiconductor content, including in cars and trucks, analysts say.""Of all the various end markets thatAnalog Devices (  ) sells into, we are most optimistic about automotive,"" Morningstar analyst Brian Colello said in an interview.He says the global auto segment has been strong and should continue so because of increasing demand for electronic content that is used to bolster everything from entertainment systems to safety sensors in automobiles. He expects this to continue indefinitely, as consumers show they are willing to pay for more tech-driven conveniences in their cars and trucks and as governments in various parts of the world steadily mandate new safety standards.""This is a secular trend, and ADI is growing nicely with that trend,"" Colello said.Strong  over the past year provided extra benefit. Autodata reported that U.S. sales of cars and light trucks climbed 5.9% in 2014 to more than 16.5 million, the best sales performance since 2006. ""We think of that as icing on the cake,"" Colello said.Analog Devices' chips are used to convert ""real-world signals"" such as readings of sound and temperature into digital signals, as Colello noted in a recent report to clients. In that report, he says Analog Devices has carved out a big presence in the lucrative analog chip realm -- it controls about half the market in data converter chips, for instance, according to Morningstar.Because analog chips ""are neither particularly expensive nor do they require cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, high-quality analog chip makers tend to be able to maintain healthy pricing yet generate strong profitability over time,"" Colello wrote.The Norwood, Mass.-based company's established position in the industry, he says, also should help it sustain growth.""Once electronics manufacturers select an analog chip, they tend to stick with the chip for the life of the device because it is costly to redesign a device in order to swap in a competing chip that might not necessarily be compatible with the rest of the product,"" Colello wrote.Colello told IBD that while demand for Analog Devices' chips is increasingly evident in autos, a need for the ever-advancing technology is abundant in myriad corners of the company's broader industrial and communications businesses -- from more sensors used in medical equipment to more accurately monitor heart rates, for example, to technology used to send data wirelessly from a meter at a residence back to a utility company, as opposed to that company sending someone out to physically check the meter.Sales growth has actually been even stronger in these two categories, though the analyst looks for the auto contribution to continue to hold great potential.For Analog Devices' fiscal 2014, which ended at the close of October, the company reported a profit of $2.39 per share, up 11% from a year earlier. Revenue totaled nearly $2.9 billion, up 9%.The automotive business accounted for 18% of revenue and grew 9% from a year earlier, while the industrial segment accounted for 47% and grew 10%. The third prong of Analog Devices' operation, its communications business, accounted for 24% and grew 29%, as wireless carriers around the world continue building out 3G and 4G networks. Consumer, the fourth business niche, accounted for 11% of revenue, and that declined 20%.For its first fiscal quarter of 2015, analysts on average expect the company to produce earnings of 61 cents per share, up from 49 cents a year earlier, on revenue of $760.6 million, which would mark a 21% increase, according to a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts. Analog Devices is scheduled to report Feb. 17.For all of fiscal 2015, Wall Street projects earnings of $2.83 per share, a gain of 18%, on a revenue increase of 14%, to nearly $3.3 billion. Contributing to the gains this year will be Analog Devices' $2 billion acquisition of Hittite Microwave in July 2014. The acquisition gave Analog additional technical capabilities across its three main business groups.A spokeswoman said executives could not comment for this article because the company had entered a quiet period ahead of reporting quarterly earnings this month. But Vincent Roche, Analog Devices' CEO, said at a conference in December that investors ""can expect to see the revenue synergies"" from the Hittite deal become significant toward the end of fiscal 2015.""So around then I think with the pipeline of opportunity that we have, and the things that Hittite was working on, we'll start to see the revenue synergies starting ..."" he said. ""And I think 2016 is when we'll start to see a meaningful contribution in terms of the multiplication factor of Hittite with ADI.""On growth prospects in the auto arena, Roche spoke optimistically. He said that the number of sensors used in cars is expected to continue growing steadily for several years. ""So there's a tremendous opportunity,"" he said. And of auto manufacturers, ""they're all becoming IT companies in some way now.""Roche said that between the acquisition of Hittite and ongoing demand for chips, ""we think we can grow this business at two to three times (U.S.) GDP, so that is somewhere in the region of 6% to 9% a year. ... Notwithstanding the cyclicality in our industry, but over time, I think we can achieve at least the midpoint of those growth projections and possibly on the higher end depending on how well the acquisition of Hittite actually plays out.""Colello said he views Roche's outlook as realistic, owing in large part to steady demand for more electronic content. ""We think it is reasonable,"" Colello said. ""The near-term picture is still very bright.""Though well-positioned, Analog Devices is hardly an island of prosperity in its industry. It competes on various fronts with several heavyweights, and so, analysts say, can't afford missteps with the integration of Hittite that might send future customers to existing rivals.Analog Devices ranks sixth largest, by market cap, among 43 firms in IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing group, which is dominated in size byIntel (  ) andTaiwan Semiconductor (  ). Also larger than Analog Devices areTexas Instruments (  ),Micron Technology (  ) andQorvo (QRVO).Also, analyst Doug Freedman of RBC Capital Markets told IBD, the semiconductor industry tends to be cyclical and major players often see their sales ebb and flow. He also noted that while economic growth appears to be gathering momentum in the U.S., growth is slowing in large pockets of Europe and Asia.He also said that the semiconductor industry average growth rate is roughly in line with GDP, which would suggest that the growth expectations of Analog Devices' chief executive could prove aggressive.Freedman calls Analog Devices a ""strong"" and ""reliable"" company and notes that its stock has had boom periods in recent years. Analog Devices stock rose 21% in 2013 and 9% in 2014, and is down about 1% this year. Shares ran up 36% from mid-October to mid-December and were last trading around 55.Several companies with chips or other tech products for  at the moment, among themAmbarella (AMBA), IBD Leaderboard stockNXP Semiconductors (NXPI),Skyworks Solutions (SWKS),Harman International Industries (HAR) andNvidia (NVDA).  on Feb. 5 and  on Jan. 28.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analog Devices Champs At Bit On Chip Demand For Cars@2015-02-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-champs-bit-chip-demand-cars-2015-02-09

 (  ) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Feb 17. Last quarter, the company posted a 1.47% positive earnings surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog's fourth-quarter 2014 earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. Revenues of $814.2 million were up sequentially as well as year over year driven by growth across all its product lines. However, total end customer orders, including original equipment manufacturer and distribution, were down sequentially.The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from Industrial and Communication markets, which are witnessing strong demand. The increased 4G deployments in China and the U.S. will continue to boost growth in these markets, going forward. Also, the acquisition of Hittite Microwave (closed in the third quarter), a provider of high frequency chips and signal processors, will strengthen the company's presence in both these end markets, expanding its revenue base.For the first quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $745-$775 million and non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 65%. Earnings per share are expected in the 58-64 cents range.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 61 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Analog Devices' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3:Impax Laboratories Inc.

road-based growth across all product lines helped  (  ) deliver healthy third-quarter fiscal 2015 results. Microchip reported GAAP net income of $86.1 million or 39 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with $105.4 million or 48 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP earnings was largely attributable to higher operating expenses and higher number of shares outstanding for the reported quarter.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported quarter was $143.3 million or 64 cents per share compared with $132.9 million or 61 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Recurring earnings (with stock-based compensation adjustments) were 60 cents per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents.Net revenue (GAAP) for the reported quarter was $528.7 million, up 9.6% year over year, aided by strong sales of microcontrollers and analog products. The quarterly revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $526 million.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 64.5% of the total revenue in the quarter ($345.5 million). Microcontroller revenues in calendar year 2014 were up 13.8% year over year, setting an all-time record for each of the three microcontroller segments. The company also registered record sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in calendar year 2014. While the 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 27.7% for the year, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up 41.3% with new design wins and applications.The microcontroller business continued to outperform the industry and enabled Microchip to gain significant market share. Microchip expects to continue this momentum to further strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.Revenues from the analog products were up 15.3% from the year-ago quarter to $125.5 million, representing 23.4% of the total revenue.

"he current extended bull market is both exciting and scary.The higher the market goes, the more nervous investors become about the risk of a crash. Such skittishness sometimes prompts dramatic overreactions to relatively minor performance issues -- even with the best companies. Astute long-term investors love when this happens because it can create brief opportunities to buy great stocks at more attractive valuations.The well-known metal parts and castings fabricator  is a perfect example of this.Precision Castparts is a  leader that has been around for more than six decades. During that time, it evolved from a tiny provider of chain saw cutters to a diversified giant worth $32 billion. The company now makes specialized metal castings, parts, forgings and fasteners for multiple industries including aerospace, energy, healthcare and defense.The company has a superb long-term track record. Annual revenues have risen nearly 13% a year since 2006, from $3.6 billion to a projected $10.3 billion in fiscal (March) 2015. During the same period, earnings per share raised at a 21% pace, to an expected $13.50 a share in fiscal 2015. The gross, operating and net margins are all at decade highs, as is free cash flow.Yet shares of Precision Castparts are down about 15% over the trailing twelve months, compared with more than a 10% gain for the S&P 500.So what gives? Wall Street appears to be overreacting to small earnings misses in three of the past four quarters.
  
Source:Yahoo! FinanceNote: Fiscal year ends in March. Data shown are for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2014 and for Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2015While any cluster of earnings misses could be a red flag, I am not overly concerned in this case. Precision Castparts can have the occasional bout of hiccups because of customer-related factors, such as last-minute decisions to push back delivery dates in response to changing production schedules.It's the sort of thing the firm has faced more often in recent quarters. In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, for example, the bottom line lagged expectations by 3%. The quarter was marked by some unprecedented dynamics, said CEO Mark Donegan, with customers significantly shifting delivery schedules very late in the quarter -- too late to prevent the changes from dragging down the bottom line.While this unfortunate run of bad luck should be relatively brief, it may not quite be over. When discussing company performance for the latest quarter, Q2 of fiscal 2015, Donegan cautioned that some customers asked that late-December deliveries be postponed until January as a year-end cost-management strategy. So there's a chance Precision Castparts could disappoint in the current quarter, too.If that happens, then shares may come under renewed pressure, though this would simply boost the value proposition for this stock.Precision Castparts is poised for years of further double-digit growth largely because of rapid expansion of its aerospace business, which is seeing steady demand for airframe and engine components in developed and emerging markets. Aerospace products now account for 68% of sales, compared with about 60% a few years ago.As key commercial aircraft programs at major aerospace firms, like Airbus Group N.V. (  ) and The Boeing Company (NYSE:  ), start to ramp up, PCP should feel a direct top-line boost.The company's relationship with Airbus is a fairly new development, thanks to a $625 million acquisition of Aerospace Dynamics International (  ) in March 2014, which was already a key supplier to the Airbus A350. That plane should draw a significant portion of the $1.9 trillion in wide-body sales projected for the next two decades.The ADI deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015, also provides some much-needed diversification. Prior to the ADI purchase, Precision Castparts was mainly exposed to the commercial aircraft market through Boeing, most recently by providing millions of dollars in landing gear fasteners, engine parts and other components for every 787 Dreamliner -- Boeing's newest wide-body passenger jet.The heavy reliance on Boeing became a concern in early 2013, when the FAA temporarily grounded the entire 787 fleet for battery problems, which had resulted in some emergency landings. Fortunately, the battery glitch was resolved and Precision Castparts emerged relatively unscathed. But the damage might have been substantially worse if the 787 had more serious issues leading to long production delays. Having two major wide-body customers will better shield Precision Castparts from such risks.So will a strong presence in two unrelated areas -- the power and industrial markets, which generate 18% and 14% of sales, respectively. On the power side, management expects particularly strong demand for gas turbines for use in power plant construction and retrofits.The $2.9-billion acquisition of Titanium Metals Corporation (aka Timet) in November 2012 filled a significant void in the industrial business by adding a unique line of high-performance titanium parts for factory equipment. In fiscal 2014, industrial product sales grew 10% to nearly $1.4 billion, mainly because of the addition of Timet, management says.Considering the strength of Precision Castparts' end markets and how quickly the firm has increased earnings in recent years, consensus estimates for growth of 13% annually seem conservative. Still, even that pace would push per-share profits up to $23.60 in five years. At the current earnings multiple of 19, this suggests the potential for a roughly 90% stock price gain during that time, to around $448.Risks To Consider:  Investors seeking superior capital gains should consider establishing or adding to a long position in Precision Castparts. With a yield of just 0.1%, the stock isn't appropriate for income investors. Since we first began publishing this annual research report in 2003, our picks have beaten the overall market eight out of 12 years, including years with average gains of 37%… 38%… and 39%.

 (  ) is set to report the fourth-quarter 2014 results on Nov 25. Last quarter, the company posted in-line results. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog's third-quarter 2014 earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Revenues of $727.8 million were up sequentially as well as year over year driven by growth across all the product lines. Additionally, total end customer orders, including original equipment manufacturer and distribution improved in the last quarter.However, gross margins contracted in the quarter due to lower utilization rates and an unfavorable mix.For the fourth quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $790-$820 million and non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 66.2%. Earnings per share are expected in the 66-70 cents range.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Most Accurate estimate stands at 66 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 68 cents. That is a difference of -2.94%. Analog Devices' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 such as:Casey's General Stores, Inc. (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +10.91% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Bob Evans Farms, Inc.

 (  ) or TI recently expanded its industrial microcontroller portfolio with the launch of a new series of MSP43 industrial microcontrollers (MCUs), MSP430i204x. These MCUs are now available in production quantities for USD $1.70 per 1,000 units.The MSP430i204x is designed to provide precision, accuracy and cost savings and meets the temperature range requirements from -40 to 105 degrees Celsius essential for industrial applications. These are available in small package sizes, which will allow developers to make smaller products for industrial applications by reducing board space and increasing system accuracy.The MSP430i204x industrial MCUs consist of integrated smart analog and up to four integrated sigma delta analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The ADCs will enable the MCUs to provide accuracy and precision down to 1% in smart metering products. The MCUs also containa digitally controlled oscillator (DCO),which helps inremoving the need for an external crystal.TI is in the process of invigorating its product line and most of the recent growth in the embedded business is attributable to microcontrollers.Leveraging the latest MCUs will enable high performance in applications with smarter metering solutions and help to detect unauthorized access. Moreover, the latest products will enhance Texas Instruments' differentiated product pipeline, thereby boosting revenues. However, Texas Instruments operates in an intensely competitive industry and companies such as Broadcom (  ) and Analog Devices (  ) can pose stiff competition.Texas Instruments reported strong third-quarter earnings that grew 19.6% sequentially and 29.1% year over year. Revenues of $3.50 billion were up 6.3% sequentially and 7.9% year over year. Gross margin of 58.4% was up 124 basis points (bps) sequentially and 354 bps from the year-ago quarter.Texas Instruments currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The increase was driven by strong growth in all sub segments, including industrial automation, instrumentation, aerospace and energy sectors. generated 27% of total revenue, up 31% sequentially and 56% year over year, driven by strong wireless infrastructure sales. Continued 4G deployments drove higher sales in this end market.Management expects wireless growth to continue in the next year as a result of increasing 4G LTE deployments in China and the U.S. The company's technology in these wireless applications is focused on the radio signal chain, where spectrum is digitized and radio architectures lead to higher ADI content per system, driving demand for the company's products.The  segment generated around 17% of Analog Devices' fourth-quarter revenues, up 3% sequentially and 2% from the year-ago quarter, driven by continued strength in North American and Chinese vehicle markets, increasing content per vehicle and growth in worldwide premium vehicle sales.Management continues to believe that growth in worldwide luxury vehicle will lead to solid automotive revenues in the near term. The growing electronic content in vehicles will remain a positive, with demand for products like driver assistance and powertrain efficiency systems remaining strong.The  segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with the computing and handset businesses, was up 14% sequentially but down 3% year over year. It accounted for 11% of the total revenue.Reported gross margin was 59.7%, down 570 basis points (bps) sequentially and 590 bps year over year.

The increased 4G deployments in China and the U.S. will continue to improve growth in these markets, going forward.The company saw weak order momentum in the reported quarter. However, management expects solid operating leverage beginning from second quarter on improving factory utilization and a favorable mix of business.Additionally, the Hittite Microwave acquisition (closed in the third quarter) will continue to help Analog Devices offer high frequency chips and other signal processors. Hittite's offerings will strengthen the company's presence in the Industrial and Communication end markets.However, the company's high cost structure due to continuous investments and increasing competition in the analog market could be a matter of concern in the near future.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

opular multinational technology provider  (  ) will release its third-quarter 2014 results before the market opens on Oct 22. MKS Instruments had generated positive earnings surprise of 50.00% in the preceding quarter. Let's figure out how things are shaping up before the imminent earnings publication.MKS Instruments enjoys high brand value in the market and is well known for offering non-imitable technological products and services worldwide. Increasing demand in the semiconductor industry is augmenting the company's organic revenue growth. Also, growing demand for the company's products in the Asian market signify an improvement in its global footprint.MKS Instruments' improving financial strength bodes well for its business development programs in the long run. The company, by introducing greater product diversification within its manufacturing facilities, has successfully increased its aggregate sales. Moreover, accretive acquisitions have facilitated its product diversification process. The acquisition of Granville-Phillips is expected to generate annual revenue of $30 million and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.12 for full year 2014.However, the international business affairs of MKS Instruments are prone to severe currency and exchange rate risks. Furthermore, economic, political and social turmoils in international marketplaces are likely to partially influence its revenue and profitability in the long run. Some products manufacturing processes of MKS Instruments involve long production tenures and hence experience mounting costs. In the face of severe market rivalry threats, the company makes large investments regarding technological innovations in order to differentiate its services within the semiconductor industry. However, these products often become technologically obsolete within a small span of time, thus causing substantial loss.Our proven model does not conclusively show that MKS Instruments is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for MKS Instruments, is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock stand at 37 cents per share, indicating in-line earnings.MKS Instruments' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise predictions difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum.Here are some companies in the industry that shareholders may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Xcerra Corporation (  ) with Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy).Thomson Reuters Corporation (  ) with Earnings ESP of +2.22% and a Zacks Rank # 3.Analog Devices, Inc.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.48), with the stock changing hands as low as $49.33 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.

hipmaker  (  ) announced its restructuring strategy under which it plans to shut down its aging factories and shrink its workforce. The company is realigning its manufacturing capabilities to improve supply chain flexibility as it shifts production to external manufacturers.The restructuring involves elimination of the company's internal five-inch and reduction of its six-inch wafer fabrication lines, which will result in factories being closed down in West Jordan, Utah; Penang, Malaysia; and Bucheon, South Korea. The changes will take effect between second and fourth quarter of 2015. The closure may affect around 15% of Fairchild's global workforce of 9,000 employees.Fairchild, a maker of high-performance semiconductors, estimates that the company may need to incur about $36 million as restructuring and other charges. Non-cash charges roughly amounting to $25 million were projected on account of accelerated depreciation. Post-restructuring, the company estimates annual savings to the tune of $45 to $55 million.Operations at more sophisticated plants in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania; South Portland, Maine; and Bucheon are set to continue.The restructuring initiatives have taken form as the company shifts from manufacturing 5- and 6-inch wafers to the more powerful and efficient 8-inch silicon wafers. Rather than remodeling the smaller-wafer facilities to make 8-inch wafers, the chipmaker decided to shut down the outdated facilities entirely.The San Jose, CA-based company is following the industry trend as it cuts down internal production and shifts to external manufacturing sources. The restructuring actions will improve product quality and cost efficiency. Moreover, the move is set to streamline its global manufacturing footprint and increase the flexibility required to adapt the latest market trend.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company predominantly competes with Analog Devices, Inc. (  ), NXP Semiconductors NV (  ) and Texas Instruments Inc. (  ). It also supplies high-performance semiconductors for multiple end-markets. Fairchild's products are used in computer, telecommunications, automotive, consumer and industrial applications.Fairchild has lately been focusing more on industrial and appliance markets.

 (  ) second-quarter 2014 earnings of 42 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. The increase in profitability was driven by broad-based growth in the majority of Trimble's businesses, partially offset by weakness in the agriculture business. Also, higher gross margins and solid execution aided earnings growth in the quarter.Trimble's second-quarter revenues of $642.2 million were up 6.2% sequentially and 11.4% year over year. Also, second-quarter revenues were above the company's guided range of $605-$630 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $621.0 million. Revenues were driven by strong performance in the Engineering & Construction and Advanced Devices segments.The Engineering and Construction (E&C), Field Solutions (TFS), Mobile Solutions (TMS) and Advanced Devices (AD) segments generated 57%, 18%, 19% and 6% of total revenue, respectively.E&C unit revenues of $368.1 million were up 17.4% sequentially and 19% year over year. The most important markets within E&C are heavy and highway, large-scale commercial, small-scale commercial and housing as well as survey instruments.The increase was attributable to continuing market penetration, with some improvement seen in Europe and ongoing improvement in the U.S. residential and commercial market. Also, the use of advanced technology, including computerized design tools, estimating software, scheduling software, geospatial instruments, machine control and on-site alignment tools, have led to the growth of E&C business.TFS revenues of $114.5 million were down 1.2% sequentially and 17.2% year over year. The decrease was due to weaker sales in agricultural solutions, partially offset by growth in Geographical Information System (GIS) solutions.Though management expects agricultural business revenues to remain weak in the near term, it expects strong growth over the long term, driven by expansion in the new product categories and a higher rate of product introductions.TMS revenues of $122.9 million were up 6.4% sequentially and 3.6% from the comparable quarter of 2013. While core business contributed to growth, strong sales in the transportation and logistics market played the major role.The AD segment was up 16.9% sequentially but down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter to $36.8 million. The sequential increase was due to strength in several businesses in the portfolio.Trimble's gross margin for the quarter was 55.2%, up 110 basis points (bps) sequentially and 270 bps year over year. The increase was due to a favorable mix. Acquisitions added software to the portfolio, in turn, positively impacting the gross margin.Trimble reported operating expenses of $257.4 million, up 2.5% sequentially and 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense decreased from the year-ago quarter, while sales & marketing and general & administrative expenses increased. As a result, the operating margin was 15.1%, up 260 bps sequentially and 380 bps year over year.Pro-forma net income was $112.1 million or 42 cents compared with $92.1 million or 35 cents in the year-ago quarter. Pro-forma estimate in the second quarter excludes restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles, gain on an equity sale, acquisition-related costs and other adjustments on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock-based compensation. Our pro-forma estimate may not match management's presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.On a GAAP basis, Trimble recorded a net profit (for Trimble shareholders) of $77.8 million (29 cents per share) compared with $68.6 million (26 cents) in the previous quarter and a net profit of $54.6 million (21 cents) in the year-ago quarter.Inventories were up 2.9% sequentially to $274.4 million. Accounts receivables were $379.8 million, down from $397.7 million in the prior quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were down from around 56 days to 54 days.Trimble generated $131.2 million of cash from operations, up from $83.4 million in the prior quarter. Total debt (long-term plus short-term) at quarter-end stood at $655.9 million, down from $664.7 million in the first quarter.Management expects third-quarter revenues in the range of $590-$600 million, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $617 million. Earnings per share for the coming quarter on a GAAP basis are expected in the range of 19-24 cents and on a non-GAAP basis within 35-40 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 38 cents. The calculation of non-GAAP earnings per share excludes one-time charges such as amortization of intangibles worth $37.0 million, anticipated acquisition costs of $4.0 million and stock-based compensation of $11.0 million. The tax rate is expected in the range of 20-22%, while share count is likely to be 265.0 million.Trimble is witnessing much stronger construction markets and a few of its businesses are experiencing normal seasonality. Additionally, management's initiatives, such as lowering the cost structure, strategic acquisitions, product enhancements and international expansion appear to be paying off. However, quite a significant amount of its business, whether directly or indirectly, is dependent on government spending in the U.S. Though the softness in certain areas of business is related to macro concerns and the nature of new business acquired, improving trends in the domestic construction market and increasing adoption of technology in the agricultural market remain the secular growth drivers.Currently, Trimble has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Tuesday, shares of Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.48), with the stock changing hands as low as $49.28 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Analog Devices, Inc., looking at the history chart for ADI below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, ADI makes up 4.64% of the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSI) which is trading lower by about 0.9% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADI Dividend Yield Pushes Past 3%@2014-08-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adi-dividend-yield-pushes-past-3-2014-08-05

 (  ) shares have declined nearly 10% since the company reported fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings and provided a tepid guidance on Jul 24. Earnings excluding special items of 43 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Moreover, it was down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues at the Consumer, Industrial and Computing end markets and inventory reserves.Revenues in the reported quarter were $642.5 million, up 6.1% sequentially and 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential increase in revenues was primarily attributable to growth across all its main businesses and solid strength in its balanced portfolio, despite softness in the mobility business. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650.0 million.The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 35% of revenues compared with 38% in the prior quarter. The sequential decline was due to weakness in smartphones and tablets, mainly at its biggest customer.Mobility consumers are rapidly shifting toward the latest generation devices, while demand for prior generation products is falling at an increasing rate. Decline in previous generation smart devices at company's leading customer adversely affected the business. Older mobility products, specifically tablets, generated lower-than expected revenues.Maxim's expansion intopower management sensors, motion control, MEMS, audio amplifier and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices is proving to be beneficial as it secured design wins for its sensor technology. , Maxim's second largest segment, generated 27% of revenues compared with 31% in the prior quarter and grew 10% on a year-over-year basis.

 has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at ADI given that, according to its RSI reading of 25.46, it is now in oversold territory.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet, ADI's low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Analog Devices' earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 2 earnings estimate revision moves higher, compared with just none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for ADI has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $2.35/share two months ago to just $2.36/share right now.If this wasn't enough, Analog Devices also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) recently announced that it has entered a definitive agreement to acquire  (  ) for $2.0 billion or $78 per share in cash. The transaction, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, is expected to be closed by the end of third-quarter 2014.Massachusetts-based Hittite manufactures integrated circuits, modules and subsystems for radio frequency microwave and millimeter wave applications. The company's chips are used in cellular, optical and satellite communications, medical imaging and defense electronics. The company reported total revenue of $7.5 million in the first quarter, soaring 188% year over year.Analog Devices makes signal-processing microchips that are used in several consumer products, such as automobiles, personal computers, cellphones and tablets.

Therefore, the acquisition complements Analog Devices' commitment to offer high frequency chips and other signal processors.Hittite's offerings will strengthen Analog Devices' presence in the industrial and communications end markets. The strategic move aims to expand the company's existing product line-up to be used in satellite gear, military radar and cars, which require very high radio frequency (RF) chips and signal processors.For the past few decades, Analog Devices has been developing innovative products for the consumer, communications, automotive and industrial segments. The combined company would boast a wider selection of high-power, high-frequency chips by leveraging Hittite's leading position in RF, microwave, and millimeter wave technology. Additionally, the strategic deal is expected to boost Analog Devices' profitability.Reportedly, this deal happens to be the largest deal for Analog this year. Following the announcement of the deal, Analog shares jumped 4.97% to close at $55.31. The acquisition is expected to augment revenues, produce cost synergies, complement the company's product portfolio and generate economies of scale.Analog Devices reaffirmed its third-quarter 2014 guidance of 1-5% sequential revenues increase and pro-forma earnings in the 60-64 cents range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 62 cents.In the last reported quarter, earnings of 59 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.

"Shutterstock photoEmbedded systems maker Spansion has wasted no time making use of key technology it snapped up in 2013.A little less than a year after acquiring Fujitsu's microcontroller and analog business, that move is bearing fruit.In the first quarter,Spansion (  ) -- whose products power everything from Internet routers to consumer and automotive electronics -- saw its biggest sales and earnings growth in years.The company reported significant progress with acquired product lines and said it expects the microcontroller business to serve as a ""significant engine of growth"" for its expanding portfolio in mass markets, industrial, consumer and auto segments around the world.The strategy leading up to the buy was percolating a while.Once Spansion emerged from bankruptcy in 2010 and recapitalized a year later, a management team headed by CEO John Kispert shifted the company's position. Spansion went from a flash-memory chip maker targeting the wireless and embedded systems markets to one focused just on the embedded systems space, not wireless.Embedded systems are dedicated to specific tasks and found in everything from routers and thermostats to television set-top boxes and auto electronics.Spansion had been looking to buy companies with the additional technology it needed to execute effectively on its embedded systems strategy, Chief Financial Officer Randy Furr told IBD.So when Fujitsu Semiconductor, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Ltd. and a long-time strategic partner of Spansion announced it was divesting its microcontroller and analog business in the spring of 2013, Spansion offered to buy it for about $110 million plus about $65 million in inventory.Spansion announced the deal on May 1 and closed it on Aug. 1.Fast forward to the first quarter of 2014 and the acquisition has already given Spansion's business a jolt. After seeing profit growth declines on and off the past few years, Spansion's earnings soared 500% year over year to 18 cents a share in the first quarter. And its sales climbed 64% to $311.8 million.The growth spurt is expected to continue. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year earnings rising 66% to $1.26 a share after three straight years of declining earnings growth. They see a 51% lift in 2015 and a 26% rise in 2016.""The main thing that's driving the increase in revenue are the design wins in our microcontroller and analog businesses,"" Furr told IBD. ""That's been fueled by the acquisition.""Total design wins in the first quarter were around 775 compared with 470 a year earlier, when it had yet to close the acquisition, according to spokeswoman Michele Landry.Typical applications for the design wins include security surveillance, energy, robotics, automotive and factory automation.Why was the deal so attractive? ""At the time, Spansion had only flash memory and some logic capabilities,"" said Furr. ""We saw where combining flash memory with the microcontroller, analog, logic and graphics was where there would be a lot of opportunity for growth.""In order to execute on its strategy to expand its flash-memory-based solutions into the embedded systems space it needed to acquire additional technology, including both the microcontroller and analog technology, says Furr.A microcontroller is a small computer on a single integrated circuit designed for embedded applications. Analog semiconductors condition and regulate functions such as temperature in a thermostat. Flash memory is used to store the programs that run devices like set-top boxes and automotive electronics. It's a reprogrammable memory that retains information even with the power turned off.""It seemed to make almost the perfect fit for us in what was our strategy to grow the business,"" said Furr.What made the deal ""very compelling,"" was one-half of Fujitsu's microcontroller sales were into the automotive business, a market where Spansion is ""very strong,"" said Furr. ""What drove the acquisition was our strategy to combine these technologies of flash memory, microcontroller and analog along with graphics and logic onto one system on a chip.""A system-on-chip is a combination of different circuit modules on a single chip/die. This reduces the number of components/packages that you need to mount onto the board, which makes the board more reliable, says Landry. It allows Spansion customers to have greater security at faster speed and to do it at a lower cost, says Furr.""We're down a path now on combining our technology to come up with a system-on-chip solution for our embedded systems customers,"" he said.Spansion expects its first embedded system-on-a-chip product to come out toward the end of the year.""The acquisition of Fujitsu's microcontroller and analog business took Spansion into more stable markets than Nor flash memory, which prior to the acquisition accounted for 90% of Spansion's business,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Vijay Rakesh, who reiterated a buy rating on the company on May 27.A lot of microcontroller and analog products go into the automotive, industrial, communications and gaming markets, which are ""very stable"" markets and represent a 38% to 45% gross margin business, adds Rakesh.""The acquisition gave them more diversification away from Nor flash memory,"" he said. ""Now they are able to cross-sell a more complete solution with the microcontroller, analog and flash memory. They're better able to upsell into the automotive and telecommunications markets.""In the first quarter Spansion saw higher demand for the microcontroller and analog products it acquired, said Kispert in a statement.""Looking ahead, we see continued demand increasing for our stand-alone flash memory, microcontroller and analog products, as well as system-on-chip solutions,"" he said.So far the acquisition has exceeded expectations by some measures. When Spansion announced the transaction it gave a revenue range contribution of $450 million to $550 million on an annual basis and an operating profit margin estimate of 8% to 10%. The annualized run rate in the first quarter was a little over $560 million in revenue and operating profit was ""slightly better than the top end"" of the guidance it gave, says Furr.Is another acquisition possible? ""There's a chance there will be another acquisition given the success we've had with this transaction,"" said Furr. ""There are areas like the analog space where we would like to grow our business in the future. And doing it through an acquisition might make sense.""Spansion is ""working on a number of opportunities,"" he says, and a deal could be ""sooner rather than later, but timing is always difficult to predict.""Spansion serves customers worldwide directly or through distributors, who buy the products and resell them to original equipment makers and original design manufacturers.

 (  ) is set to report second-quarter 2014 results on May 20. Last quarter, the company posted 2.1% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog's first-quarter 2014 earnings were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by revenue growth across all product lines coupled with solid expense management. Additionally, total end customer orders improved in the last quarter, especially industrial communications and automotive markets.However, gross margins contracted in the quarter due to lower utilization rates and an unfavorable mix. On the other hand, operating margin of 29.6% was up 390 basis points from the year-ago quarter.For the second quarter, management expects revenues in the range of $660 to $680 million. Earnings per share are expected within 54-58 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 56 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Deviceswill beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 56 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Analog Deviceshas a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider other stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 such as: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +2.44% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. Its fourth quarter earnings were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and guidance was also encouraging. Though we remain concerned about competitive pressures across several markets, ADI is solidly positioned in secular growth markets and its products continue to see very strong deployment in the emerging automotive market. Given this backdrop, the order momentum in the last quarter is encouraging. We therefore reiterate our Neutral rating on the shares.Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts. The company is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.Semiconductor devices are broadly divided into three categories analog, digital and radio frequency (RF). Analog semiconductors condition and regulate real world information such as light, temperature, speed, pressure, power and electrical currents. Digital logic semiconductors process information in only two states. Mixed-signal semiconductors combine both analog and digital technology into a single device. Typically, an analog sensor samples real world information, and then converts the input into an electronic analog signal, which is converted into a digital format for further digital processing. The analog and mixed-signal markets tend to be more varied and specialized, with customized products that have longer life cycles than the digital industry segment. There is an ongoing drive to decrease the number of discrete devices, lessen power requirements and shrink the size of the existing devices, which correspondingly increase performance and reliability. Consequently, a greater amount of functionality is being consolidated into increasingly smaller devices.The product line is composed of amplifiers and comparators analog to digital converters digital to analog converters video encoders and decoders embedded processing products and DSPs MEMS and temperature sensors RF/IF components such as detectors, mixers/multipliers, modulators/demodulators, switches, transceivers and converters power and thermal management ICs, audio/video converters, amplifiers, CODECs, filters and processors analog, digital and RF switches and multiplexers analog microcontrollers clock and timing products voltage references interface products such as isolators, translators and transceivers wireless products such as baseband processing, cellular terminal chipsets, modulators and converters broadband products including amplifiers, CODECs, chipsets, splitters, clock and data recovery/retiming products and digital crosspoint switches fiber optic products including clock and data recovery/retiming products and laser drivers and amplifiers.In fiscal 2013, the company generated $2.6 billion in revenue, which was derived from four end markets Industrial, Communications, Consumer and Automotive. All businesses except automotive and communications markets declined in 2013. The automotive market saw strong growth for the fourth straight year.Analog Devices has manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts (California), Ireland and the Philippines. The company also uses outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third party subcontractors for back-end operations. It sells its products with the help of a huge direct sales force and sales offices spread across 17 countries including the U.S., as well as third party distributors, independent sales representatives and through the company website.The Americas and Europe were the largest served markets in 2013. The U.S. was the largest region within the Americas, with a 35% revenue share. Other countries in the Americas accounted for another 4%. Europe contributed 32% of total revenue (down 1.4% from 2012), China 13% (up 2.5%), Japan 11% (down 12.2%) and the rest of Asia 9% (down 4.4%).Analog Devices has a very large number of competitors, given the attractive markets in which it operates. These competitors range from pure analog players, such as Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology, Maxim Integrated Products and National Semiconductor to more diversified players, such as Texas Instruments and ST Microelectronics.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, Invesco Ltd (Symbol: IVZ) has taken over the #267 spot from Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Invesco Ltd (Symbol: IVZ), the market cap is now $15.99 billion, versus Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) at $15.88 billion.Below is a chart of Invesco Ltd versus Analog Devices, Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (IVZ plotted in blue; ADI plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of IVZ vs. ADI:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.At the closing bell, IVZ is up about 2.3%, while ADI is down about 0.9% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Invesco Takes Over #267 Spot From Analog Devices@2014-05-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/invesco-takes-over-267-spot-analog-devices-2014-05-01

ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH) where we have detected an approximate $89.5 million dollar inflow -- that's a 30.7% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 6,520,937 to 8,520,937). Among the largest underlying components of SMH, in trading today Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) is up about 1.3%, ASML Holding NV (Symbol: ASML) is up about 0.2%, and Analog Devices, Inc. (Symbol: ADI) is up by about 1.2%. The chart below shows the one year price performance of SMH, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SMH's low point in its 52 week range is $33.53 per share, with $45.49 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $45.30. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Semiconductor ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2014-03-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2014-03-25

" Have you ever wondered how your Apple (  ) iPad knows which way is up and which is down? Or how your digital camera's image stabilization feature works?The technology behind all of these features is motion sensing. In fact, it's the technology behind many of the fastest growing consumer tech categories.The smartphone and tablet features are just a small sample. Without motion sensors  wouldn't be able to replace the clunky dashboard GPS. Remote-controlled planes and aerial drones would never leave the ground.  , like fitness bands, wouldn't exist.As manufacturing costs come down and functionality goes up, we're going to see much more advanced sensing applications emerge in everyday consumer devices. And the features that seemed cutting-edge a year ago will show up in toys that we buy for our kids and grandchildren.And of course we'll see emerging technologies - things like self-driving cars and voice-controlled devices, introduced in this decade.The technology is amazing when you think about what's required to make all of these products as smart as they are. Tiny motion sensors in many consumer devices host a compass, an accelerometer and a gyroscope - without all three they wouldn't work. Together, these components tell the device how fast it's moving and how it's oriented.Analog Devices (  ) is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the motion-sensing space, with a market cap of $15.87 billion. STM Electronics (  ) is a slightly smaller manufacturer; its market cap is $7.6 billion.And for investors interested in smaller companies, there are a handful of earlier-stage companies that specialize in certain types of sensors for specific applications.Motion sensors have been a staple in consumer goods for years, but new advances are making them even smaller and more energy-efficient. That's allowing manufacturers to make sensors that are ""always on."" And this capability is behind the wearable devices that are able to track activity around the clock.I expect we'll see a much wider application of motion sensor technology in home applications over the coming years as well. Recent acquisitions, like Google's (  )  , show that large companies see growth in home appliances. The ""connected home"" will require sensors in every appliance in order to function.While motion sensors have been around for a while, I think investors would be wise to take a look at AMD, STM and some of the smaller companies to see what they have cooking. I see almost limitless consumer and industrial applications, and the companies that continue to push sensor technology forward are likely to be extremely lucrative investments.On Dec. 31, something incredible happened. For the first time in history, the majority of Internet traffic originated from NOT from PCs or desktops - but from mobile devices including smartphones and tablets. We're never going back. Mobile is taking over. And even though the biggest player in mobile, Apple, is selling over 200 million iPhones this year alone… here at Wyatt Research, we're recommending the one company no one is taking about. The one reaping massive profits each time a new Apple or Samsung smartphone is activated. In fact, as mobile data usage explodes in the year ahead, its stock is set to soar!

 (  ) is set to report first-quarter 2014 results on Feb 18. Last quarter, it posted 6.9% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog's fourth-quarter 2013 earnings were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by strong revenue growth coupled with better gross margins and solid expense management. Additionally, revenues were up sequentially driven by strength in the automotive segment.Gross margins expanded in the quarter attributable to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs. However, operating margin of 29.5% was down 150 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Analog provided a weak outlook for the first quarter, with revenues expected to decrease in the range of -5% to -10% sequentially. The company estimates gross margin in the range of 64.0-65%, tax rate to be approximately 13% and earnings per share in the range of 44 -52 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Deviceswill beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 48 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider other stocks with a positive earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 such as: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +4.50% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

ecently  (  ) entered into an agreement to acquire Aerospace Dynamic International (ADI) from the Marvin Group in an all-cash deal. The acquisition is valued at $625 million and is expected to close by the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory requirements.Aerospace Dynamics International is known as the leading supplier of large complex machined parts and assemblies to Aerospace and Defense industries. ADI has the most advanced titanium machining capabilities and is a trusted supplier of major structural components on practically every commercial and military aircraft program for global OEMs along with tier one suppliers.Precision Castparts will include the ADI business in its Airframe Products segment as the latter's business is expected to improve the value proposition for the airframe business by expanding its aerostructures product offering and its role on the next-generation aircraft. The Permaswage and Airdome acquisitions had earlier strengthened Precision's permanent fittings and separable fittings business. This latest acquisition will cause further upward momentum. The ADI acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings immediately.Apart from vertical integration, the acquisition of Permaswage also provide Precision with geographic and product synergies. ADI acquisition also supports Precision Castparts growing presence in Southern California, as it has a facility in Valencia, CA. ADI's core competence lies in large complex components, hard metal machining and critical assemblies. It has strong positions across high-growth commercial platforms, including a significant presence on the Airbus A350.Therefore, Precision is very optimistic about its acquisition of ADI, which it has been considering for a while, as it already enjoys a favorable position in the current and next-generation commercial aircraft platforms. Moreover, this acquisition comes at an opportune time when aerospace and aircraft manufacturers worldwide are witnessing an increase in orders due to growing commercial traffic.Leading aerospace companies such as Precision Castparts and TransDigm Group (TDG) have been pursuing strategic acquisitions to attain synergies and cost efficiencies. Acquisitions pursued by both these companies in the recent past have been accretive to earnings.Precision Casptarts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

n Jan 8, 2014, Zacks  downgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The downgrade can be attributed to weak guidance and negative estimate revisions over the last 60 days.Analog Devices' fourth-quarter revenues were down 2.4% year over year and at the lower end of management's guidance of $675 million to $700.0 million. Also, total end customer orders were down sequentially, with the book-to-bill ratio reporting below one.The company provided a weak first-quarter 2014 outlook, with revenues expected to decrease in the range of -5% to -10% sequentially. Management expects gross margin to be in the range of 64.0%-65% and earnings per share in the range of 44 cents-52 cents for the upcoming quarter.Additionally, the softening demand for semiconductors at the end of 2013, with some larger chip companies expecting sales to decrease sequentially in the upcoming quarter, creates near-term uncertainty. Last month, chipmaker, Texas Instruments, narrowed its sales guidance, while Semtech Corporation expects sales to dip in the upcoming quarter. We believe these uncertainties will remain an overhang on Analog Devices in the near term.Estimate revision trend reflects bearish sentiment toward Analog Devices' earnings for the ongoing as well as next year.Over the last 60 days, 18 of the 20 estimates for 2014 have been revised downward, dragging down the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share by 13% to $2.26 per share.

nalog Devices Inc. (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2013 earnings of 62 cents per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. The earnings beat was driven by strong revenue growth in the automotive segment coupled with better gross margins.Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.Analog Devices generated revenues of $678.1 million, up 0.6% sequentially but down 2.4% year over year. The revenues were at the lower end of management's guidance of $675 million to $700.0 million. The sequential increase was driven by the strength in the automotive segment.Total end customer orders, which include both original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and distribution, were down sequentially. Also, the book-to-bill ratio was below one.The  market generated 46% of Analog Devices' total revenue (flat sequentially but up 2.0% year over year). This is a diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments. The improved performance in the automation and process control business was offset by lower revenues from the instrumentation business, especially in smartphones, tablets and other devices with wireless connectivity. However, the defense and aerospace businesses recovered in the fourth quarter, growing by more than 10%. generated 21% of total revenue, flat sequentially but down 2% year over year. The modest sequential growth in the wireless infrastructure sub-segment driven by deployments in North America and Asia was partially offset by inventory reductions at some base-station customers, resulting in no sequential growwth.Encouraged by the intention of the operators in China and the U.S. to increase their 4G LTE deployments in 2014, management expects growth to resume in the next year.The  segment generated around 19% of Analog Devices' fourth-quarter revenues, up 9.0% sequentially and 19.0% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by strength across new infotainment platforms, safety and powertrain applications. Additionally, the ramp up of next generation safety platforms including advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) radar saw higher adoption rates in the last quarter. In powertrain, stop-start battery monitoring technology gained traction in other higher-volume vehicles, increasing the the company's potential growth.Management continues to believe that growth in worldwide luxury vehicle will lead to solid automotive revenues in the near term. The growing electronic content in vehicles will remain a positive, with demand for products like driver assistance and powertrain efficiency systems remaining strong.The  segment, which Analog Devices clubbed with the computing and handset businesses, was down 6.0% sequentially and 31.0% year over year. It accounted for 14.0% of total fourth quarter revenues.On a sequential basis, revenues increased across all product lines, except in amplifiers and power management & reference products. However, on a year-over-year basis, the decline in revenues was broad-based across product lines.Analog signal processing products (91% of total revenue) were up 1.0% sequentially but down 3.0% year over year. Converters were up 2.0% sequentially but flat year over year. Amplifier revenues declined 1.0% sequentially but increased 1.0% year over year. Other analog products were flat sequentially but down 18.0% from the year-ago quarter.Power management and reference products contributed roughly 7% of revenues, down 3% both sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter. These products are generally sold in the consumer/computing markets. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.Digital Signal Processing (DSPs) (9% of total revenues) was up 1.0% sequentially and 6.0% from the year-ago level.Reported gross margin for the quarter was 65.6%, up 110 basis points (bps) sequentially and 180 bps year over year. The primary reason for the increase in gross margin was attributable to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs.Analog reported operating expenses of $245.0 million, up 7.5% from $228.0 million incurred in the year-ago quarter. Both research & development and selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarter. The net result was a GAAP operating margin of 29.5%, down 150 bps from the year-ago quarter of 31.0%.On a GAAP basis, Analog Devices recorded a net profit of $201.6 million or 64 cents per share compared with $179.2 million or 58 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.The company generated adjusted net profit of $196.7 million compared with $178.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma earnings came in at 62 cents per share compared with 58 cents in the year-ago quarter.AnalogDevices exited the fourth quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $4.68 billion, up from $4.45 billion in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $325.1 million, down from $345.4 million in the prior quarter.Cash generated from operations was around $282.2 million. Analog Devices spent $48.6 million on capex, $42.8 million on share repurchases and $105.9 million on cash dividends.During the quarter, the company declared a cash dividend of 34 cents per share to be paid on Dec 17, 2013, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 6, 2013.Management expects first-quarter 2014 revenues to decrease in the range of -5% to -10% sequentially. The company estimates gross margin in the range of 64.0%-65%, operating expenses to decrease approximately within $3 million to $226 million, tax rate to be approximately 13% and earnings per share in the range of 44 cents-52 cents.Analog Devices has a significant percentage of its revenues coming from the industrial and communication markets, both of which are expected to see strong demand in 2014. The increased 3G and 4G deployments in China and the U.S will revive growth in these markets, going forward.However, in the near term, management expects certain customer shutdowns and inventory reductions due to the upcoming holiday season. Given these negatives, it is not surprising that the revenue guidance was down sequentially. Also, with continued uncertainty in key markets, the shares may remain range-bound in the near term.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Other stocks that are performing well at current levels include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices Beats on Q4 Earnings - Analyst Blog@2013-11-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-beats-on-q4-earnings-analyst-blog-2013-11-27

 (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter 2013 results on Nov 26. Last quarter, it posted a 5.6% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog's fiscal third-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by strong revenue growth coupled with better gross margins and solid expense management. Additionally, revenues were up sequentially driven by strength in communications and industrial segments. Analog reported operating margin of 39.0%, which was down 20 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Analog provided a modest outlook for the fourth quarter, with revenues expected in the range of $675 million to $700 million, up 2.0% sequentially. The company estimates gross margin to be 65.0%, operating expenses to increase by approximately 1%, tax rate in the range of 14%-15% and earnings per share within 55 cents-61 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Analog Devices will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 58 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider other stocks with a positive earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 such as: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ), with Earnings ESP of +25.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The improvement came from the wireless infrastructure sub-segment as China launched the last phase of its 3G TDS CDMA network build out which led carriers in the U.S. to move toward densification of the 4G LTE networks. Analog Devices has offerings for both traditional and 4G networks and therefore stands to gain from demand ramp. Operators in China and the U.S. have declared their intent to increase 4G LTE deployments in 2014. Additionally, it has higher content in the 4G segment, which, along with its position at leading OEMs, should remain a positive factor influencing revenue growth.The  segment generated around 18% of Analog Devices' third quarter revenues, down 2.0% sequentially but up 5.0% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company did not perform well in the last quarter, management believes that growth in worldwide luxury vehicle will lead to solid automotive revenues in the near term.

The primary reason for the sequential increase in gross margin was attributable to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs.Analog reported operating expenses of $226.7 million, down 3.7% from $235.4 million incurred in the year-ago quarter. Research and development expense increased as a percentage of sales, while selling, general and administrative costs decreased from the year-ago quarter.

The company estimates gross margin to be 65.0%, operating expenses to increase by approximately 1%, tax rate in the range of 14%-15% and earnings per share of 55 cents-61 cents.Analog Devices has a significant percentage of its revenues coming from the industrial and Communication markets, both of which are expected to see strong demand in the near term due to an improved demand environment. The increased 3G and 4G deployments in most regions and healthy order rates expected in the industrial market are quite encouraging.Given these positives, it is not surprising that the revenue guidance was up sequentially. However, with continued uncertainty in key markets, the shares may remain range bound in the near term.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 (  ) recently selected a PMG solution to automate the processes associated with global service fulfillment. PMG's Service Catalogue Suite (SCS) would be adopted by ADI for streamlining service requests and delivery processes.PMG has been providing solutions to improve business processes since 1996. It has in fact developed the market leading IT Infrastructure Library compliant Enterprise Service Catalog software.Analog Devices, Inc. is one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal processing applications. Applications for its products include communications, cellular telephones, computers and computer peripherals, consumer electronics, automotive electronics, factory automation, process control and military and space systems.From 2012 onward, the Information Services segment of ADI started shifting focus toward value added services, which required the streamlining of procedures related to ordering of items like laptops and software upgrades. Its older system delayed approvals and made it difficult to track requests. The (easy-to-use) PMG SCS Suite with its library of applications and advanced workflow engine is therefore expected to improve the level of performance and automate delivery.Analog Devices Inc. reported third quarter 2013 earnings of 57 cents per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. The increase was driven by strong revenue growth coupled with better gross margins and solid expense management.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).

nalog Devices, Inc  (  ) is set to report third-quarter 2013 results on Aug 20. Last quarter, it posted a -3.85% surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog's second-quarter earnings were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to higher-than-expected operating expenses. However, revenues were up sequentially driven by the strength in industrial and automotive segments. Analog reported operating margin of 29.0%, which was down 250 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Analog provided a tepid outlook for the third quarter, with revenues expected in the range of $655 million to $685 million, lower than analysts' expectations of $688 million. The company estimates gross margin to be 64.5%, operating expenses of around $226 million, a tax rate of 16.5% and earnings per share of 51 cents-56 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter stands at 54 cents while that for fiscal 2013 stands at $2.10.Analog Devices has beaten estimates once in the last four quarters, missed once, while reporting in-line results in the other two. There were no estimate revisions for both the third quarter and fiscal 2013 over the past 30 days. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both periods have remained unchanged. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Other stocks that have both a positive earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 are: (  ), Earnings ESP of +2.50% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Strong Buy) (  ), Earnings ESP of +2.30% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) (  ), Earnings ESP of +1.18% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Will Analog Devices, Inc.

stimates have been falling for  (  ) after the company reported soft second quarter results and provided weak third quarter guidance. It is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.Despite the negative earnings momentum, shares of Silicon Labs still trade at a premium valuation. Investors may want to wait for earnings momentum to turn around before establishing a long position.Silicon Labs develops analog-intensive, mixed-signal integrated circuits used in a wide range of applications such as set-top boxes, televisions, and cell phones. The company was founded in 1996 and has a market cap of $1.7 billion.Silicon Labs reported its second quarter results on July 25. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 33 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Revenues declined 3% from the previous quarter to $141.5 million, which was also below the consensus at $143.0 million. This decrease was driven by steep declines in some of the company's legacy products.Following the soft Q2 results, management guided Q3 EPS significantly below the consensus at the time. This prompted analysts to revise their estimates significantly lower for both 2013 and 2014, sending the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 is now $1.46, down from $1.73 just 30 days ago. The 2014 consensus is currently $1.65, down from $1.94 over the same period.You can see the big drop in consensus estimates in the following chart:Shares of Silicon Labs are down more than -12% since the Q2 earnings release. Despite this, the stock doesn't look like a value here. Shares currently trade around 25x 12-month forward earnings, which is a premium to the industry median 16x. Its price to cash flow ratio of 19 is also above the industry median of 14x.With falling earnings estimates and premium valuation, investors should consider avoiding this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock until its earnings momentum turns around.Investors still interested in the 'Semiconductor - Analog & Mixed' industry may want to take a look at  (  ), which carries a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) and trades at 19x forward earnings, or  (  ), which has a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) and trades at 20x.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Bear of the Day: Silicon Labs (SLAB) - Bear of the Day@2013-08-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-day-silicon-labs-slab-bear-day-2013-08-09
"ast week,  (  ) investors rejoiced in the hope that billionaire investor Icahn's demands would be met while  (  ) investors expressed concern that the company was losing market share.Activist investor Carl Icahn posted on Twitter that he had put a billion dollars into Apple stock and was pushing the company to authorize an additional $150 billion for share repurchases. Icahn's view is that Apple is significantly undervalued and would trade higher if the repurchase was sanctioned. Apple shares rose after the announcement and continued to rise through the rest of the week.It is true that Apple is trading at a much lower multiple than companies like  (  ) and  (  ), but valuation is usually the way the market views a company. In Apple's case, it appears that the stock is moving from the growth to the value category, or at least that's the way the market views it. Investor delight at the chances of a higher payout further supports this view.It's possible that Apple will introduce some great products that push up its growth rates. But until that happens, investors are unwilling to pay a higher price betting on its growth. They are however eyeing its cash hoard and looking for a share.Cisco reported a good quarter but provided a disappointing guidance. Management commentary was not unexpected: it continues to do reasonably well in North America despite uneven economic recovery, its performance in Europe is on track with Southern concerns remaining and its performance in Asia is marred by weakness in China (as expected). But shares swooned nonetheless.So what gives? Basically, management announced a massive headcount reduction (4,000 employees, or 5% of the workforce) with no corresponding increase in earnings projections. Management didn't quite explain the delta other than an assurance that resources were being allocated to reposition the company in target areas (likely cloud computing, mobility, security, video, and software and services).Cisco does have quite a bit on its plate at the moment with weak economies, constrained IT budgets, and the continued threat of software defined networking (SDN) eating into its core routing and switching business. Its Cisco ONE initiative is encouraging, but remains a fledgling effort as of now.So while Cisco's transformation into a software and service-focused company will not bear fruit for a while yet, it appears that costs will be slashed as necessary in an effort to maintain earnings growth. (  ) lawyer David Howard had a field day pulling down Google, which blocked Microsoft's YouTube app for the Windows phone (again). The earlier app that Microsoft produced didn't allow ads, enabled video download and the viewing of reserved videos. Google's current objections boil down to the HTML 5 coding language, which was part of the terms and conditions. Since neither iPhones nor any of the Android phones are required to use HTML 5, Microsoft published the new app as is, which Google subsequently blocked.The important thing to note here is that all the other phones use Google search as the default, while Microsoft naturally uses Bing. Microsoft is also asking for Google's metasearch data so it can serve the YouTube ads more effectively.One can understand why Google would be hesitant to share such information with its fiercest competitor and only remaining search rival, but it's unlikely that it can prove its innocence in a court of law. That's because this latest move is not helping consumers and not promoting competition, the two things most important to antitrust regulators.

arnings Release Date: 08/20/2013Time: After-hoursAvg. Extended-Hours Dollar Volume: $168,301,452Earnings Sensitivity (up or down): 1.8%Analog Devices, Inc. (  ) is due to issue its quarterly earnings report after the close today. Given its history, traders can expect very active trading in the upcoming After-hours session immediately following the company's release of its quarterly earnings. An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in ADI following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.Analysts at MidnightTrader have tracked how ADI's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session. The result of that study is below.Over the last year, when shares of ADI rose in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, there is limited evidence to suggest a follow-through in the same direction the next day.Over that same historical period, when shares of ADI dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 75% of the time over the last 4 quarters the stock dropped further, adding to the extended-hours losses by an average of 0.40% by the following regular session close.Our analysis of over a decade of company specific earnings related news and price data on over 5,000 US companies demonstrates that earnings event related trading opportunities can exist for those trading in the after-hours and premarket sessions. Certain stocks demonstrate a historical tendency to either underprice or overreact to earnings news in the extended-hours (the time when companies typically release earnings) relative to the following regular session close.This report was created using historical data and analysis provided by the Midnight Trader Pro service at MidnightTrader.com.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Trade the Earnings: Analog Devices, Inc.@2013-08-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-earnings-analog-devices-inc-2013-08-20
 's (  ) second quarter 2013 loss of 7 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents loss per share.Revenues of $62.7 million were up 19.2% sequentially and 14.4% from the year-ago quarter.System on chip (SoC), DRAM and Flash customers generated 44%, 43% and 13% of second-quarter revenues, respectively.The  business generated revenues of $27.5 million, up 4.2% sequentially. FormFactor is reaping the benefits of its MicroProbe acquisition, by virtue of which it became the largest supplier of probe cards to the fast growing SoC probe card market. Overall strength in this market is currently being driven by the move from PC applications toward mobile application processors where probe card solutions are more complex and require higher parallelism.The  business rose 21.4% sequentially to $26.7 million. The strength in DRAM probe cards resulted from stronger mobile demand and higher pricing of DRAM devices from fourth quarter 2012 onwards. FormFactor is witnessing a rise in demand for DRAM consumption in smartphones compared to PCs.We believe that the DRAM market may recover as the industry is undergoing a structural shift from PC centered computing to mobile and cloud centered computing.The  business was up 102.4% sequentially to $8.5 million. NOR revenues were $3.6 million while NAND accounted for the balance. Revenues increased at more or less the same rate in both product lines.GAAP gross margin increased 890 basis points (bps) sequentially but dropped 334 bps year over year to 26.2%. Higher revenues and a favorable product mix contributed to the sequential expansion in gross margins.Total operating expenses of $24.9 million were down 15.8% sequentially but up 9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The operating margin was (13.6%), up 2541 bps sequentially but down 172 bps from the year-ago quarter. Research and development (R&D) expenses as a percentage of sales declined both sequentially and year over year. While selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense declined sequentially, it increased from last year.Pro forma net loss was $3.4 million or 5.4% of sales, compared to a loss of $9.9 million or 18.8% in the previous quarter and a loss of $4.0 million or 7.3% in the year-ago quarter.Including restructuring charges and impairment of long-lived assets on a tax-adjusted basis, GAAP net loss per share came to 16 cents in the last quarter compared to 37 cents in the prior quarter and 8 cents in the year-ago quarter.Inventories of $26.1 million were up 5.8% in the second quarter of 2013. The company exited the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $154.5 million versus $153.6 million in the prior quarter. FormFactor has no debt. Long-term liabilities totaled $10.3 million at quarter end.Cash generated from operations was $1.0 million in the second quarter compared with ($11.1) million in the prior quarter.For the third quarter, FormFactor expects revenues in the range of $65.0−$69.0 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 32%-35%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $21.0-$22.0 million. Cash generation in the quarter is expected to be $2.0 million.FormFactor is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of automated wafer probe cards used in the semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) manufacturing process. It is well-positioned in the semiconductor industry and has further solidified its position with the addition of MicroProbe's SoC probe card segment. The acquisition will make FormFactor a bigger player in the SoC probe card market.However, the lingering macroeconomic weakness and softness in the PC market that affected FormFactor's results in the quarter are expected to continue in the next.

eading semiconductor manufacturer  (  ) reported phenomenal first quarter fiscal 2014 results with solid revenues, driven by broad-based growth across all product lines. The company reported GAAP net income of $78.6 million or 37 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 compared with $78.7 million or 39 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted net income for the reported quarter was a record high of $120.4 million or 57 cents per share, up 24.3% from $96.9 million or 48 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-increase in non-GAAP earnings is primarily attributable to solid top-line growth. The quarterly adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Net revenue for the reported quarter came in at $462.8 million in first quarter fiscal 2014, up 31.4% year over year, aided by a healthy microcontroller business. Microchip exceeded the higher end of its revised revenue guidance provided in June. The quarterly revenues were also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $455 million.In terms of product mix, revenues from microcontroller products accounted for 64.9% of the total revenue in the quarter, while analog revenues, memory chip and licensing business represented 22.3%, 7.3% and 4.9% of total revenues, respectively. By geographical regions, bulk of the revenues came in from Asia ($274.6 million), followed by Europe ($101.2 million) and the Americas ($86.9 million).Net sales of microcontroller products recorded an all-time high of $300.3 million, up 24.8% year over year, driven by robust sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. While 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 71.7% year over year, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up a staggering 362% in the reported quarter compared with the year-ago quarter, driven by new design wins and applications.Analog revenues increased 119% year over year to achieve record sales of $103.2 million in the reported quarter. With annual sales of about $413 million, the Analog business has become one of the largest analog franchises in the industry. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products. Revenues from memory business totaled $34.0 million, while licensing revenues were $22.5 million in first quarter fiscal 2014. Gross margin (GAAP) for the reported quarter was 57.6%, while operating income was $98.4 million.With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip was able to reduce its inventory during the quarter to $256.1 million or 119 days. Inventory at distributors was at 32 days with a healthy book-to-bill ratio. The company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from 35.35 cents to 35.40 cents per share, representing the 38th dividend increase since its inception.Cash and investments at quarter-end were $1.9 billion, with $610 million debt under its revolving line of credit. During the reported quarter, Microchip executed a new five-year $2-billion worth revolving credit facility, replacing its existing $750 million credit facility. Free cash flow at quarter-end was $138.9 million prior to the dividend payment.Concurrent with the first quarter earnings release, management provided guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Management expects net sales between $472.0 million and $490.6 million, while GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 57.6% to 58.2%. GAAP net income is anticipated to be in the range of $86.7 million to $95.5 million, with earnings per share of 40 to 44 cents.Microchip expects to increase cash and investments by approximately $110 million to $130 million in the second quarter prior to dividend payment. The company expects to incur $27 million in capital expenditure in the next quarter, bringing its tally to about $90 million for fiscal 2014.With better-than-expected bookings and increasing requests driven by strong demand and robust product designs, Microchip is expected to continue its bull run in the coming quarters. We also remain encouraged by the strong results of the company and its bullish guidance.Microchip presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Electric car maker  (  ) is no stranger to fanfare.The company and its high-flying shares got a little bit more of that on Monday evening when NASDAQ OMX Global Indexes announced the stock will replace  (  ) as a member of the  (INDEXNASDAQ:NDX).Tesla will join the NASDAQ-100 and the  (INDEXNASDAQ:NDXE) on July 15, thus making the stock eligible for inclusion in  such as the  (  ) and the  (  ).As a story stock, Tesla is also a controversial stock. Critics say the valuation is stretched. Supporters say the company is revolutionizing the auto industry. No matter what one's feeling are about Elon Musk's company, chances are those feelings are strong. An  despite the fact that the shares have tripled in the past 90 days says as much.Investors are even arguing whether or not the move to the NASDAQ-100 is already priced into shares of Tesla. Maybe it is, assuming the fund managers that benchmark to that index have already bought exactly the amount of Tesla stock they need to be inline with index parameters.Those looking for clues regarding the impact a jump to the NASDAQ-100 and QQQ can have on a stock just need to go back to December when 10 additions and subtractions to the index, and subsequently the ETF, were made.The following 10 stocks became members of the NASDAQ-100 on December 24, 2012:  (  ),  (CTRX),  (DISCA),  (EQIX),  (LBTYA),  (LMCA),  (REGN),  (SBAC),  (VRSK), and  (WDC).Over the month that followed, all of those stocks rose. Regeneron was the worst performer with a gain of 0.6%; Western Digital was the best performer, gaining 14.3%. The NASDAQ-100 is re-ranked each year in December, timed to coincide with the quadruple witch expiration Friday of the quarter,  .None of those stocks are prominent members of QQQ. Combined, the 10 represent less than 3.8% of the ETF's weight with Regeneron receiving the largest weight at 0.54 percent. Said another way,  (CSCO) alone accounts for almost 3.9% of QQQ.Based on a current market cap of $14.1 billion, if Tesla was a QQQ holding today, it would have slightly less of an impact on the ETF than Analog Devices. That stocks has a weight of 0.41% in the ETF,  .It is safe to say that Tesla's inclusion in a particular index is not going to do anything about the stock's valuations or motivate any to buy or not buy its cars. And although the stock has been on fire, Tesla bulls may want to see the stock booted from the index. Why? Because  (NFLX) almost doubled in the first quarter of this year after being removed from the NASDAQ-100 last December. The stock has since rejoined the index.  (GMCR) was removed with Netflix and has not rejoined the NASDAQ-100. That stock is up 67% this year.Twitter: The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@What to Expect From Tesla Shares After Joining NASDAQ-100@2013-07-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-expect-tesla-shares-after-joining-nasdaq-100-2013-07-11

 (  ) reported second quarter 2013 earnings of 50 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents. Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.Analog Devices generated revenues of $659.3 million, up 6.0% sequentially but down 2.3% year over year. The sequential growth was within management's guidance of 4-8% increase and was driven by the strength in industrial and automotive segments.In the last quarter, total end customer orders, which include both OEM and distribution, was up sequentially. Also, the book-to-bill ratio was slightly above unity.Geographically, orders improved across all regions, with particular strengths in North America and Europe.The  market generated 47% of Analog Devices' total revenue (up 11.0% sequentially but down 4.0% year over year). This is a diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.Management expects the industrial end market to register strong growth in the third quarter as order rates have been improving and inventory levels remain low.The  segment generated around 19% of Analog Devices' second quarter revenues, up 14.0% sequentially and 3.0% from the year-ago quarter. Strong vehicles demand in North America and China and growth in worldwide luxury vehicle led to solid automotive revenues in the last quarter. The growing electronic content in vehicles remained a positive, with demand for products like driver assistance and powertrain efficiency systems remaining strong. generated 19% of total revenue, down 2.0% both sequentially as well as year over year. The decline was broad based, with the largest sequential decrease coming from the wireless infrastructure sub-segment. Though the market performed poorly in the last quarter, management expects the business to improve as leading phone makers, such as Samsung and  (  ), focus more on 4G and LTE. Analog Devices has offerings for both traditional and 4G networks and therefore stands to gain from demand ramp. Additionally, it has higher content in the 4G segment, which along with its position at leading OEMs should remain a positive factor influencing revenue growth.The  segment, which Analog clubbed with the computing and handset businesses, was down 6.0% sequentially and 5% year over year. It accounted for 15% of total second quarter revenues.On a sequential basis, revenues increased across all product lines, except in the other analog products. On the contrary, revenues decreased across all product lines on a year-over-year basis, except in converters.Analog signal processing products (85% of total revenue) were up 5.0% sequentially but down 2.0% year over year. Converters were up 9.0% sequentially and 1.0% year over year. Amplifier revenues increased 4.0% sequentially and declined 7.0% year over year. Other analog products were down 4.0% sequentially but up 2.0% from year-ago quarters.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenues, up 11.0% sequentially but down 5.0% from the year-ago quarter. These products are generally sold in the consumer/computing markets. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.Digital Signal Processing (DSPs) (9% of total revenue) was up 11.0% sequentially but down 6.0% from the year-ago level.Reported gross margin for the quarter was 64.0%, up 130 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 120 bps year over year. The primary reason for the sequential increase in gross margin was attributable to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs.Analog reported operating expenses of $230.8 million, up 1.5% from $227.5 million incurred in the year-ago quarter. Research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, were both up as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarters. The net result was a GAAP operating margin of 29.0% compared with 31.5% in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, Analog recorded a net profit of $164.5 million or 52 cents per share compared with $162.9 million or 53 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Analog generated adjusted net profit of $156.7 million compared with $162.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma earnings per share came in at 50 cents compared with 53 cents in the last quarter.Analog exited the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $4.17 billion, up from $3.99 billion in the prior quarter. Trade receivables were $333.9 million, up from $329.6 million in the prior quarter.Cash generated from operations was around $252.2 million. Analog Devices spent $26.2 million on capex, $104.4 million on cash dividends and $4.5 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.During the quarter, the company announced that its board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 34 cents per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on Jun 11, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2013.Management expects third quarter revenues to be in the range of $655 to $685 million, up 1.6% sequentially but lower than analyst expectations of $688 million. The company estimates gross margin to be 64.5%, operating expenses of around $226 million, a tax rate of 16.5% and earnings per share of 51-56 cents.Analog Devices has a significant percentage of its revenues coming from the industrial and automotive markets, both of which are expected to see strong demand in the near term due to an improved demand environment and healthy order rates expected in the industrial market.Given these positives, it is not surprising that the revenue guidance was up sequentially but below analyst expectations. With continued uncertainty in key markets, the shares may remain range bound in the near term.Currently, Analog has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks that have been performing well and are worth a look include  (  ) and  (  ), both with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog's 2Q Earnings Miss Estimate - Analyst Blog@2013-05-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analogs-2q-earnings-miss-estimate-analyst-blog-2013-05-22
 (  ) is set to report third quarter 2013 results on May 21. Last quarter, its results were in line with our expectations. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices' second-quarter earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. Revenues were down 10.0% sequentially and at the lower end of the management guidance due to weak sales across a wide range of communications infrastructure applications, automotive and industrial segments. Margin expansion was limited due to the change in sales mix, which favored lower-margin products.Analog Devices provided a modest outlook for the third quarter, with revenues forecast to increase 4-8% sequentially. ADI expects earnings per share in the range of 49-55 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents at the midpoint.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter stands at 52 cents while that for fiscal 2013 stands at $2.18.Analog Devices has beaten estimates twice in the last four quarters while meeting estimates in the other two. There were no estimate revisions for both the third quarter and fiscal 2013 over the past 30 days. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both periods has remained unchanged.The chances of a big surprise are unlikely given the lack of catalysts during the quarter. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Other stocks that have both a positive earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 are: (  ), Earnings ESP of +0.98% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ), Earnings ESP of +3.03% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices Preview: Will It Miss? - Analyst Blog@2013-05-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-preview%3A-will-it-miss-analyst-blog-2013-05-20
 , or TI) reported first-quarter earnings that were down sequentially but up year over year. More importantly, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents by 4 cents or 14.3%. Investors were upbeat about TI's results, so shares remained buoyant during the day and appreciated an additional 1.7% in extended trading.TI reported revenue of $2.89 billion, which was down 3.2% sequentially and 7.6% year over year (slightly better than the mid-point of the recently narrowed guidance range of $2.80 billion to $2.91 billion).With lead times remaining very low (they dropped to 6 weeks going into the second half of 2012), visibility remains low. Additionally, inventories remain lean at all customers and particularly at distributors, which further reduced inventories during the quarter.TI changed the segment reporting structure in the last quarter, with the wireless segment being dissolved and relevant portions being included in the remaining segments.The  business fell 1.3% sequentially and 2.3% year over year. TI attributed the year-over-year decline primarily to SVA, which continues to shift to a consignment model. HVAL and HPA also declined and were offset by increase in the power management product line. HVAL and power management product lines negatively impacted the sequential performance.The  segment, which now includes the processor, microcontroller and connectivity product lines grew 2.7% sequentially and 3.9% from last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by microcontrollers and connectivity products supported by flattish processor sales. Microcontrollers also increased on a sequential basis.The  segment, which now includes DLPs, custom ASICs, calculators, royalties and some legacy wireless products was down 11.5% sequentially and 24.5% year over year. All except DLP products and royalties declined from the year-ago quarter. Insurance proceeds received in the year-ago quarter also made comps difficult.The sequential decline was driven by legacy wireless, custom ASIC and royalties as offset by increase in calculator revenue and consistent DLP revenue. The legacy wireless products target the volatile smartphone and tablet markets and are being phased out by TI. Therefore they were responsible for much of the decline in segment revenue from both the previous and year-ago quarters.Net product orders were $2.96 billion in the last quarter, up 8.8% sequentially and down 8.6% year over year. We estimate that backlog increased sequentially, with turns sales increasing by around 9%. TI currently generates around 45% of its revenue from the consignment model, which is having a positive impact on turns sales.TI's gross margin of 47.6% was down 88 bps sequentially and 210 bps from the year-ago quarter. The gross margin was the net result of weak revenue and low utilization rates. In addition, year-over-year comps were difficult because of insurance proceeds received in that quarter. The gross margin remains well below the long-term target of 55%.Operating expenses of $878 million were higher than the previous quarter's $855 million. The operating margin was 17.2%, down 261 bps sequentially and 142 bps from the year-ago quarter. All expenses increased sequentially as a perentage of sales. However, the decline from the year-ago quarter was mainly because of the lower gross margin, as the decline in R&D more than offset the increase in SG&A.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated operating margins of 18.2% (down 690 bps sequentially), 1.2% (down 77 bps) and 13.0% (up more than 51 percentage points), respectively.The pro forma net income was $398 million, or a 13.8% net income margin compared to $417 million, or 14.0% in the previous quarter and $400 million, or 12.8% in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 35 cents compared to 37 cents in the previous quarter and 34 cents in the Mar quarter of last year. The pro forma calculations for the last quarter exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related charges, as well as discrete tax items.On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit of $362 million, or 32 cents a share compared to a net profit of $264 million, or 23 cents per share in the previous quarter and a net profit of $265 million (23 cents per share) in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories dropped 3.2% to $1.70 billion, which resulted in inventory turns of 3.6X, up slightly from 3.5X in the previous quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went up from 38 to around 42. TI generated $360 million in cash from operations, spending $84 million on capex, $679 million on share repurchases and $232 million on cash dividends.At quarter-end, TI had $4.2 billion in long-term debt and $1.5 billion in short-term debt. During the quarter, the net debt position moved up slightly. It also had underfunded retirement plans of $196 million.TI provided guidance for the second quarter and provided some limited estimates for fiscal year 2013.Accordingly, TI expects first quarter revenue to come in between $2.93 billion and $3.17 billion (down 5.7% sequentially at the mid-point), which is more or less in line with the consensus estimate of $3.04 billion. Legacy wireless products are expected to decline by around $60 million, or 30% sequentially. The rest of the business is expected to be up 8.5% (in line with normal seasonality.The EPS for the quarter is expected to be 37 to 45 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.For 2013, TI expects R&D expenses of 1.5 billion, capex of 0.5 billion, depreciation of $0.9 billion and an annual effective tax rate of 22%.Texas Instruments is prudently investing its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets, while reducing its exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets.The last few years have also seen other analog companies, such as  (  ) and  (  ) increasing focus on these areas. These markets have better secular drivers (energy efficiency in industrial and increasing electronic content in automotive). They also generate higher margins. Therefore, this strategy along with higher utilization rates may enable the company to move closer to its long-term margin targets.We therefore remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm capacity that should in combination drive earnings in the longer term.However, while improved growth prospects are driving results for analog peers such as  (  ) and Maxim, TI is going through a transition where its declining wireless revenue and extra capacity are likely to restrict earnings growth. TI shares therefore carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while most of its peers have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@TI Beats Estimates, Shares Rise - Analyst Blog@2013-04-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ti-beats-estimates-shares-rise-analyst-blog-2013-04-23
 (  ) reported third-quarter 2013 earnings that were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The weaker-than-expected revenue guidance indicates limited growth prospects in several important markets, such as communications infrastructure and computing.Linear reported revenue of $314.5 million, up 3.0% sequentially and up 0.7% year over year, roughly in line with management's guidance range of a 1-4% sequential increase. Management stated that order rates improved early on in the quarter and there was a steady flow through the quarter, accounting for the improved revenues and orders in the quarter.Japan and the Asia/Pacific proved to be the weaker geographies for Linear. Japan was impacted by deflation from a government-instituted stimulus, China was impacted by Chinese New Year-related softness and the Asia/Pacific overall saw seasonally softer consumer sales. Europe on the other hand was particularly strong due to seasonal strength in the industrial and automotive end markets.The revenue distribution by geography was as follows: the Asia/Pacific region (ex-Japan) 37%, down 2.3% sequentially, the U.S. with 29% (up 3.0%), Europe 20% (up 21.2%) and Japan 14% (down 3.8%).The mix of orders was favorable for Linear. The company saw strength in the industrial and automotive areas, which are management focal points, while consumer and computing softened slightlyThe  market remains the largest contributor with a 43% share. Orders were up high single-digits on a sequential basis. The industrial business remains broad-based across geographies and end markets and Linear is capitalizing on the growing demand for energy efficiency in this market. , the other focus area accounted for 18% of quarterly orders. The strong double-digit increase from the Dec quarter was mostly because of Japan and Europe, which were supported by modest growth in the U.S. and a flattish Asia/Pacific. Similar to other semiconductor providers, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), Linear's performance in this end market stems from the growing electronic content in vehicles.However,  remained the second largest market with 20% of total orders. Linear stated that the low-single-digit increase was attributable to slight increases at most large telecom infrastructure and networking customers. Cell phones remained well below 1% of total bookings, so did not affect segment performance much. The number of smartphones and tablets in the market today (and those ready to hit the market this year) indicate wireless infrastructure spending will not go away.Over the last few years, Linear has reduced its exposure to the  segment and contained exposure to the  segment because of the typically low margins and significant seasonal fluctuations. Over the next few years, mobile electronic computing goods with a consumer flavor are likely to grow faster than any other segment. Therefore, Linear will lose out on this opportunity. accounted for 6% of total orders, impacted by U.S. government budget constraints. This resulted in declines from both the previous and year-ago quarters.Orders showed good linearity and were up in both the U.S. and internationally (although Japan declined). As a result, both orders and backlog increased in the last quarter and the book-to-bill was also positive.The gross margin for the quarter was 74.8%, up 41 bps sequentially and down 34 bps from the comparable quarter of the prior year. The ASP grew dropped a penny to $1.84 in the last quarter, but was higher than the $1.81 in the year-ago quarter. Unit growth was positive on a sequential basis and slightly negative compared to the year-ago quarter.While Linear's gross margins remain very attractive, the company is now saddled with some excess capacity and employees that management does not want to cut. Therefore, it is expected that margins will get back up as and when sales and therefore utilization rates pick up.Operating expenses of $97.0 million were up 2.8% from the previous quarter's $94.4 million. The operating margin of 44.0% expanded 50 bps sequentially because the slight decline in R&D offset the slight increase in SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales).The net income for the quarter was $116.3 million or 37.0% of sales, compared to $94.1 million or 30.8% in the previous quarter and $103.5 million or 33.1% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Earnings including a couple of cents of debt discount amortization were 46 cents, up from 38 cents in the previous quarter and 42 cents in the Dec quarter of 2011.Inventories increased 1.6% sequentially, with inventory turns dropping staying relatively flat at 3.7X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) dropped from 43 to 41. The company ended with cash and short-term investments of $1.45 billion, up $155.1 million during the quarter.Management provided limited guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Accordingly, revenue is expected to increase 1-4%, much better than normal seasonality. The operating income is expected to grow in absolute dollars but remain consistent as a percentage of sales. The effective tax rate will be 25%. Capex is expected to $15-20 million for fiscal 2013.Linear's third-quarter earnings were helped by the positive mix, as lower-margin segments softened while higher-margin segments grew strongly. The company's business is well-diversified among core markets, such as industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure. Its computing business has been hit by weakness in the PC and notebook areas.Linear also includes tablets, server and storage revenue here, so the consistent decline in segment revenue indicates that growth in other areas is not being offset by weakness in the core computing segment. While this means that the company is not benefiting from the strong growth opportunity, it also means that it is probably leaving lower-margin opportunities on the table (a long-time management strategy).Linear has always maintained strong gross margins and when conditions worsened following the latest recession, it took all the necessary steps (shut-downs, slower hiring, reduction in profit sharing, etc.) to maintain margins in the weak demand environment. While these actions have optimized costs, Linear continues to carry some extra capacity that remains under-utilized.Another positive is the extreme caution that distributors have shown in recent times, which indicates that distributor inventories remain very lean. Therefore, Linear should benefit from its operating leverage and lean channel inventories when demand picks up.Linear shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Linear Tech Meets Q3 Earnings Estimate - Analyst Blog@2013-04-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/linear-tech-meets-q3-earnings-estimate-analyst-blog-2013-04-22

"ecently, Texas Instruments (  ) or ""TI"" narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2012.The chipmaker now expects sales of $2.89-$3.01 billion versus its previous guidance of $2.83-$3.07 billion. The earnings outlook has also been trimmed to 5-9 cents from the previous guidance of 23-31 cents.The current earnings guidance includes 21 cents of charges associated with previously announced restructuring in the company's Wireless segment.Recently, TI announced its restructuring program wherein the company plans to cut 1,700 jobs worldwide in order to reduce operational costs, shut down its wireless chip operations, and concentrate on embedded solutions like automobiles, industrial and other non-consumer markets, which have a longer life cycle. The company expects to incur total charges of approximately $325 million in the fourth quarter.It is encouraging that despite the weak macro environment, the company has not lowered the midpoint of the revenue guidance. With game consoles and e-books doing well for TI, the company cited weakness in wireless infrastructure and industrial markets.In order to retain its position in the world, it is imperative that TI continues to undertake various initiatives and develop new products, keeping in mind the interest of the organization in both the long and short run. We believe the restructuring action will bring in stability and steady earnings growth in the near future.Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits. In the third quarter, TI posted decent numbers, with both revenue and earnings surpassing our expectations. The company's compelling product line-up, increasing differentiation in its business, restructuring activities and lower-cost 300mm capacity should drive earnings in the longer term.Currently, Texas Instruments has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold).

 (  ) reported first-quarter 2013 earnings of 44 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items, but include stock-based compensation expense.Analog Devices generated revenues of $622.1 million, down 10.0% sequentially and 4.0% year over year and at the lower end of the management's revenue guidance range of $612-$653 million (a 6%-12% sequential decline).The  market generated 45% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 8.0% sequentially and 3.0% year over year). This is a diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments. Management optimism gave way in the last quarter, as the macro weakness had Analog's industrial customers (both distribution and OEM) cutting inventories and orders.Management expects the industrial end market to register strong growth in the second quarter as order rates have been improving since early January. generated 20% of total revenue, down 12.0% sequentially but up 2.0% year over year. The decline was broad based, with the largest sequential decrease coming from the wireless infrastructure sub-segment. Though the market performed poorly in the last quarter, management expects the business to improve, as there is great focus on 4G and LTE by leading phone makers, such as Samsung and  (  ). Analog Devices has offerings for both the traditional and 4G networks, so it stands to gain when there is any increase in demand. Additionally, it has higher content in the 4G segment, which along with its position at leading OEMs should remain a positive factor influencing revenue growth.The  segment, which Analog clubs with the computing and handset businesses, was down 22.0% sequentially and 6% year over year, due to seasonality.The  segment generated around 17% of Analog Devices' first quarter revenues, down 3.0% sequentially and 11.0% from the year-ago quarter. Sluggish demand in Europe due to weaker sales affected Analog's automotive revenues in the last quarter. The growing electronic content in vehicles remained a positive however, with demand for products like driver assistance and powertrain efficiency systems remaining strong.The sequential and year-over-year decline in revenues was broad-based across product lines.Analog signal processing products (85% of total revenue) were down 11.0% sequentially and 3.0% year over year. Converters were down 10.0% sequentially and 3.0% year over year. Amplifier revenues declined 10.0% sequentially and 4.0% year over year. Other analog products were down 15.0% and 1.0% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 6% of revenues, down 14.0% sequentially and 12.0% from the year-ago quarter.

The dividend hike was also quite encouraging in the last quarter.Given these positives, it is not surprising that the revenue guidance was up sequentially but below the consensus expectations of $666 million. However, with continued uncertainty in key markets, the shares may remain range bound in the near term.Currently, Analog has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ecently,  , a leading provider of low-power wireless sensor network (WSN) technology, announced its decision to raise its quarterly dividend by 1 cent to 26 cents per share.Additionally, the board also consented to the payment of the current quarter dividend in December, ahead of the customary February timeframe, keeping in mind the interest of the shareholders. Consequently, the increased dividend will be paid on December 28, 2012 to stockholders of record as of December 17, 2012.The 4% increase in dividend is encouraging and should support share prices in the sluggish market. Given its size and scale of operations, Linear generates steady cash flows and therefore investors are welcoming the returns.During the recently concluded first quarter of 2013, Linear spent $5.1 million on share repurchases and $58.8 million on dividends. The cash and short-term investments balance was $1.32 billion at quarter-end, increasing $116.9 million during the quarter.Dividend hikes are a good way of encouraging investor confidence as they return shareholder value. We remain encouraged by Linear's strong cash position. Linear has been paying dividend since 1992 and has increased it every year since then. The current dividend yield is approximately 3%. We believe that continuous hikes in dividend will inspire investor loyalty through higher returns from the stock.Linear reported decent first quarter results with both earnings and revenue increasing sequentially. We think that Linear's business is well-diversified among core markets and the company would generate good results as the economy continues to improve.The weak second quarter guidance sent estimates plunging, which also had the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal years 2013 and 2014 dropping significantly. As a result, Linear has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

This kit can be used in test and measurement, communications, defense and medical equipment. The evaluation kit can be useful in industrial, energy, medical, consumer, telecom and communication, and defense sectors where accurate and reliable results are vital.Data converters have had issues such as lower voltage, lower power and signal swings, which make them prone to noise, grounding and decoupling.HSDC-SEK-10 provides quick evaluation and is a complete solution for powering, clocking and evaluating data, with fast pattern-generating capabilities and low evaluation cost. Thus, these features may put TI's high-speed data converter system ahead of its competitor's offerings.However,  (  ) and  (  ) also offer high speed data converter systems. The success of HSDC-SEK-10 may put TI ahead of its other competitors and help it grow its market share.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, TI generated total revenue of $2.98 billion, down 12.1% sequentially and 12.9% year over year (slightly better than the mid-point of the recently narrowed guidance range of $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion).

 ' (  ) fiscal fourth quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenue fell short of expectations however. The top line softness and disappointing guidance had shares slumping 2.77% in after-hours trading.Analog Devices generated revenue of $695.0 million, which was up 1.7% sequentially, down 3.0% year over year and just within management's revenue guidance range of $685-$715 million (a 0-5% sequential increase).The  market generated 44% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 5.5% sequentially and 3.0% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.Management optimism gave way in the last quarter, as the macro weakness had Analog's industrial customers (both distribution and OEM) cutting inventories and orders. Europe and Japan were the weakest for Analog. Defense, aerospace and medical instrumentation product lines were flat sequentially, but offset by declines across the process control, instrumentation, measurement and medical imaging product lines. generated 20% of total revenue, up 3.8% sequentially and 1.1% year over year. Analog's communications business now constitutes infrastructure sales alone. This business should continue on an uptrend as there is great focus on 4G and LTE by leading phone makers, such as Samsung and  (  ).Additionally, infrastructure buildouts in emerging continues demand for its legacy products. Analog Devices has offerings for both the traditional and 4G networks, so it stands to gain when there is any increase in demand. Additionally, it has higher content in the 4G segment, which along with its position at leading OEMs should remain a positive factor influencing revenue growth. , which Analog clubs with the computing and handset businesses, grew a very strong 26.4% in the last quarter to 20% of revenue. This was still 7.4% below the level generated a year ago. The sequential increase was on driven by some Analog customers building inventories of new products. Therefore, a sharp decline in the next quarter may be expected.The  segment generated around 16% of Analog Devices' fourth quarter revenue, down 3.9% sequentially and 2.0% from the year-ago quarter. Sluggish demand in Europe due to weaker sales and more factory shut-downs impacted Analog's automotive revenue in the last quarter. The growing electronic content in vehicles remained a positive however, with demand for products like driver assistance and powertrain efficiency systems remaining strong.The year-over-year decline in revenue was broad-based across product lines. The other analog category was again the only one posting any substantial increase.Analog signal processing products (85% of total revenue) were up 2.6% sequentially and down 2.2% year over year. Converters were up 2.6% sequentially while declining 5.0% year over year. Amplifier revenue declined 3.5% sequentially and 4.5% year over year. Other analog products jumped 14.1% and 10.9% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenue, flat sequentially and down 13.8% from the year-ago quarter. These products are generally sold into the consumer/computing markets. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.DSPs (8% of total revenue) were down 6.0% sequentially and consistent with the year-ago level.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 63.8%, down 179 basis points (bps) sequentially, 52 bps year over year and short of management's gross margin guidance of 65%. The primary reason for the gross margin decline was the change in sales mix, which favored lower-margin products in the last quarter. However, management also decided to reduce production to align inventories with demand, which had the utilization rate dropping from 74% in the July quarter to 67% in the last quarter.Operating expenses of $228.0 million were down 3.1% sequentially and 1.2% from the October quarter of 2011. Special charges related to restructuring activity were absent in the last quarter, despite which however the operating margin shrunk 13 bps sequentially and 188 bps year over year to 31.0%.The pro forma net income was $179.2 million, or a 25.8% net income margin compared to $169.8 million, or 24.9% in the previous quarter and $183.5 million, or a 25.6% net income margin in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 58 cents compared to 56 cents in the previous quarter and 60 cents in the October quarter of last year.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same.Inventories increased 0.5% to $339.9 million, with annualized inventory turns going up from 3.0X to 3.2X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) dropped from 46 to around 45. Cash generated from operations was around $236.0 million. Analog Devices spent $37.5 million on capex, $91.4 million on cash dividends and $20.8 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.Management expects first quarter revenue of $612-$653 million (a 6-12% sequential decline) with a gross margin of 62%, operating expenses of around $223 million, a tax rate of 18% and diluted EPS of 40-48 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 54 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, well above the guided range.Analog Devices has a significant percentage of its revenue coming from the industrial and automotive markets, both of which are expected to remain sluggish in the near term as macro concerns continue to weigh on its customers. Additionally, the company is now expecting a sharp reduction in its consumer revenue, which will make matters worse.Given these negatives, it is not surprising that the guidance was again below expectations. With continued uncertainty in key markets and the weak guidance, estimates are likely to track lower. This should keep the Zacks Rank at #4 (Sell). In fact, companies with industrial and automotive focus are unlikely to do very well in this environment, for instance,  (  ), which also has a Zacks Rank of #4.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices Flayed by Macro Weakness - Analyst Blog@2012-11-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-flayed-macro-weakness-analyst-blog-2012-11-28
"espite the market being lower early on based on fundamental concerns, all it took was a headline out of Washington from House Speaker Boehner mentioning confidence in the ""fiscal cliff"" talks to send the markets shooting higher. Don't get me wrong, we prefer an up market, but the focus should be on earnings and what can drive share prices higher over the long run. Counting on Washington to be part of the long-term path to prosperity for corporate America just doesn't work. Share prices need to get back in line with fundamentals and not so much with how politicians want to grab the spotlight. In real news today, new home sales fell in October despite expectations for an uptick - yet no one seems to be talking about that point much today.Looking at individual stock movers, Costco (  ) shares were higher following news the company will be paying a $7 special dividend in December (more on the special dividend situation below). PVH Corp (  ) continued its dominant 2012 performance, up again as the company reported its latest earnings results. It's too bad PVH won't reward shareholders with something better than its minuscule dividend.Elsewhere, Analog Devices (  ) rallied from an early drop to close with slight gains, this after the company reduced its 2013 profit guidance. There were plenty of winners by the close, especially after headlines the Federal Reserve remains adamant on continued liquidity for the markets. Some of the big gainers by the close included VF Corp (  ), Coach (  ), Nike (  ), and The Limited (  ).As always, check the  for all our latest coverage of earnings reports, company news, analyst moves, and much more.I had a conversation with a reporter from Reuters yesterday, and the topic was special dividends and accelerated dividend payments. My frustration has been building as more companies turn to paying special dividends ahead of the dividend tax changes likely coming due in 2013.I get the positives from special payouts, but my preference would have been to have these companies that were sitting on all this cash to have been more generous with regular payouts over the past few years. Companies like Wynn Resorts (  ), Las Vegas Sands (  ), Brown-Forman (  ) and this morning's special dividend name, Costco (  ), could have had better yields for the previous couple of years and likely would have been on our Recommended list as a result. At this point, if we rush in to recommend these names because of the payout, we will be left with low-yielding plays once the special dividend is paid out.We always try and avoid playing see-saw with the names on our list. Going in and out of names is not the aim for building wealth through dividend stocks. In the meantime, we sit and watch the special dividend announcements and try and figure out if the names only make sense for the dividend-capture strategy crowd or would they be names that we should be giving stronger merit to because of the one-time payout jewels. All this thanks to the uncertainty out of Washington. Ugh!News was out late yesterday that total U.S. student debt outstanding surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 11% of student loans were 90 days or more past due in the third quarter, up from 8.9% in the previous quarter and 8.8% a year prior.Ironically, this data comes at a time when delinquencies on many other consumer debts, including credit cards and mortgages, are dropping. Students who graduated with a bachelor's degree this spring left school with roughly $28,700 in student debt, up 31% from five years ago, according to FinAid.org. And in many cases, borrowers who've fallen behind on loans dropped out of college. Now, we all know the government can come up with all sorts of payment options including income-based payments, since these loans have to get paid at some point. If the trend continues, expect to hear about what Washington may want to do to keep this fire from getting out of control.A recent study done by New York University professor Edward N. Wolff shows the median net worth of American households has now reached a 43-year low of $57,000 (in 2010 dollars). According to Wolff, between 1983 and 2010, the percentage of households with less than $10,000 in assets rose from 29.7 percent to 37.1 percent. Over the same period, the richest 1 percent of households increased their average wealth by 71 percent. Now whatever is the exact blame could vary from family to family - poor job record/prospects, mediocre academic performance, too much spending/debt, family crisis, zero ability to invest, etc.What the future will be for these struggling families is hard to say. They certainly won't have the financial flexibility to spend discretionary income, which adds pressure to an already sluggish economic recovery. There certainly isn't an end to the recent spike in governmental financial assistance, but to stop the bleeding, better programs must be in place from day one. The education system as it is today needs to get with how the world is currently working and can't just go with business as usual. We have many good jobs in this country where many of our graduates simply don't possess the knowledge to fill those holes. This is a major problem and despite tuition hikes being pushed through year after year, the knowledge gap still exists.Beyond that, there are blue-collar labor skills that many lack as well. There are many opportunities coming in the energy sector and again, we will have a shortage of qualified employees to fill those roles. Something needs to start being coordinated between labor and academia if we are ever going to stabilize the job market and get struggling families hope beyond worrying about when their potential assistance benefits may run out. Will the politicians who ran on the message of better job opportunities and education step up, or will they fade out of sight until the next election season is upon us? We'll see soon enough.We want to make sure everyone understands that the stocks on our  are the names we currently like for new investor capital, regardless of what date the stock was first recommended on. If and when a stock is removed from the list, we will clearly state whether the stock should be sold (which is rare but occasionally will happen), or simply held in one's account until we see a better entry point or catalyst.And here's one last thing to remember about what we do here at Dividend.com: it's not just the names that we recommend that can help you build wealth, but also the things we try to steer you away from that are just as important.

"he holidays tend to bring out the silly market action that retail investors gravitate to unwisely. Check out the action/trading volume in names like Alacatel-Lucent (  ), Groupon (  ), and Nokia (  ), as examples of sub-$5 speculation/gambling that tends to occur this time of the year. The action is fast and furious and will inevitably burn many an unsuspecting investor.With the early positive reports that more shoppers than ever are partaking in the ""Black Friday"" spend-a-thon, the markets saw this news as a lift for today's action. There wasn't much Wall Street research on the street for today's half-day session, but looking at some of today's risers, we saw names like Microsoft (  ) (bouncing back from last week's big executive resignation), Whole Foods Market (  ) (momentum players looking to chase the usual growth plays), Apple (  ) (the stock is hoping to shake off the big drop it has suffered of late), and Coach (  ) (one potential beneficiary from this weekend's spend-fest) all moving higher. We had the usual light-volume sort of session we tend to get for the half-day action following Thanksgiving holiday.We will soon be inundated with the one-day/weekend holiday spending figures. Wal-Mart Stores (  ) is already saying their Thanksgiving Day numbers are ahead of last year's pace (this despite the concerns of workers protesting having to work on a holiday). The media will be all over the positive data points as proof the economy has turned the corner once again. Hand most individuals of any economic status a piece of plastic to be able to go into a store or order online new tech goodies or the latest fashions, and it will be hard to resist from a human nature standpoint. After all, who do we know who walks around with their savings account book showing how much money they have put into their accounts to save? It's not as glamorous as showing off the latest smartphone or designer handbag, or whatever else we have been groomed to accept as success status.Wouldn't it be great to hear figures about money flowing into investments rather than outflows? Not to be the grinch of the holidays, but maybe one day the masses will understand that saluting the idea of spending money above where many should be putting elsewhere (emergency savings, retirement, college funds, etc.) is the biggest misnomer ever cast on us. It takes many hours of our sacrifice and dedication to work hard for the money we receive, but all it takes is one swipe of the credit card to wipe away all the efforts with little to show for it over time.If we can all put the bulk of our efforts finding income-producing assets and investment resources like Dividend.com and others that can assist us in growing the capital we work so hard for, we will not need to ever worry when we do want to spend our money. That's the position we should all be striving for and saluting, not the throngs of shoppers who are just piling on debt and little else.We just wanted to let everyone know that we are working hard on a new 2013 Dividend Guide, loaded with our thoughts on what to expect in the coming year for dividend stocks. Again, this is only available to Dividend.com Premium members for download, so be sure you are signed up to receive the guide once it's released!

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its third-quarter fiscal 2012 results on October 22, 2012, and we notice upward as well as downward movements in analyst estimates.Texas Instrumentsdelivered a decent second quarter with pro forma earnings per share of 46 cents, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.The company reported revenue of $3.34 billion, up 6.9% sequentially and toward the middle of the revised guidance range of $3.22-$3.48 billion. The strength in the quarter came from growth in core analog, led by power management and HVAL.Gross margin was 49.5%, down 22 basis points (bps) sequentially, impacted by lower insurance proceeds. It also declined 199 bps from the year-ago quarter, mainly on account of low utilization rates as well as lower revenue.Recently, the company narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the third quarter of 2012.The chipmaker now expects sales of $3.27-$3.41 billion versus its previous guidance of $3.21-$3.47 billion. The earnings outlook range has also been raised to 38-42 cents per share from the previous guidance of 34-42 cents.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Over the last 30 days, only 1 out of the 30 analysts providing estimates made an upward revision, while none made downward revisions for the third quarter. For fiscal 2012, 8 out of 21 analysts made downward revisions, with none of the estimates moving in the opposite direction.Recently, management revised its revenue and earnings guidance for the third quarter but did not reduce the midpoint of the guidance, allaying investor concerns. Analysts, by and large, expect results to come in line with the revised guidance.The company stated that insurance receipts of $60 million related to the 2011 earthquake in Japan and various restructuring activities will likely help earnings in the upcoming quarter.However, a few analysts expect revenue and earnings to come in below the guidance range. They continue to believe that the ongoing macro weakness and strong competition from tablets and smartphones will likely hit TI's computing market. The analysts also contend that a slowdown in Europeand mature markets could be an added concern.Recent reports from Israeli newspaper Calcalist stated that Amazon (AMZN) was in advanced talks to buy TI's OMAP business. The majority of analysts see this as a clear positive for TI as it would remove a major investor overhang. They believe that the sale would bring in a lot of cash, which will allow management to reduce its huge debt balance, currently estimated to be $4.2 billion.Longer term, majority of the analysts contend that TI's analog and embedded businesses will continue to drive growth. They see potential margin expansion opportunities from the company's cost cutting initiatives along with growth in higher-margin businesses. Additionally, the analysts contend that 300mm RFABand cost synergies from the NSMacquisition will likely lead to margins and earnings upside going forward.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 45 cents for the third quarter, but was down 2 cents to $1.66 for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate was down by 3 cents for the third quarter and by 8 cents for fiscal 2012.Though we remain optimistic about Texas Instruments' compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and its lower-cost 300mm capacity, we expect the company to report in-line third quarter results due to a weak PC market worldwide and a challenging global economy.Though the wireless segment has been struggling for a while, TI recently announced that it was seeing some improvement owing to new tablet launches that use the company's ARM-based OMAP processors. Also, its new analog and embedded processing designs getting into volume production should help the gross margin to move up toward its long-term target of 55%.On the cost front, we believe the company has taken a number of steps in 2011 by closing a couple of 6-inch facilities in Hiji, Japanand Houston, Texasand transitioning the remaining products to more advanced facilities. The restructuring is expected to generate annual savings of $100 million a year.However, we remain concerned about the macro weakness, Texas Instruments' larger exposure to wireless communications infrastructure, and National's huge debt balance, which has negatively impacted the balance sheet.Increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) is also a matter of concern.We, therefore, have a short-term Hold rating (Zacks #3 Rank) on Texas Instruments shares.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Texas Instruments - Analyst Blog@2012-10-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-texas-instruments-analyst-blog-2012-10-18
 . (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal fourth-quarter 2012 results on November 27. We see a few downward revisions in analyst estimates prior to the earnings release.Analog Devices' third quarter 2012 pro forma earnings of 56 cents were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue in the quarter was $683.0 million, up 1.2% sequentially and just within management's revenue guidance range of $682-$702 million, attributable to strong sales across a wide range of communications infrastructure applications, partially offset by weakness in the automotive and industrial segments.Gross margin of 65.6% was up sequentially on account of slightly better utilization rates. However, operating margins shrunk 43 basis points (bps) sequentially due to special charges related to restructuring activity.Management expects fourth quarter revenue between $685 million and $715 million (a 0-5% sequential increase), gross margin of 65%, operating expenses of around $231 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 54 to 60 cents.(Detailed third quarter earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 20 analysts providing estimates for the fourth quarter, 2 analysts made downward revisions while 1 out of 22 analysts providing estimates for fiscal 2012 made a downward revision in the last 30 days.The majority of analysts expect fourth quarter revenue/earnings to come in below Street consensus estimate due to a weak overall demand environment. They expect poor demand particularly in the Industrial and Communications end markets, which together comprise roughly 67% of Analog's total revenue.They also expect a weak first quarter guidance due to the sluggish macro environment and tight inventory management.However, a few analysts believe that share gains in its Automotive and Consumer segments could help to mitigate the decline. The analysts also remain positive about the fact that the company has none to very little PC exposure and believe that the consumer business is expected to grow at a robust pace.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 57 cents and $2.13 for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimates also remained unchanged over the 90-day period.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. We remain encouraged by the company's dominant position in many of its product segments, and meaningfully improved gross and operating margin structures.However, given recent weak reports by its peers, the continued macro sluggishness and continued softness within the industrial infrastructure markets, we do not expect Analog Devices to report a strong fourth quarter.Currently, Analog Devices has a Zacks #4 Rank (short-term Sell rating), reflecting end market weakness and a disappointing fourth quarter guidance provided by management.We note that analog peer  (  ) also carries a Zacks #4 Rank, although others like  (  ) and  (  ) carry a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Analog Devices - Analyst Blog@2012-11-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-analog-devices-analyst-blog-2012-11-26

 (  ) recently announced that it created a Corporate Venture Group to invest in startup companies with innovative technologies.Maxim with its newly formed Corporate Venture Group will make strategic investments in startup ventures and their seed technologies that are concurrent with the company's core areas of expertise in semiconductor products and services. Where it makes sense for Maxim, it will also extend the partnership deal to nurture the newbies with financial assistance for growth and expansion.Maxim's exposure to fast-growing markets, such as smartphone, tablets PC, factory-automation equipment and automotive requires the company to stay abreast of technological advancements. The level of innovation in these markets is typically very high and product cycles are short. Therefore, it is very easy to lose a socket (miss a design cycle), which could result in significant losses for the company.Maxim expects the venture to result in suitable partnerships that could help it stay ahead of its competitors such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), among others. The venture will help Maxim to become leader in key market segments.It will also provide Maxim with access to new, exciting and futuristic technologies that can change the shape of the industry. Maxim will mainly focus on technology for automotive, industrial, mobility and communications as these are the high-growth markets currently.Maxim has a long history of acquisitions. In 2012, it acquired Genasic Design Systems Ltd. that makes chips for LTE applications. In 2011, it acquired SensorDynamics, a semiconductor company that develops proprietary sensor and microelectromechanical (MEMS) solutions. Maxim has been reasonably active on the M&A front. Therefore, it is possible that the new venture will not only bring partners, but also identify suitable acquisition targets.In the fourth quarter of 2012 (the last-reported quarter), Maxim posted revenue of $605.0 million, up 5.9% sequentially, down 3.4% year over year and within management's guidance range of $590.0-620.0 million.

According to management, Avnet Express will provide a user-friendly platform to the design engineers through which they can easily access the latest products ranges.The company's broad portfolio of products and services and its continued efforts to provide maximum consumer satisfaction have both elevated its position and rendered it more secure to hold a substantial market share in the present scenario. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, revenues from Avnet's Electronics Marketing (EM) declined 5.0% from the year-ago quarter to $3.76 billion, within management's guidance range of $3.75 billion - $4.05 billion. We can be hopeful of a better performance by this segment in the upcoming quarters. For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the company projects EM sales to be in the range of $3.55 billion - $3.85 billion.Avnet faces fierce competition from big players in the semiconductor industry. One of the stalwarts here is  (  ), which remains an immensely formidable rival, especially in the current times. In addition, there are several other big players such as  (  ) and  (  ) in the industry.The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and for fiscal 2013 are 84 cents and $4.11, representing a year-over-year growth of (6.79)% and 1.33%, respectively.

 (  ) recently launched a complete smart-meter system-on-a-chip (SoC) called Zeus for the smart grid. The new smart meter SoC will provide reliability, accuracy, faster processing power and advanced security for communication protocols.A smart meter keeps a record of the power consumed, provides information about usage and helps utility companies for billing purposes.Maxim's Zeus is superior because it allows greater precision in the measurement of power within the smart grid and the efficient communication of the information as required. It also takes care of security, which is becoming more of a concern because smart meters are increasingly getting connected.In the present day, there is a growing imbalance between demand and supply of energy, due to a rise in the world population, greater industrialization and depleting natural resources to feed this demand. This is leading to energy efficient structures such as the smart grid. Global energy consumption is expected to reach 20-trillion kilowatt-hours in 2012 and to grow another 10 trillion hours by 2035. Business market researcher marketsandmarkets.com states that the global smart grid market is expected to reach $80.6 billion from $22.8 billion at a CAGR of 28.7% from 2011 to 2016.Thus, this is a good time for Maxim to build capabilities in the space that could help it tap this immense growth opportunity. Maxim's product portfolio also boasts other smart-meter SoCs like Newport, Metrology SoCs, G3-PLC powerline modem, Secure microcontroller, Power-management controller, 24-bit sigma-delta ADC and the latest being Zeus.Maxim is facing competition from other analog makers such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  )  (  ) among others.In the fourth quarter of 2012 (the last-reported quarter), Maxim posted revenue of $605.0 million, up 5.9% sequentially, down 3.4% year over year and within management's guidance range of $590.0-620.0 million.

The company also said that the wireless segment is doing better than initially expected owing to new tablet launches that use the company's ARM-based OMAP processors. However, TI expects the demand for the chips to be at the low end of its expectations due to weak markets in Europe.Recently, chip maker  (  ) slashed its sales forecast for the third quarter on account of lower-than-expected demand for the chips and a challenging global economy. Intel shares fell 3.61% to $24.19 following the guidance revision.Hence, most of the investors expected TI to lower its guidance due to soft market conditions. But fortunately, the company has not reduced the midpoint of the guidance, allaying investor concerns.TI's compelling product line-up, the increased differentiation in its business, restructuring activities and lower-cost 300mm capacity should drive earnings in the longer term.

In so doing, Debt/EBITDA substantially improved from 2.81x to 1.92x, which ultimately provided the company access to more favorable debt markets. This level of debt reduction, along with the company's repurchase of 52 million shares, has cut its diluted share count from 553 million to 438 million shares-a 20% decrease in shares outstanding. It is worth noting that even after this hefty $700 million spend, the company still had the ability to issue its first dividend in nearly a decade.""Interpublic has a $4.92 billion market cap.

Eleven Gurus initiated AIG positions in the first half of 2012, of which six initiated in the second quarter, including Third Point's Daniel Loeb, who discussed the purchase at length in his third-quarter letter:""Longer term, we believe the company's operational turnaround will help AIG realize its intrinsic value, as Chartis, AIG's property and casualty arm, improves its return on equity to the targeted 10 - 12% by 2015,"" Loeb wrote.AIG on Tuesday trades for $36.65, about two-thirds of its $58.82 second-quarter book value.

"emiconductor maker Texas Instruments, Inc. (  ) on Wednesday received some mixed commentary from analysts at Jefferies & Co.The firm reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and $33 price target on TXN, which suggests a 15% upside to the stock's Tuesday closing price of $28.58. However, Jefferies lowered its 2012 earnings estimate from $1.73 to $1.69 per share, and its 2013 view from $2.25 to $2.12.A Jefferies analyst commented, ""Ex-$60m insurance proceeds from last year's Japan quake, TI missed its prior SepQ revenue guidance by 185bps but met the EPS target at the mid-point due to cost reductions.

"esterday's market reversal was carrying the same cautious tone into today's early session, but we did see some investor interest following the release of recent Federal Reserve minutes, which hinted at the possibility of further monetary easing. This certainly helps fuel a resurgence in the price of gold and other commodities. The net result is likely more continued bad news for savers who are not putting money to work.Earnings results did push the averages, with results from Dell (  ), Analog Devices (  ), and Eaton Vance (  ) pushing the needle lower, while solid numbers boosted companies like William Sonoma (  ) and American Eagle Outfitters (  ). Aside from those story names, the selling we saw in the tape moved across various sectors. Some of the well-known names moving lower included Vornado Realty Trust (  ), Caterpillar (  ), and Northrop Grumman (  ).Government data released this past Friday showed jobless rates rose in 44 states during the month of July, as opposed to 27 states for the month of June. When I read definitive data like this, it certainly gives me pause to join the chorus of rebounding real estate sales and improving job hiring sentiment.So why do we see so many calls for a real estate recovery that seems non-existent? Well, we all know the real estate industry has been a big source of economic spending (advertising) as well as a real battleground for political lobbyists. Just a few days ago, news the Republican Party was willing to add the mortgage interest deduction back on their platform showed just how influential builders and realtors are in getting voters aware of potential tax implications headed their way. It also shows how much weight they still pull in Washington.Unfortunately for stock investors, Wall Street doesn't have the same standing these days when it comes to influencing politicians to lower taxes. If either party shows an inclination to side with Wall Street, let's say keeping capital gains rates at current levels, they could be asking for a tough campaign. Politicians tend to buckle quickly if they know their campaign stance is not of the popular vote. Of course, we all know politicians aren't exactly honest in their campaign promises, so any proposed tax hikes or cuts could fall quickly by the wayside once the elections end.I'm certainly no shill for Wall Street, but when you look deeper at how poorly assets have performed for many (real estate vs. stocks), stocks have at least rebounded to 4-year highs. Those who managed to avoid speculative equities and value traps, and stick to quality dividend-paying stocks, have seen tremendous portfolios gains. Outside of few elite markets, the same can not be said for real estate.In fact, demographic trends facing the U.S. would caution against a huge snap-back in real estate values, especially with the unemployment picture we have today. We have two decades plus of growing retirees who will likely be looking to downsize from their current living situation (and they mostly should as part of an overall smart financial retirement strategy of having less fixed costs), and will be adding to the supply of homes for sale. Whether or not we have a bulging shadow inventory of bank-owned homes that many claim, the supply/demand ratio remains tilted to one of continuing supply.Again, I am not speaking out against home ownership more than I am asking individuals to look at the facts when it comes to your investment dollars. There are solid real estate investments out there if you can locate positive cash-flow situations or have experience in the foreclosure side of renovating homes and re-selling or renting them out. But when it comes to residential real estate, there are still very few markets where price appreciation can be counted on.Unfortunately all the media hype in the world can not willfully move the real value of what we own (homes, stocks, etc.) - not that the business media doesn't attempt it. So you can not overlook the facts provided by influencing data points. With more and more citizens relying on government assistance and slowly dropping out of the employment picture, do you think these folks are worrying about buying homes? These people are just trying to survive from day-to-day and week-to-week. For actual real estate appreciation to take place in a majority of markets, we need a major positive trend shift in the job markets. We don't currently see it yet and that's the fact.Do we think stocks are immune to danger with the points I am making above? Certainly not, but there are some industries and companies that should be able to shoulder a sustained search for an economic bottom better than others. Our job is to find those names and continue to monitor them when it comes to investors deciding where their hard-earned capital should be aimed at. This year's Presidential election will no doubt have market-watchers (including us of course) trying to come up with all sorts of scenarios to how investors should be positioned going forward.

ntegrated circuits maker Analog Devices, Inc. (  ) late Tuesday posted mixed fiscal third quarter earnings results and offered a tepid fourth quarter outlook.The Norwood, MA-based company reported fiscal third quarter net income of 56 cents per share, which matched Wall Street estimates. ADI's revenue of $683 million missed the consensus analyst estimate of $692 million, however.Looking ahead, Analog Devices forecast fiscal fourth quarter earnings to range from 54 to 60 cents per share, on $685 million to $715 million in revenue. Analysts are currently looking for 60 cents on $714.60 million in revenue.Analog Devices shares posted small losses in aftermarket trading Tuesday.Shares of Analog Devices (  ) have a 2.97% dividend yield, based on today's closing stock price of $40.34.

ollowing the second quarter 2012 earnings announcement on July 23, more than half of the analysts covering  (  ) have made downward revisions to their estimates. Low visibility, slow end market demand, weak order trends, European macro concerns, and intensifying competition could be the reasons for downward revisions.Texas Instruments delivered a decent second quarter with pro forma earnings per share of 46 cents, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.The company reported revenue of $3.34 billion, which was up 6.9% sequentially and toward the middle of the recently narrowed guidance range of $3.22-$3.48 billion. The strength in the quarter came from growth in core Analog, led by power management and growth in HVA and Logic.Gross margin was 49.5%, down 22 basis points (bps) sequentially, impacted by lower insurance proceeds. It also declined 199 bps from the year-ago quarter, mainly on account of low utilization rates as well as lower revenue.Estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter indicate declining sentiments, with 22 out of 27 analysts making downward revisions in the last 30 days. Also, for fiscal 2012, 17 out of 22 analysts made downward revisions, with only 1 analyst moving in the opposite direction.The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 48 cents when the company reported its second quarter earnings. Texas Instruments projected third quarter revenue to come in between $3.21 billion and $3.47 billion (flat sequentially at the mid-point), well below the consensus estimate of $3.54 billion. The earnings for the quarter are expected at 34 cents to 42 cents per share.The weak guidance provided by the management made the analysts to lower their estimates which took the Zacks Consensus Estimate to 44 cents. The analysts are also of the opinion that Baseband continues to be a headwind for the Wireless segment, which the company expects to phase out completely by the end of the year.The majority of analysts believe that TI's guidance reflects a broad-based market slowdown, as well as company-specific weakness in wireless. However, they contend that once the end-markets improve, the company will recover soon, given its compelling product line, new design wins and significant gross margin leverage.However, longer term, the analysts believe that TI's analog and embedded businesses will continue to drive growth. They also see potential margin expansion opportunities from the company's cost cutting initiatives along with growth in higher-margin businesses. Additionally, the analysts contend that 300mm RFAB and cost synergies from the NSM acquisition will likely lead to margins and earnings upside going forward.Impact on EstimatesAs the majority of analysts have lowered their estimates over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen 5 cents to 44 cents for the upcoming quarter and 7 cents to $1.69 for fiscal 2012. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 6 cents for the upcoming quarter and 11 cents for fiscal 2012.We remain optimistic about Texas Instruments' compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and its lower-cost 300mm capacity. Also, the addition of National Semiconductor strengthens its product line-up and brings on board additional capacity.We also believe that some of the new designs (analog and embedded processing products) getting into volume production should help the gross margin to move up toward its long-term target of 55%.Moreover, in 2011, the company announced the closure of a couple of 6-inch facilities in Hiji, Japan and Houston, Texas, transitioning the remaining products to more advanced facilities. Of the $215 million in charges, $112 million were taken in the fourth quarter of 2011, with the remainder being spread out over the next seven quarters. The restructuring is expected to generate annual savings of $100 million a year.However, we remain concerned about the macro weakness, Texas Instruments' larger exposure to wireless communications infrastructure, and National's huge debt balance, which has negatively impacted the balance sheet.Increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) is also a matter of concern.We, therefore, have a short-term Hold recommendation (Zacks Rank #3) on Texas Instruments' shares.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Scorecard: Texas Instruments - Analyst Blog@2012-07-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-scorecard%3A-texas-instruments-analyst-blog-2012-07-30
 (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal third-quarter 2012 results on August 21. We have seen downward movements in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.Analog Devices' second quarter 2012 pro forma earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents on the back of stronger-than-expected revenue and margins.Revenue in the quarter was $675.1 million, up 4.2% sequentially, particularly attributable to strong sales across a wide range of industrial and communications infrastructure applications. The consumer segment performed poorly in the quarter but orders started strengthening toward the end of the period, indicating improving trends that should lead to stronger revenues going forward.Gross margin of 65.2% was up sequentially, driven by higher utilization rates and a stronger mix of high-margin industrial and communications infrastructure products.Management expects third quarter revenue between $682 million and $702 million (a 1-4% sequential increase), operating expenses of around $231 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 54 to 58 cents.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: For the third quarter, one estimate out of 18 total was revised downward in the last 30 days. For fiscal 2012, two estimates declined in the same amount of time.The majority of analysts expect a decent third quarter with revenue in line with the Street consensus estimates of $692 million. However, they expect a weak fourth quarter guidance due to the sluggish macro environment.The analysts expect to see strength in the Communications and Consumer end markets. They contend that 3G/4G deployments in China and North America will drive the company's future revenue growth. They also believe that wireless infrastructure is another area of revenue growth with strength in wireless base station build-outs owing to continued expansion into China, Europe and North America.However, a handful of analysts expect a weak quarter due to uncertainty in the current environment. They expect weak demand particularly in the industrial and automotive end markets, which together comprise roughly 65% of Analog's total revenue.In the past 30 days, there was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter but the estimate for fiscal 2012 dropped by a penny to $2.15.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 2 cents to 56 cents for the third quarter and 3 cents to $2.15 for fiscal 2012.The weak demand environment and lower-than-expected guidance seem to have prompted the reduction in estimates.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. We remain encouraged by the company's dominant position in many of its product segments, and meaningfully improved gross and operating margin structures.However, we do not expect Analog Devices to see a strong third quarter due to the tough macroeconomic environment and softness within the industrial infrastructure markets.Analog Devices, which competes with other large analog players such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), holds a Zacks #3 Rank that translates into a short-term 'Hold' rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Analog Devices - Analyst Blog@2012-08-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-analog-devices-analyst-blog-2012-08-20
n line with its plans announced earlier on its conference call, analog IC-maker  is injecting $200.0 million into its four wafer fabrication facilities in Beaverton, Oregon; Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; and San Jose, California.While Maxim did mention that the funds would be used for upgrading and modernizing its facilities, it did not specify how long this would take. However, the company expects fourth quarter capex to skew expectations for 2012 while capex for 2013 remains within the guided range. This seems to indicate that most of the charge will be taken in the fourth quarter itself and any additional expenditure will be spread out evenly over time.Maxim's exposure to fast-growing markets, such as smartphone, tablets PC, factory-automation equipment and automotive requires the company to stay abreast of technological advancements. The level of innovation in these markets is typically very high and product cycles are short. Therefore, it is very easy to lose a socket (miss a design cycle), which could result in significant losses for the company.Therefore, Maxim's decision to replace old machinery with next-generation equipment, upgrade its process technology, move to newer technology nodes and consolidate production from recent acquisitions comes at the right time. We believe that this initiative is likely to improve Maxim's competitive position versus peers such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), among others.As per research conducted by IDC, the global semiconductor market grew 3.7% to $301.0 billion in 2011. Further, the market is expected to grow 6-7% this year. Estimates provided by Databeans indicate that the analog segment of the market contributed over $42 billion, or 14%. Maxim was the fifth largest player in the segment, with a 4.8% market share, having grown around 4% from 2010.In the third quarter of 2012 (the last-reported quarter), Maxim posted revenue of $571.2 million, down 3.4% sequentially, 5.9% year over year and within management's guidance range of $555.0-585.0 million. Revenue was down across all end-markets except industrial, which was flat sequentially.Currently, Maxim Integrated Products Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Maxim to Modernize U.S. Fabs - Analyst Blog@2012-07-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/maxim-to-modernize-u.s.-fabs-analyst-blog-2012-07-13
" ' (  ) fiscal third quarter earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, revenue fell short of expectations.Analog Devices generated revenue of $683.0 million, which was up 1.2% sequentially but down 9.9% year over year and just within management's revenue guidance range of $682 million to $702 million (a 1% -4 % sequential increase).The  market generated 47% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 0.4% sequentially and 11.4% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments. Demand from distribution was relatively steady right through the quarter, with order patterns strengthening slightly toward the end. Analog's customers do not expect further deterioration in their businesses. generated 20% of total revenue, up 9.2% sequentially but down 9.0% year over year. Analog's communications business now constitutes infrastructure sales alone. Management attributed the sequential increase to strength at wireless customers driven by baseband deployment in the U.S., Japan and other Asian countries. Analog Devices has offerings for both the traditional and 4G networks, so it stands to gain when there is any increase in demand. Additionally, it has higher content in the 4G segment, which, along with its position at leading OEMs, should remain a positive factor influencing revenue growth.The  segment generated around 17% of Analog Devices' second quarter revenue, down 2.8% sequentially and up 13.0% from the year-ago quarter. Sluggish demand in Europe impacted results in the last quarter. However, an increase in vehicle sales, growing electronic content in vehicles and growing dollar content per vehicle remain longer-term positives. , which includes the computing (1% of fiscal 2011 revenue) and handset (3% of fiscal 2011 revenue) businesses, generated 16% of revenue, up 0.8% sequentially and down 23.2% from a year ago. The weak point here was digital cameras, with growth in portable media supported by other segments (home entertainment and computing), which came in flat. The positive was strong order growth, which grew the backlog and resulted in a book to bill ratio of over 1.The year-over-year decline in revenue was broad-based across product lines. The ""Other"" analog category was the only one posting any substantial increase.Analog signal processing products (85% of total revenue) were up 1.5% sequentially and down 10.4% year over year. Converters were rather flat sequentially while declining 11.2% year over year. Amplifiers, on the other hand, grew slightly (1.8%) on a sequential basis, while declining 8.4% from last year. Other analog products jumped 8.2% from the previous quarter, but remained 7.9% below the year-ago level. The three product lines generated 44%, 27% and 14% of quarterly revenue, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenue, down 1.4% and 17.3% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. These products are generally sold in the consumer market. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.DSPs (9% of total revenue) were down 2.6% sequentially and 4.4% year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 65.6%, up 33 basis points (bps) sequentially, down 167 bps year over year and short of management's guidance of a 50 bp sequential increase. The sequential improvement was on account of slightly better utilization rates. The decline from the year-ago quarter was mainly on account of significantly lower volumes. Mix was relatively neutral to both the sequential and year-over-year comparisons.Operating expenses of $235.4 million were up 3.5% sequentially and 2.0% from the July quarter of 2011. Special charges related to restructuring activity were $5.8 million in the last quarter, which was the main reason for the operating margin shrinking 43 bps sequentially and 568 bps year over year to 31.1%.The pro forma net income was $169.8 million, or a 24.9% net income margin compared to $162.9 million or 24.1% in the previous quarter and $219.9 million or a 29.0% in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 56 cents, compared to 53 cents in the previous quarter and 71 cents in the July quarter of last year.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were the same.Inventories increased 2.7% to $345.8 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping sequentially from 3.1X to 3.0X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) inched up to 46. Cash generated from operations was around $137.7 million. Analog Devices spent $39.2 million on capex, $89.5 million on cash dividends and $17.3 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.Management expects fourth quarter revenue of $685 million to $715 million (a 0-5% sequential increase) with the gross margin of 65%, operating expenses of around $231 million and diluted EPS of 54 cents to 60 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 60 cents per share when Analog Devices reported, at the high end of the guided range.Given improving order trends toward the end of the quarter and historic low lead times, Analog Devices expects most end markets to turn around in the current quarter. Channel inventories also appear lean, meaning that the company is shipping to consumption.Despite the positive commentary, guidance was again below our expectations likely reflecting conservatism. Particularly so, since Analog's end markets appear to be looking up. Nevertheless, we expect some fine-tuning of estimates, which should keep the company a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold rating over the next 1-3 months).We note that other analog peers, such as  (  ) and  (  ) are also ranked #3 (short-term Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analog Devices' Guidance Disappoints - Analyst Blog@2012-08-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-guidance-disappoints-analyst-blog-2012-08-22

The weakness in other areas was partially offset by a full quarter of National's contribution and a stronger-than-expected wireless business.Texas Instruments' gross margin was 49.7%, up 379 basis points (bps) sequentially, benefitting from the insurance claim received. However, it declined 189 bps from the year-ago quarter, mainly on account of low utilization rates as factory loadings stayed at around 50%.Recently, the company narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the second quarter of 2012.The chipmaker now expects sales of $3.28-$3.42 billion versus its previous guidance range of $3.22-$3.48 billion. The earnings outlook has also been narrowed to 32-36 cents per share from the previous guidance of 30-38 cents.For 2012, TI expects R&D expenses of $2.0 billion, capex of 0.7 billion, depreciation of $1.0 billion and an annual effective tax rate of 28% (could change with re-instatement of federal R&D tax credit that expired in 2011-end).(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Order Trends Point To Growth at TIOut of the 20 analysts providing estimates, none revised the estimate for the second quarter in the last 30 days. Over the same period, 8 out of 23 analysts made downward revisions for fiscal 2012.The analysts lowered their estimates due to their negative view on weak macro-economic conditions and channel inventory destocking. Further, the analysts are of the opinion that the wireless segment will not perform well in the upcoming quarter due to further declines in the baseband business, which the company expects to phase out completely by the end of the year.However, longer term, the analysts believe that TXN's analog and embedded businesses will continue to drive growth for the company. They also see potential margin expansion opportunities from the company's cost cutting initiatives along with growth in higher-margin businesses. Additionally, the analysts contend that 300mm RFAB and cost synergies from the NSM acquisition will likely lead to margins and earnings upside going forward.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased by a penny to 39 cents for the second quarter, but was down 3 cents to $1.74 for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remains unchanged for the second quarter and was up 1 cent for fiscal 2012.We remain optimistic about Texas Instruments' compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and its lower-cost 300mm capacity. Also, the addition of National Semiconductor strengthens its product lineup and brings on board additional capacity.We also believe that some of the new designs (analog and embedded processing products) getting into volume production should help the gross margin to move up toward its long-term target of 55%.However, we remain concerned about the macro weakness, TI's larger exposure to wireless communications infrastructure, and elevated inventory levels.Increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) is also a matter of concern.Hence, we expect the company to report in line with the lowered guidance provided in its mid-quarter update.We, therefore, have a short-term Sell recommendation (Zacks Rank #4) on Texas Instruments shares.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Texas Instruments - Analyst Blog@2012-07-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-texas-instruments-analyst-blog-2012-07-19
"ecently,  (  ), or ""TI,"" narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the second quarter of 2012. The chipmaker now expects sales of $3.28-$3.42 billion versus its previous guidance of $3.22-$3.48 billion. The earnings outlook has also been narrowed to 32-36 cents per share from the previous guidance of 30-38 cents.Though the chipmaker has narrowed its guidance range, the midpoint remains unchanged. According to Thomson Reuters, the analysts also expect sales of $3.35 billion (in line with the midpoint of the management guidance).Specifically, management stated that the wireless segment will decline sequentially. Even in the last quarter, revenue from the wireless segment was impacted by lower demand in the baseband business, which the company expects to phase out completely by the end of the year.However, TI's Analog and Embedded Processing segments are expected to post solid sequential growth. Orders and backlog are also expected to grow sequentially based on strong demand.TI expects the industrial market to recover faster than expected and the addition of a solid product line-up from National Semiconductor, acquired last year, to drive strong overall results this year. On the whole, management commented that the business is doing well and results are expected to be as expected.In the past few quarters, TI had been lowering its guidance due to soft market conditions and weakness in the handset and industrial end markets. This is the first time in the past year that the company has not lowered the midpoint of the guidance. TI remains confident about the end-market recovery and expects National Semiconductor to boost its results in the analog-chip market.Though the first quarter earnings were down 18.4% sequentially and 28.6% year over year, management stated that the first quarter should be regarded as the bottom, with growth expected to return in the second. The fact that orders of $3.24 billion were up both sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter, also point to growth at TI.We believe the addition of National Semiconductor strengthens its product line-up and brings additional capacity onboard. Additionally, the company's compelling product line-up, the increased differentiation in its business, restructuring activities and lower-cost 300mm capacity should drive earnings in the longer term.Increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ) remains a concern.Currently, TI has a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@TI Narrows 2Q Guidance Range - Analyst Blog@2012-06-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ti-narrows-2q-guidance-range-analyst-blog-2012-06-12

"hareholder activists hate to see a company with too much cash. They rattle cages in hopes of getting a company to issue a one-time hefty  , or make some other bold move that can shake up a stock. But many companies simply refuse to listen. They know the  cycles up and down, and they like to keep cash on hand for the next rainy day.Well, with share prices across the stock  in free-fall, that rainy day has arrived. Cash piles are now so large -- especially in the context of quickly-falling stock prices -- that it may be time to put that money to work. As an investor, you should be looking to put your money into these types of companies, because they are best positioned for downside protection in a rough market -- and have plenty of ammo to boost  .I did a little digging and was amazed to find out how many cash-rich companies we're talking about. Looking at the 1,500 companies that make up the S&P 400, 500 and 600, nearly 10% of them now have net cash levels worth at least 20% of their  . And you don't need to focus on tiny, little-known companies to find these cash hoarders. Using $500 million as a minimum market value, and tightening that cash threshold to 25%, you can still find 56 companies that fit the bill, including names I'm a big fan of, such as  ,  ,  and  .Remarkably, there are more than two dozen companies that have net cash that equals at least 33% of the company's market value. At some point soon, these companies may look to support their flagging stock prices with a buyback, an  or a dividend boost. At a minimum, the huge cash balance gives some support to shares -- a key consideration in this panicky market.It's no coincidence that the list is dominated by tech stocks.
These companies always have a predilection for generating cash,
though strong in recent years has left these companies with arguably too much
cash, with more than enough money to handle any challenges an
economic slowdown may bring.It's no coincidence that the list is dominated by tech stocks. These companies always have a predilection for generating cash, though strong  in recent years has left these companies with arguably too much cash, with more than enough money to handle any challenges an economic slowdown may bring.Of course, some of these cash-rich tech plays, such as  and  have recently delivered tepid quarterly results, and there are few reasons to expect these stocks to be bid up right now, except for their pristine balance sheets. All they can do is make the best of a bad situation. For Cisco, this means continued stocks buybacks, which have already shrunk the share count in dramatic fashion.Yet there are some tech stocks with solid catalysts in this group. Take  as an example. The chip maker is in the midst of a major push into the smartphone segment with the third generation of its Tegra chip, which has been designed into 30 different phones hitting the market this year.Management thinks 25 million of these chips will ship this year, roughly double the amount shipped in 2011. The smartphone chip market has historically been dominated by  , though a design win with  and a number of Asian phone makers should make Nvidia a fast-growing number-two player in this market.Shares of Nvidia have slumped to an 18-month low to a recent $12, though analysts at Needham see shares rebounding to $20. That's solid potential upside, with the company's net $5 a share in cash providing downside support.Health care providers also seem to be trading on the cheap in relation to their cash positions. Take  as an example. After falling roughly 20% since the year began, the company is worth $12.4 billion on the market -- not much more than its $11.3 billion net cash position. Why so much cash? Because regulators like to see insurers maintain stable financial positions, but management appears to have overlooked the fact that rising annual cash flow has let the cash balance grow unchecked. It stood at just $5.4 billion at the end of 2008.Management finally understands the need to put that cash to use, recently telling The Wall Street J ournal that Humana may pursue acquisitions that bolster the company's presence with  . A quicker way to satisfy investors? Beef up the dividend, which currently yields just 1.4%. With more than enough cash in place already, Humana could conceivably earmark all future cash flow toward the dividend and instantly create a 15% to 16%  . Even a 6%  would keep most of the company's cash flow in house.Risks to Consider:  The market sell-off is creating deep values, and the  is a fine place to start your research. These companies have built up embarrassingly high levels of cash, and the balance sheets now stand in stark contrast to the share prices.

ircuit maker Analog Devices, Inc. (  ) late Wednesday posted a sharp decline in first quarter earnings, missing analyst estimates.The Norwood, MA-based company reported fiscal first quarter net income of $139.4 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with $222.1 million, or 70 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Last year's results included a big one-time tax benefit.Revenue fell 11% from last year to $648.1 million.On average, Wall Street analysts expected a higher profit of 48 cents per share, on larger revenue of $662.4 million.Looking ahead, ADI forecast second quarter earnings of 48 to 53 cents per share on $655 million to $675 million in revenue.

"ecently,  (  ), or ""TI,"" slashed its revenue and earnings expectations for the first quarter of 2012.The chipmaker now expects sales of $2.99 billion to $3.11 billion, below its previous guidance range of $3.02 billion to $3.28 billion. The earnings outlook has been lowered to 5 cents to19 cents per share from the previous guidance of 16 cents to 24 cents.We believe that management had previously projected revenues to decline as a result of macro weakness and hard disk drive shortages from the Thailand flood.Now, the company also expects the demand for its OMAP application processor, which is used in wireless devices like smartphones and tablets to take a tumble, thereby causing a further decline in the first quarter.As the fourth quarter progressed, TI saw strong demand in the month of December, which pushed up orders during the month. Hence, management expects inventory correction to end very soon and orders to improve going forward. Additionally, TI expects automotive and communications infrastructure end markets to improve and demand to pick up from the second quarter of 2012.Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and DSP integrated circuits. The company reported revenues of $3.42 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011, down 0.8% sequentially and 3.0% year over year.

 ' (  ) fiscal second quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Revenue exceeded the consensus by 1.4%.Analog Devices generated revenue of $675.1 million, which was up 4.2% sequentially, down 14.6% year over year and just over management's revenue guidance range of $655-$675 million (a 1-4% sequential increase).The  market generated 48% of Analog Devices' total revenue (up 11.8% sequentially and down 16.4% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.While each sub-segment grew in the last quarter, instrumentation and energy were up over 20% each.The strong sequential performance is partly on account of positive seasonality and partly driven by improving market conditions, as customer inventories dropped to satisfactory levels, enabling Analog to ship to consumption. generated 19% of total revenue, up 2.5% sequentially and down 22.3% year over year. Analog Devices' communications business now constitutes infrastructure sales alone. Management attributed the sequential increase to both wireline and wireless customers that were prompted by growing data volumes, although growth rates remained low due to the back-end loaded quarter and continued economy-related concerns. , which now includes the computing (1% of fiscal 2011 revenue) and handset (3% of fiscal 2011 revenue) businesses, generated 16% of revenue, down 7.6% sequentially and 20.2% from a year ago. Here too, orders started strengthening toward the end of the quarter, indicating improving trends that should lead to stronger revenues going forward. Analog stated that strong design in at key consumer OEMs would support this growth.The  segment generated around 17% of Analog Devices' second quarter revenue, down 0.9% sequentially and up 10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The increase in vehicle sales, growing electronic content in vehicles and growing dollar content per vehicle for Analog helped sales in the last quarter.The year-over-year decline in revenue was more or less broad-based across product lines, with only the digital signal processing (DSP) products saying flat. On the other hand, all except the other analog category increased sequentially.Analog signal processing products (84% of total revenue) were up 4.2% sequentially and down 15.7% year over year. Converters and amplifiers were up 5.2% and 8.1%, respectively on a sequential basis, while declining 14.3% and 16.6%, respectively from last year.Other analog products were down 5.7% from the previous quarter and 18.2% from the year-ago quarter. The three product lines generated 44%, 26% and 13% of quarterly revenue, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenue, up 2.7% and down 17.9%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters. These products are generally sold into the consumer market. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.DSPs (9% of total revenue) were up 5.3% sequentially and flat year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 65.2%, up 207 basis points (bps) sequentially, down 231 bps year over year and better than management's guidance of 64-64.5%. Both utilization and a stronger mix of high-margin industrial and communications infrastructure products were responsible for the sequential increase. The decline from the year-ago quarter was mainly on account of significantly lower volumes.Operating expenses of $227.5 million were flattish sequentially and down 3.5% from the April quarter of 2011. As a result, the operating margin expanded 324 bps sequentially even as it shrunk 621 bps year over year to 31.5%.Lower cost of sales was the main reason for the sequential increase in margin, although both R&D and SG&A also declined as a percentage of sales. However, all expenses were up significantly as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarter with SG&A increasing somewhat less than the others.The pro forma net income was $162.9 million, or a 24.1% net income margin compared to $139.4 million, or 21.5% in the previous quarter and $245.3 million, or a 31.0% net income margin in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 53 cents compared to 46 cents in the previous quarter and 79 cents in the April quarter of last year.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same.Inventories increased 2.2% to $303.7 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping sequentially from 3.2X to 3.1X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) inched up to a little less than 45. Cash generated from operations was around $226.0 million. Analog Devices spent $30.1 million on capex, $24.2 million on acquisitions, $89.4 million on cash dividends and $44.0 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.Management expects third quarter revenue of $682-$702 million (a 1-4% sequential increase) with the gross margin to increase 50 bps, operating expenses of around $231 million and diluted EPS of 54-58 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 58 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, at the high end of the guided range.Given improving order trends in the back half of the quarter and historic low lead times, Analog expects most end markets to turn around in the current quarter. Channel inventories also appear lean, meaning that the company is now shipping to consumption. However, we detect caution at communications customers, which could mean slower revenue growth in the segment.Despite the positive commentary, guidance was again below our expectations likely reflecting conservatism. Particularly so, since Analog's end markets appear to be looking up.Nevertheless, we expect investor sentiments to remain low, since analysts are likely to lower their earnings estimates to reflect the guidance, thereby strengthening the Zacks Rank of #4 on Analog shares, which implies a Sell rating over the next 1-3 months.We note that other analog peers, such as  (  ) and  (  ) bear a Zacks Rank of #3 (short-term Hold), while  (  ) is currently ranked #2 (short-term Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Sees End Market Recovery - Analyst Blog@2012-05-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-sees-end-market-recovery-analyst-blog-2012-05-23

 (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal second-quarter 2012 results on May 22. We witness only one downward movement in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.Analog'sfirst quarter 2012 pro forma earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents due to weaker-than-expected revenue and margins.Revenue in the quarter was $648.1 million, down 9.5% sequentially and 11.0% year over year, particularly due to the weakness in the consumer, communications and industrial end markets. However, the automotive segment performed well in the quarter on account of increased use of electronic content in automobiles, growing dollar content per vehicle for Analog and higher sales of vehicles.Gross margin of 63.2% was down both sequentially and year over year, impacted by lower utilization rates, as Analog tried to keep internal inventories under control.Management expects second quarter revenue of $655-$675 million (a 1-4% sequential increase) with the gross margin at 64-64.5%, operating expenses of around $226 million and diluted EPS of 48-53 cents. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents, at the high end of the guided range.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 18 analysts providing estimates for the second quarter, none made any revision in the last 30 days. For fiscal 2012, only 1 analyst made a downward revision over the same 30-day time period.The majority of analysts expect a decent second quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS (including options) in line with the Street consensus estimates of $666 million and $0.51, respectively.The analysts expect to see strength in the automotive end market and stabilization in industrial and communications (driven by 3G deployments in China), which have remained weak thus far. They contend that 3G deployments and growing semiconductor content in automobiles will drive the company's future revenue growth. They also believe that wireless infrastructure is another area of revenue growth with strength in wireless base station build-outs owing to continued expansion into China, Europeand North America.However, a handful of analysts do not expect a strong quarter due to some softness in the end markets and uncertainty in the current environment. They state that demand uncertainty has continued, particularly, in industrial and communications end markets, which together comprise roughly 65% of Analog's total revenue.In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter but the estimate for fiscal 2012 dropped a penny to $2.18.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 3 cents to 51 cents for the second quarter and 10 cents to $2.18 for fiscal 2012.The weak demand environment and lower-than-expected guidance announced by management during the first quarter , might have prompted the reduction in estimates.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. We remain encouraged by the company's dominant position in many of its product segments, and meaningfully improved gross and operating margin structures.However, we do not expect Analog Devices to see a strong second quarter due to a tough macroeconomic environment and softness within the communications and industrial infrastructure markets.Analog, which competes with other large analog players, such as Intersil Corporation,  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ),holds a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term 'Sell' rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Analog Devices - Analyst Blog@2012-05-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-analog-devices-analyst-blog-2012-05-18

"he markets continue to circle around the Dow 13K level as investors (and the media) root for the index to break through that big psychological barrier. Economic data was fairly quiet today, with the weekly jobless claims number coming in slightly better than expected.Earnings took center stage today with a bevy of retailers reporting. Seeing positive investor sentiment were shares of Dillard's (  ), Target (  ) (  ) and Tim Horton's (  ). On the flipside, investors reacted negatively to results from Safeway (  ) and Kohl's (  ) (  ). Also moving lower was shares of Hewlett Packard (  ) (  ). We did get a dividend increase from Kohl's as well as Analog Devices (  ) (  ), which also reported earnings today.Yesterday, Smart Money ran a piece highlighting data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that estimated an American who lives to the age of 100 will spend $3.5 million in his or her lifetime. In fact, those in their 60′s spend more than older age groups, on everything from housing to clothes. The latest health statistics indicate the average 50 year-old today can expect to live until 81.Here's an example of the beauty of compounding interest that dividend stocks can provide: Investing just $3,000 into dividend-paying stocks over the course of 5 years and re-investing the dividends over the course of 56 years will grow to  (based on historic 11% annual returns). Most people probably aren't thinking that far out, but consider the fact that we're talking about just a $3,000 total investment.I can't stress enough the power of compound interest. You take a small amount of money and turn it into a large amount over time. Patience and consistency is required, but we all need to begin practicing some discipline if we are going to get the financial ship headed in the right direction.We heard a bit of positive chatter about the pick-up in existing home sales reported yesterday. While the uptick in sales volumes was a positive, the reality is that home prices also fell to their lowest levels in a decade. Distressed home sales, which includes homes in foreclosure and so-called ""short sales"" in which the home is sold for less than what is owed on the mortgage, made up 35% of sales in January.These trends don't exactly indicate any sort of strength in the real estate market. If you just focused on yesterday's headline about sales volumes rising, however, you'd be inclined to think otherwise. I'm not here to beat up on real estate, but from an investment standpoint, I suggest folks look at homes only as places you want to live in. Only if real estate prices stabilize over the long term can a home purchase really be considered any sort of ""investment.""The only proven investment tied to real estate are properties that throw off positive cash flow(multi-family buildings, office buildings, other commercial property). Most seasoned real estate investors look mainly at the cash flow when evaluating a property's investment potential. In some areas, you may see a premium added to the equation due to an expectation of price appreciation, but those are few and far between.Bankrate just released results from a study that indicates Americans are beginning to save a bit more than they have in the past.One key point that stood out was that high-income earners were the least likely to report more credit card debt than savings. It seems obvious that the more money you make, the less likely you will run into financial trouble, which is why I like to often write about the importance of career choices. When you understand what industries had the best earning potential, and what education and skills you should acquire to get those positions, you'll be set up for a strong financial foundation. In turn, that foundation allows you the comfort level to live well and invest. You can get by without a college education of course - just be prepared to work extremely hard to build up wealth over the long term.In  , we outline the do's and don'ts of investing in high-yield Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). Our exclusive new MLP report outlines everything you need to know about these popular high-yield investments, including:- Understanding their unique company structure- What you absolutely need to know about their special tax treatment- Why MLPs may not be suitable for retirement accounts- How to find the best high-yield partnerships- …and much more!Head to the  page to download this brand new report today!We recently updated our list of dividend stocks that have been paying out dividends for 25 years or more. Be sure to check out  .Financial blog DailyReckoning.com recently took a look at the difference dividend payouts made in the overall return investors saw throughout the prior decades. Here are some of the highlights:- The Nasdaq is down 28% since the end of 1999. Even the ""blue chip"" S&P 500 stocks are down 15% during that time frame…until you add back those ""boring"" dividends. With dividends included, the S&P 500′s 15% loss flips to a 6% gain.- Without dividends, the S&P 500 index would have produced a loss for the 25 long years from August 1929 to August 1954. Then again, without dividends, the S&P 500 produced a 5% loss during the 13 years from September 1961 to September 1974. But with dividends included, the S&P's loss became a 46% gain.- Over the course of the last half-century, dividends have contributed more than half of the stock market's total return - 56%, to be exact.Of course, you can't discuss the potency of dividend investing without making mention of how awesome compound returns are. I can't stress enough the power of compound interest: you take a small amount of money and turn it into a large amount over time. Finding the right companies at the right price points which not only grow earnings, but also grow their dividend payouts as well!Be sure to check out our weekly Top 50 High-Yield Watchlist Names post that is out today, exclusively for  members.

"arnings season is often the most dangerous time to be a trader. For dividend investors, however, the market's reaction to earnings reports can present a welcome opportunity. If a stock gets beat up for just meeting analyst estimates, we'll sometimes see momentum traders scamper for the exits over several days, making stocks we've been watching much more enticing.Much like yesterday, today's market action was to the upside, making it tougher to find solid entry points. Despite that fact, we will not hesitate to make a move if we like a dividend stock's prospects near and longer-term.The market acted well, despite several well-known financial names reporting disappointing numbers. The names that didn't participate in today's rally included State Street Corp (  ) (  ), Bank of NY Mellon (  ) (  ), PNC Financial (  ) (  ), and Northern Trust (  ). The one financial name that did enjoy nice gains was Goldman Sachs (  ), which  . Wall Street analyst upgrades also moved the tape higher for the likes of Kraft Foods (  ) and Ralph Lauren Corp (  ) (read more about these upgrades  and  ). Also moving up strong today were semiconductor plays, following a positive report from Linear Technology (  ). Being pushed higher as well were shares of Altera Corp (  ), Analog Devices (  ), and Texas Instruments (  ).Now here's a word of caution when it comes to analyst calls during earnings season. I've seen many instances where analysts like to play ""catch-up"" as far as earnings estimates go, either by raising or cutting numbers just before a particular company's report, only to see the stock move in the opposite direction (stock rallies on a bad report or declines on a good report). So again, just keep this factor in mind as you evaluate stocks that may be on your watch list.Have you ever been a part of a conversation when someone decides to anoint a particular individual with the ""rich"" label? There's not really anything wrong with it, except for when the next part of the conversation moves on to discrediting how he/she was able to get in their particular position.Sure, sometimes people born into wealth squander their head start and blow their family's fortune. Those folks are in the extreme minority, however. The vast majority of ""rich"" people I've known have accumulated wealth as a result of taking risks, working very hard, and spending and investing their money wisely over time. These factors are present no matter what avenue people travel down toward building wealth.Another mistake people often make when discussing ""rich"" people is assuming how ""lucky"" they are. Again, most people have built fortunes through hard work and sacrifice. Luck usually has very little to do with it.Finally, I urge you to be wary about how you discuss the wealthy around children. Young people are very impressionable, and the last thing you want to do is attach a negative stigma to those with money. As I've outlined in this newsletter, building wealth over the long term is not that difficult. Make sure your children or grandchildren understand that. Encourage them to dream big!I tend to excuse myself whenever a negative cloud begins to build about how or why someone is ""financially fortunate."" I exercise my mental muscles each day along my own path to wealth, so why sit among company who will only discredit my goals?Whether viewing a religious statue, a statue of a world leader or politician, or one of a great athlete, all of these monuments have stories behind them. Most of us will never have a statue erected in our memory, but many people build their own kinds of ""statues"" to commemorate their accomplishments.Some will buy a shiny new (or classic) sports car. Others will purchase that massive home they've always dreamed of. Still others will eye up that gold Rolex as a reward for their hard work. There's nothing wrong with desiring these dream objects. Just be sure you've first invested your money wisely in assets that produce income. Once you've built up the financial wherewithal to buy some much-deserved ""toys,"" then enjoy yourself!At Dividend.com, we maintain our focus on the best income-producing investments the markets have to offer during time of heightened volatility. We want to make sure we have only the most pullback-resistant names on our  . Also, if we see the market putting in what looks like a decent bottom, we will be prepared to scale up the list of stocks we like. Stay tuned and be sure to look for  member alerts along the way.

After its  mark since 2008, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is flat heading into today's session. With  seemingly tempered at the moment, and existing home sales the only notable economic report on the domestic docket, traders appear hesitant to make any major moves on the lack of big . Against this muted backdrop, futures on both the DJIA and the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX) are trading just below breakeven.In earnings news, Dell (DELL - 18.21) booked a fourth-quarter profit of $764 million, or 43 cents per share, down 18% from last year's earnings of $927 million, or 48 cents per share. Excluding items, DELL raked in 51 cents per share, while revenue edged up 2.2% to $16.03 billion. The results were mixed, as Wall Street was looking for a profit of 52 cents per share on $15.96 billion in revenue. For the current quarter, DELL is expecting revenue to retreat about 7% sequentially to $14.91 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $15.17 billion. DELL is set to drop 7% right out of the gate.Elsewhere, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE - 31.57) revealed a fourth-quarter profit of $29.9 million, or 54 cents per share, up 37% from $21.9 million, or 36 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding items, earnings came in at 53 cents per share. Meanwhile, revenue rose by 14.6% to $477.7 million, boosted by a 2.7% increase in same-store sales. The results beat analysts' forecast for adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share on revenue of $471.7 million. Looking ahead, the company expects to open seven to eight new locations within the U.S. in the coming year, and as many as three locations in the Middle East. CAKE is trading 3.7% lower ahead of the bell.After the close last night, Herbalife Ltd. (HLF - 62.46) unveiled a fourth-quarter profit of $105.4 million, or 86 cents per share, up 18% from $86.3 million, or 69 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, revenue rose 20% to $884.6 million. The results easily bested Wall Street's forecast for a per-share profit of 73 cents on $856.6 million in sales. Looking ahead, HLF believes its current-quarter earnings will range between 76 cents and 80 cents per share, while analysts are anticipating earnings of 78 cents per share. The nutritional supplements retailer also upped its 2012 profit outlook to a range of $3.40 and $3.60 per share, encompassing the average analyst estimate of $3.49 per share. HLF is up more than 5% in pre-market trading.Finally, Intuit Inc. (INTU - 57.52) banked a fiscal second-quarter profit of $118 million, or 39 cents per share, a 62% year-over-year increase from $73 million, or 23 cents per share. Excluding items, earnings arrived at 51 cents per share. Revenue was also on the rise, jumping 16% to $1.02 billion. Both figures topped analysts' expectations for adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share on $1.01 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, the tax software specialist upwardly revised its outlook for the current quarter, predicting adjusted earnings of $2.47 to $2.51 per share on revenue ranging between $1.95 billion and $1.99 billion. Analysts, meanwhile, are calling for a third-quarter profit of $2.49 per share on $1.98 billion in sales. INTU is set to start the session with a 3.4% lead.Today's earnings docket will also feature reports from Hewlett-Packard (  ), Analog Devices (  ), Angie's List (  ), Boston Beer (  ), CardioNet (  ), Caribou Coffee (CBOU), Clean Harbors (CLH), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Express Scripts (ESRX), Fluor (FLR), Garmin (GRMN), Limited Brands (LTD), MGM Resorts (MGM), NuVasive (NUVA), Onyx Pharmaceuticals (ONXX), Questcor Pharmaceuticals (QCOR), Skullcandy (SKUL), and Toll Brothers (TOL).

The resultant single-session put/call ratio arrived at 0.62, while the 21-day moving average was 0.61.Asian markets ended mostly higher today, but the gains were relatively modest amid lingering Greek caution. In China, traders cheered a four-month peak in HSBC's flash purchasing managers index (PMI), even as the indicator pointed to an ongoing contraction in the country's manufacturing sector. The reading seemed to leave room for further easing measures out of Beijing, following the central bank's weekend decision to trim its reserve requirement ratio for banks. In Tokyo, exporters traded higher as the U.S. dollar gained ground on the yen, while energy stocks advanced as crude prices touched a nine-month high. By the close, Japan's Nikkei rose nearly 1%, China's Shanghai Composite added 0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng tacked on 0.3%, and South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.2%.European equities are pointed south at midday, as traders respond to a disappointing euro-zone PMI reading.

lectronic circuit maker Analog Devices, Inc. (  ) late Monday posted lower-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and offered a weak first quarter outlook.The Norwood, MA-based company reported fiscal fourth quarter net income of $183.5 million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $225 million, or 73 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Revenue fell 7% from last year to $716.1 million.On average, Wall Street analysts expected a higher profit of 64 cents per share on larger revenue of $726.9 million.Looking ahead, the company forecast first quarter earnings of 44 cents to 51 cents per share, on implied revenue of $645 million to $680 million. Analysts currently expect 59 cents for the period on $705 million in revenue.Despite the seemingly terrible earnings report, Analog Devices shares rose 80 cents, or +2.3%, in premarket trading Tuesday.Shares of Analog Devices (  ) have a 2.91% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $34.34. The stock has technical support in the $30-$32 price area. If the shares can firm up, we see overhead resistance around the $38 price level. .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices’ Q4 Earnings Miss View, Offers Weak Forecast (ADI)@2011-11-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-q4-earnings-miss-view-offers-weak-forecast-adi-2011-11-22
 (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal first-quarter 2012 results on February 22, 2012. We witness limited movements in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.Analog's fourth quarter 2011 pro forma earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, or 4.8% due to weaker-than-expected revenue and margins, which in turn impacted earnings.Revenue in the quarter was $716.1 million, down 5.5% sequentially and 7.0% year over year, particularly due to the weakness in the communications and industrial end markets. However, the consumer segment performed well in the quarter on account of seasonal increase in demand for digital cameras, gaming systems and the like. Automotive was also up 11.2% sequentially.Gross margin of 64.3% was down both sequentially and year over year, impacted by an unfavorable mix and lower utilization rates, as Analog cut production to lower both internal and distributor inventories.Analog expects first quarter revenue to decline 5-10% sequentially with the gross margin being 63% (+/- 50 bps), operating expenses of $226-229 million and diluted EPS of 44-51 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 59 cents when the company reported earnings, well over the guided range.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 19 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, one made an upward revision in the last 30 days, while for fiscal 2012, one analyst made a downward revision over the same time period.The majority of analysts expect a decent first quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS (including options) in line with the Street consensus estimates of $662 million and $0.48, respectively. Additionally, they anticipate gross margins in line with management guidance of 63.0% (+/- 50 basis points).The analysts expect to see strength in the automotive end market and stabilization in industrial and communications, which have remained weak thus far, driven by 3G deployments in China. They also contend that increasing semiconductor content in automobiles will drive the company's revenue growth.They also believe that order trends in the analog segment are improving and channel inventory is at a record low level. Hence, they expect to see strong recovery in the second half of 2012 driven by improved demand and inventory restocking.However, a handful of analysts do not expect a strong quarter due to a certain amount of softness in the industrial and communications business and uncertainty in the current environment.In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 11 cents to 48 cents for the first quarter and 37 cents to $2.28 for fiscal 2012.The significant decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the 90-day period was in response to management's comments during the fourth quarter , following which a majority of analysts had lowered estimates.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. We remain encouraged by the company's dominant position in many of its product segments, and meaningfully improved gross and operating margin structures.However, we remain concerned about the tough macroeconomic environment and softness within the communications and industrial infrastructure markets. With customers continuing to cut inventories and typical first quarter seasonality, we do not expect Analog Devices to see a strong first quarter. Also, given that the company expects lower sales during Christmas and the lunar New Year, it will effectively have 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue in the upcoming quarter.Analog, which competes with other large analog players, such as Intersil Corporation,  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), holds a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term 'Sell' rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Earnings Preview: Analog Devices - Analyst Blog@2012-02-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-preview%3A-analog-devices-analyst-blog-2012-02-21
"f history is any guide, we should see market volume begin to taper off the rest of the week as investors take care of last-minute Thanksgiving plans. This trend should carry through to tomorrow's session, as well as Friday's half-day session.Today's early market spike was not able to hold, with sellers making an appearance once again. Earnings results did not help sentiment much, with stocks like Cracker Barrel (  ), Analog Devices (  ), and Campbell Soup (  ) closing lower following their reports. On the flipside, shares of Medtronic (  ) gained on their numbers. Hormel Foods (  ),  . Tech giant Hewlett Packard (  ) managed to close off the lows, but still finished in the red after the company reported results along with a cautious 2012 outlook.As always, you can find our coverage of these latest earnings reports on  .Meanwhile, positive Wall Street commentary helped lift shares of Yum! Brands (  ), while shares of Marriott International (  ) moved lower on negative Wall Street chatter.I was recently reading a story about Foxconn, one of the world's largest tech manufacturers. The company produces plenty of products for major companies such as Apple (  ) and Sony (  ). Foxconn is said to be undergoing a 3-year initiative to replace 500,000 workers in China with industrial robots.This development made me think about what's going on in the job market here in our own country. Corporate America is doing more with less, and scores of Venture Capitalists and Private Equity Investors from Silicon Valley and beyond continue to make it their business to invest in new companies that can shake up many existing industries. Whether we like the shift occurring or not, the wheels have been in motion and will continue to remain so as far as I can tell.If you're still of working age, make it a point to find out everything you can about your particular industry. Keep acquiring new skills that are coming in demand. That'll help you keep as firm a grip as you can on your job.Don't get blindsided by industry trend shifts that can leave you vulnerable as you approach your key earning years!The holiday season begins this week and continues throughout next month. These are fun times where we all catch up with loved ones, and everyone seems to have plenty to say. Whether chatter is about next year's election, the economy, one's career, investment ideas, or business plans, it could pay to have your proverbial earplugs nearby.It will be tempting to hold your relatives accountable for some of their past investing ""ideas"" that didn't pan out so well. I urge you to avoid these kinds of conflicts (your spouse might remind you as well, sometimes with a swift elbow or a kick to the shin under the table).I've always found that watching sports on television during the holidays is the easiest way to avoid some of my relatives' rants, which usually include very little facts to support them. Joking aside, it is actually a great time for me to hear my loved ones' thoughts about the state of their finances. I always like to learn how others (who may not be so market-focused as I am) see things shaping up.Do yourself a favor this holiday season and listen more than you may usually do. Think of it as a focus group in a sense, and you will get even more out of your gathering than you think. Sentiment can be very indicative of how soon the economy can begin to make a turn back up.We know many of you enjoy reading the daily newsletter, but remember that with our  service, the newsletter is just one small component of what we offer.

"(A controversial new piece of legislation is gaining ground in the US Senate and House of Representatives that aims to pressure China into raising the value of their currency. Despite bi-partisan support the bill's momentum may have faltered after it was met with objection from Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner on Tuesday morning.Similar legislation to curtail China's currency undervaluation and competitive edge in the  has floundered in the past. But given the US's 9% unemployment rate and heightened attention to China's competitive stance, this bill has more momentum behind it than the previous attempts.Last year's bill received 99 Republican votes, a stark contrast to the new bill which has received more than 200 House co-sponsors this week. It is expected to quickly reach 218, the number needed to pass, reports .This particular bill calls for U.S tariffs on imports from countries with undervalued currencies, a deliberate nod towards China. Those in favor of the bill argue it will help level the playing field and bring jobs back to America.Critics of the legislation argue that the consequences, if not pure retaliation, from China could be highly detrimental to U.S exports and jobs. ""If enacted, would risk a trade war with China — one of the fastest-growing markets for U.S. goods — at a time when a sputtering global economy can least afford it.""On Tuesday morning Representative Boehner threw in his two cents: ""While I've got concerns about how the Chinese have dealt with their currency, I'm not sure this is the way to fix it,"" he told reporters. According to it's worth reminding ""house speakers normally get their way on legislation.""China, which has an export-based economy and strong interest in keeping their currency as low and competitive as possible, has not been idle in the debate. ""China's central bank and the ministries of commerce and foreign affairs accused Washington of ""politicizing"" currency issues and putting the global economy at risk of a trade war…China says it is committed to gradual currency reform and notes that the yuan has risen 30 percent against the dollar since 2005."" (via Reuters)If Obama passes the bill into law, China's economy would very likely suffer from a decrease in exports as the United States shifts suppliers.

"f you've ever invested in semiconductor and semiconductor-equipment stocks, then you've seen the dramatic ups and downs these  can take. To make money with these chip stocks, you have to figure out the right time to buy (ahead of the next peak of the chip-spending cycle), and you need to cash-out before the cycle swings back down.But because this is not always easy to identify, perhaps a saner approach is to focus on chip stocks that aren't quite as cyclical. I'm talking about chip makers that focus on the world outside of computers and telecom equipment, and instead target automobiles, industrial process-control systems, security networks and the like.The time to look at these stocks has never been better. First, because an increasing number of items are being developed with chips embedded in them. Second, stock prices for the key players have rarely been this cheap.Domestic appliances, lighting systems, clean-energy technologies and a range of other products are all getting ""chip savvy."" Let's take the automobile industry as an example. Today's cars already have vastly more computing power than 20 years ago. Airbags come with sensors, windshields can automatically detect raindrops, car stereos can adjust the  when external noise intrudes in the interior, and phone calls can be routed through car speakers, for example. And chips make all of this possible.In the years ahead, even more automotive technology will find a home in mainstream cars. We're just now seeing the adoption of cars that know to stay within a traffic lane, keep their distance from other cars, automatically stop when a pedestrian moves into traffic, toggle power between electric motors and traditional engines, and even anticipate an engine breakdown before it even occurs. This is going to be a real boon to the chip makers that supply the auto industry. And this is only the technology we know about right now. Extrapolate this trend into other industries such as domestic appliances or home energy systems, and you may get a sense the chip industry is in the midst of a mini-revolution.And in this mini-revolution, three companies stand to benefit the most. They may not be as well-known as chip giants like Intel (Nasdaq:  ), but their growth prospects are arguably even brighter. Here they are...This company makes chips that go into cars, communications equipment and industrial equipment. It stands out as a top-industry performer. Heavy investments in research and development (R&D) (about $500 million a year), coupled with successful lean manufacturing processes have helped the company generate strong and rising margins. As a result, gross margins, which typically averaged about 60%, hit 67.2% in the fiscal third quarter (ended July) -- a company record.The gross-margin strength is quickly turning into operating-margin strength. In the last industry cycle, Analog Devices generated 20% to 25% operating margins, but the metric could exceed 37% in the current  . These  gains -- and the cash they produce -- are helping management to shrink the share count. Analog Devices has bought back 25% of its stock in the past five years, and another buyback plan is currently underway.As a final thought, shares have traded between 11 and 34 times  in the past five years. Thanks to the current selloff, shares now trade for just 13 times projected fiscal (October) 2012 profits, which is near the bottom of that five-year range.This Netherlands-based company is the former chip division of electronics giant Phillips Electronics. NXP is a leading provider of mixed-signal (analog/digital) chips, which combine the ability to read a signal's strength (such as voltage), and determine whether the voltage is flowing or stopped (digital). Profit margins have been in line with the industry peer group (40% gross margins, 10% operating margins), but management is taking action to boost these figures by closing high-cost plants and increasing the amount of work that's outsourced to contract manufacturers.This is all part of  Rick Clemmer's  plan. He joined the company in 2009 as a turnaround specialist after fixing integrated circuit component company Agere Systems and selling it for $4 billion to  in 2007.NXP Semiconductors was taken private in 2006 by Bain Capital, but it went public again in August 2010 at an  price of $13 a share. By last winter, shares had already moved up to above $30, showing signs the stock had become a hotIPO . Almost a year later, it is now back down to roughly $17.Investors are likely a bit spooked that the company's $4.5 billion  could prove troublesome if the  really hits the skids. Cleamer says he intends to aggressively pay down a large part of this debt from the company's  during the next few years, which should help move the price to  (P/E) multiple back in line with industry peers (it currently stands at 7.9). Analysts at Sterne Agee figure margin gains and debt reductions could push the stock up roughly 70% to $29 within one year, or about 10.5 times their projected 2012  forecasts.This could be a great investment story for 2012 and 2013, since 2011 has proven to be year of growing pains. The company acquired a large mixed-signal chip division from Japanese electronics maker Sanyo last winter, but various crises in Asia have slowed down integration plans. Adding insult: recent flooding in Thailand has led to the temporary closure of a facility there as well.Needless to say, the next quarter or two could still be messy, but the long-term outlook is quite bright for this chip maker. ON Semiconductor expects to boost margins at the acquired Sanyo facilities through various streamlining initiatives, so it should be posting better numbers in 2012 and beyond. Earnings per shares (  ) is likely to grow from just under $1 this year to about $1.10, and then really surge to $1.30 in 2013, as all of the current turnaround steps get traction. Shares trade for just six times this view, and as the multiple expands, Citigroup predicts shares could rise from a current $8 to $17, while analysts at D.A. Davidson carry a $15  .Risks to Consider:  In volatile times like this, it pays to focus on more consistent business models. Analog Devices has become the industry's leader in terms of cutting-edge products and strong profit margins. NXP Semiconductors is shaping up to be a solid debt deleveraging story and, as its  strengthens, the subpar earnings multiple is likely to expand and send the stock higher. ON Semiconductor has been quite noisy with its Asia-related challenges, but as the company overcomes them in 2012 and beyond, investors will find a very healthy -- and profitable -- company.Investing in chip stocks can be tricky, but with these three stable stocks, investors will have their money in a place with enough downside protection and solid growth potential.-- David StermanDisclosure: Neither David Sterman nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Steady Chip Stocks for a Volatile Sector@2011-10-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-steady-chip-stocks-volatile-sector-2011-10-19
 ' (  ) fiscal first quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Revenue missed the consensus by 2.1%. All except the automotive end market weakened for the company, although consumer was the weakest of all. Shares slumped 2.56% in response.While the guidance was also below our expectations, the comentary was more or less as we had expected going by earnings reports from other analog players, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Analog Devices generated revenue of $648.1 million, which was down 9.5% sequentially, 11.0% year over year and just within management's revenue guidance of $645-680 million (down 5-10% sequentially, down 7-12% year over year).Analog Devices had previously cautioned about a weak first quarter, due to inventory reduction at customers and lack of sales during Christmas and the lunar new year, which would effectively result in 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue.The  market generated 45% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 7.9% sequentially and 14.6% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.The sequential decline in the last quarter was driven by broad-based declines across customers, markets and geographies. ADI stated that the increased caution at customers due to economic concerns led them to further reduce inventories, although order rates indicated that sentiments were improving. generated 19% of total revenue, down 13.0% sequentially and 17.7% year over year. Analog Devices' communications business now constitutes infrastructure sales alone. Management stated that this business was impacted by general economic uncertainty, regulatory issues in some countries and disruptions caused by the  (  ) and T Mobile merger failing. , which now includes the computing (1% of fiscal 2011 revenue) and handset (3% of fiscal 2011 revenue) businesses, generated 18% of revenue, down 21.4% sequentially and down 19.9% from a year ago. The greater-than-expected sequential decline was attributed to the flooding in Thailand that impacted production at customers, which impacted demand.The  segment generated around 18% of Analog Devices' first quarter revenue, increasing 5.9% sequentially and 25.9% from the year-ago quarter. The growing electronic content in automobiles, growing dollar content per vehicle for Analog and increased sales of vehicles helped sales in the last quarter.The revenue decline was across all analog and power management products, although digital signal processing (DSP) increased slightly.ADI signal processing products (84% of total revenue) were down 10.1% sequentially and 11.8% year over year. All product lines within analog (converters, amplifiers and other analog products) contributed to the sequential decline, with converters declining the most, followed by amplifiers and then other analog products.Specifically, converters were down 11.8% sequentially and 13.5% year over year. Amplifiers followed, with sequential and year-over-year declines of 10.0% and 15.9%, respectivey. Other analog products saw a relatively smaller decline of 4.8% from the previous quarter and an increase of 2.6% from a year ago. The three product lines generated 44%, 25% and 15% of quarterly revenue, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenue, down 15.6% and 15.9%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters. These products are generally sold into the consumer market that has been impacted by the Thailand flooding and resultant disruption in the supply chain. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to increase focus on this fast-growing product line.DSPs (9% of total revenue) were up 2.8% sequentially and 2.5% year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 63.2%, down 113 basis points (bps) sequentially, 301 bps year over year and in line with management's guidance of 63% (+/- 50 bps). Gross margins were impacted by lower utilization rates (below 70% in the last quarter from 73%), as Analog tried to keep internal inventories under control.Operating expenses of $226.0 million were flattish sequentially and up 1.5% from the January quarter of 2010. As a result, the operating margin shrunk 456 bps sequentially and 731 bps year over year to 28.3%.On a sequential basis, R&D increased the most as a percentage of sales, with SG&A and cost of sales also increasing. As may be expected, all expenses also grew year over year as a percentage of sales.The pro forma net income was $139.4 million, or a 21.5% net income margin compared to $183.5 million, or 25.6% in the previous quarter and $203.8 million, or a 28.0% net income margin in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 46 cents compared to 60 cents in the previous quarter and 66 cents in the January quarter of last year.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same.Inventories increased 0.7% to $297.2 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping sequentially from 3.5X to 3.2X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went down to 43 from 44. Cash generated from operations was around $214.8 million. Analog Devices spent $25.3 million on capex, $74.4 million on cash dividends and $78.4 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.Given improving order trends through January and February, ADI expects industrial revenue to increase in the next quarter. The consumer business is expected to increase slightly in line with normal seasonality. The momentum in the autootive business is also ikely to be sustained. However, will likely remain weak for one more quarter and recover thereafter (going by customer feedback).Management expects second quarter revenue of $655-$675 million (a 1-4% sequential increase) with the gross margin at 64-64.5%, operating expenses of around $226 million and diluted EPS of 48-53 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 54 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, just over the guided range.Analog Devices had another bad quarter, impacted by economic concerns and caution at customers. However, if management commentary is to be believed, order trends have already started improving, with both January and February coming in notably stronger. As a result, management now expects the first quarter to be the trough for orders, revenue and margins.Despite the positive commentary, we note that guidance remains below our expectations for the next quarter. We think this is likely to trigger downward revision to estimates, containing price appreciation and keeping the Zacks Rank at #4 (short-term Sell rating). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices Optimistic Despite Miss - Analyst Blog@2012-02-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-optimistic-despite-miss-analyst-blog-2012-02-23

"he brutal market swoon has reminded us of an oft-repeated lesson: even the best companies can get swept up in a downdraft. This across-the-board selling, frequently the result of an economic slowdown, can end up revealing a clear chasm. On the one side are companies that would indeed run into trouble if sales fell and financial resources grew limited. On the other side of the ledger are companies that are so strong, so flush with cash, that even another dip back to  couldn't derail them. But because investors are also indiscriminately shedding these stocks, they're presenting clear and compelling ""buy"" signals.I've come across 12 stocks that simply can't be ignored. They're sitting on huge piles of net cash, while being prodigious producers of  . The market sell-off positions these companies to put their cash and  to use. Whether it's deal-making, stock buybacks,  hikes or simply investments in their business to pursue long-term growth, these companies can step on the gas while many others would need to retreat in an economic downturn.-- David StermanYou'll recognize some of these names from my recent articles. For example, I recently suggestedshares of  looked quite compelling and, though they have moved up more than 10% since then, they still look far too cheap by a variety of measures.I also wrote about  in August and noted the company has deployed its strong  on extensive research and development (R&D) spending, which has led to a great  performance. I still like Micron and Analog Devices a lot.It's no surprise to see the big tech firms with very high cash levels. Firms such as  ,  ,  and  have always been highly debt-averse. They build cash hoards for a ""rainy day,"" but their rising cash levels are reaching levels for far beyond any conceivable rainy day. The high-cash level is partially attributable to tax exposure of foreign profits when they are repatriated, though currently contemplated legislation could lower the tax rate, setting the stage for a return of this cash to the United States.But one company is not historically seen as a balance-sheet powerhouse, but has now come to dominate such cash-focused stock screens. I'm talking about  , which rallied after its late 2010  at $35 a share to almost $39, but has plunged since then and is now trading at about $22.70.How deeply has GM fallen? The automaker carries more than $30 billion in net cash, not far from its entire stock  . It's as if investors were saying the company's auto business is worth almost nothing. This is a company that still had $136 billion in sales in 2010 (down from $180 billion in 2007). Remarkably, GM was able to generate  of about $16.5 billion in 2010, which was 25% higher than the 2007 levels. So sure sales have fallen, but costs have fallen even more.Yet the current economic slowdown has led investors to again fear a 2008-style meltdown, which as you probably know, didn't play out so well for GM back then. Yet the eventual bankruptcy and IPO of GM created a new company with a sterling balance sheet. Right now, analysts expect GM to earn nearly $6 billion (or $4 a share) in 2011 and a similar amount in 2012. Let's assume analysts are too optimistic and GM fails to make this money because the possible looming economic recession may take a big bite out of sales. Simply put, this company is not poised for trouble even if it doesn't make any money in 2012. It's only a matter of time, perhaps 2013 or 2014, when business fully rebounds and GM starts making more than $5 billion a year.Make no mistake, real challenges have emerged for GM since the well-received IPO of last fall. It has become apparent the product-development process slowed to crawl during the financial difficulties of 2008 and 2009. So GM is only now making a big R&D push, which won'tbear tangible fruit for another 12-24 months. In addition, after a steady brain drain, the company's management team has not been as impressive as the managers running Ford. GM has more work to do to build a top-notch team that really knows the auto business. Lastly, GM's highly-profitable pick-up truck business doesn't look so good right now, since the housing market is still on the ropes, leaving the hundreds of thousands of contractors employed by the construction industry with little reason to buy new trucks right now.These challenges shouldn't be overstated, however, and there's little reason why GM should be valued at almost nothing, which is the case when you back out all that cash. When investors eventually look past the near-term economic headwinds, they'll notice GM is one of the cheapest stocks on the market.Risks to consider:  In this unsteady it market, it pays to play defense. Focusing on companies with very strong balance sheets can provide investors with upside exposure in any market rally and downside protection in any further market weakness. As market-timing is nearly impossible, investors have a rare chance to buy these balance-sheet kings while they remain so cheap.Disclosure: Neither David Sterman nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Stocks with Bullet-Proof Balance Sheets@2011-09-20@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-bullet-proof-balance-sheets-2011-09-20

"Shutterstock photoInvestors are pressing the ""Sell"" button as fast as they can, dumping stocks that have already fallen 20% or 30% on fears they'll fall even more in the sessions to come. The current environment appears based on fear more than fact.Indeed, the  was merrily loping along toward the 13,000 mark just a few weeks ago, just as  got underway. Since then, most companies have delivered quarterly results that could best be characterized as ""decent"" to ""excellent."" Yet the Dow has been in utter freefall, moving below 12,500 on July 27 and below 12,000 on Aug. 2. Just a few sessions later, the Dow is now below 11,500, putting us right back where we were at the start of the year.Is it time to throw in the towel and save your funds for sunnier times? No way. In fact, history has shown that you really make money in stocks when you steadily sell into a rising market and steadily buy into a slumping market. It takes a lot of intestinal fortitude to ""zig"" when others ""zag,"" but this is how the most successful investors, people like Warren Buffett and George Soros, made their fortunes. [See: ""  "" from InvestingAnswers.com]For active investors, this recent selloff is quite disturbing. We're less than three years removed from the last market plunge, and many hoped such a traumatic event would only come along once every decade or two. Right about now, many are wondering if we should brace for another 2008/2009-style meltdown. After all, the downdraft that started in the summer of 2008 would continue for more than six months and the market only found a floor in March 2009.Yet in many respects, the current selloff has little to do with the drop from three years ago. Back then, companies suddenly found themselves without access to credit as the financial system seized up, a wide range of firms carried staggering amounts of debt that they took on during headier times, and consumer spending virtually evaporated.Recent economic data are pretty sobering as theeconomy looks to be headed for zero or even negative growth. But companies are so much stronger now, with leaner cost structures, far less debt and recordprofit margins. Consumers are cautious and spendthrift, but not hiding in closets as they were back in 2008. If 2008 felt like Armageddon, 2011 simply feels like a more run-of-the-mill economic slowdown. Make no mistake: it's bleak out there. But a host of positives are also in place, led by corporate profits, the health of the banking system, rising exports (thanks to a weak dollar) and still-low interest rates.As this market meltdown is of a different stripe than the market plunge of 2008/2009, then so is the game plan. What worked then won't work now, and vice versa. In the fall of 2008, investors with strong stomachs greatly profited from the ""bankruptcy"" trade.  of  ,  and  all fell below $3. Sure these companies were carrying heavy debt loads, but savvy investors did the math and saw bankruptcy wasn't a likely outcome. As a result, each stock offered once-in-a-generation bargains. Each stock would eventually move back up into the teens -- or higher, and investors walked away with gains of 200%, 300% or even 500%.There's a simple reason why we won't be revisiting those scary depths: corporate balance sheets are much stronger than before. Ford, for example, now has $8 billion in net cash and, even in a still-weak  , should see this figure rise to more than $20 billion by the end of 2013, according to analysts in the auto industry.This isn't to suggest that a wide range of companies are set to imminently deliver major gains. Indeed, it now appears as ifprofit forecasts for many stocks in 2012 will need to come down. The  pullback likely accounts for much of that downward revision yet to come.So whereas the theme of late 2008 was ""buy the stocks that people erroneously think are going bankrupt,"" now the theme is ""buy great companies that have loads of cash, steady  and can be had for single-digit forward multiples."" Profits may weaken in 2012, pushing those forward multiples from the high-single digits into the low teens, but we're talking about recession-era profits. Long-term investors don't tend to focus on what ""trough""  look like, they look to see what the company's profits can look like when the economic picture brightens.Let's use Ford as an example. The auto maker's stock trades for six times projected 2011 and 2012  of about $2. Let's assume business slumps in 2012 and per-share profits fall to $1.50. Well, shares are trading at about eight times this downbeat view. Now let's think about what Ford can earn when the economy turns up. $3 a share? $4 a share? With a stock trading under $12, that's simply too cheap to ignore.In recent weeks, I've been looking at a number of solid blue-chip plays that look increasingly attractive with each passing day. Yes, shares are lower than they were a few weeks ago. But for intrepid investors, this simply makes them more attractive for investors with a long-term view.As an example, I profiled financially robust  earlier this week that now sport very low valuations in relation to their earnings and  margins. [  .]As a specific example in that analysis, I took a deep look at chip maker  . Back in the spring, I marveled at how the company was in the midst of a very nice upturn in business that was yielding steady  gains and outsized profits. But recommending a stock that had run from $28 last September to above $40 in the spring is just not my style. I don't ""hate 'em when they're loved,"" but I do ""love 'em when they're hated."" And right now, shares of this chip maker are in utter freefall, falling below $40 in early July, below $35 in late July, and seemingly headed for $30.What will Analog Devices have to say on August 16 when quarterly results roll in? I don't know. But I do know the company is using its strong  for a stock buyback program, and any near-term pressure resulting from a cautious management tone simply means the company will be able to buy back even more stock with its available funds. I also know that thanks to heavy research and development spending, Analog Devices has a very fresh product line yielding  gains and rising profit margins. Business may not be great in 2012, but I've got a strong sense Analog Devices will be a proven winner in the long term.This logic extends to other solid companies that I've recently profiled. Companies that generate lots of cash when business is lousy can presumably really fatten the balance sheet when business trends improve. This was my take on  , which  .In a similar vein,  the management team at  was doing well by sharply cutting expenses in this era of economic uncertainty, holding off on any major investments to focus on continued  generation. The airline industry is a notoriusly bad place to be when the economy slows, which is why shares are falling sharply. ButDelta 's management team is rewriting this history with a much wiser approach to cash management. Might the airline industry weaken in 2012? Sure, but  's weaker rivals are likely to feel much greater pain, cutting back in places that allow Delta to seize the advantage. The plunging market signals the time to step up your research. Ideas can be found among companies with strong insider buying, bulletproof balance sheets, high and sustainabledividend yields, expanding international sales, etc. The list of potential positives simply can't be ignored.To be sure, you want to stress test any stock to see if the company can handle a reasonable drop in sales in 2012 and 2013 and still emerge with its balance sheet intact and profits in the black. The fact many of them now trade at fresh lows sets up an important entry point. These stocks may fall even further in coming weeks, but since it's hard to time a market bottom, the long-term view should now be dictating your thinking.-- David StermanDisclosure: Neither David Sterman nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@With the Market in Chaos, What Should Investors do Now?@2011-08-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/market-chaos-what-should-investors-do-now-2011-08-04
"Many seem to be concerned over the slowdown occurring in China. The slowdown is result of the government’s concerted effort to rein in inflation and thereby cooling economic growth.Data released Thursday shows that the government policies could be taking effect.The HSBC PMI, an index tracking Chinese managers’ factory orders fell to 48.9% in July, reports . The index is a measure, from zero to 100, of the percentage of purchasing managers expecting to increase orders. Values lower than 50 suggest contraction.The PMI data signals the first contraction in the Chinese manufacturing sector in a year. The sector comprises forty percent of GDP, write Kevin Yao and Emily Kaiser of .Of course, a slowdown in China is much more like slowing from a run to jog than slowing to the snail’s pace that the US is experiencing. The Chinese economy is expected to expand by over 9% this year (via ).""The slowdown at the moment is policy induced. There is an awful lot of easy growth to come,"" Stephen Green of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters.Economic data this year has not led to a consensus regarding China. According to Yao and Kaiser, the IMF released two reports this year. One supports the government slowdown policies that they expect will decrease inflationary pressures and a possible property bubble.The other report describes the concerns of China’s trading partners regarding a possible economic “hard landing,” citing the possibly unsustainable double-digit annual GDP growth China experienced last decade. In particular, they are worried that government policies have led to overinvestment, which creates excess capacity (ie, too many expensive roads and not enough cars to drive on them).Caterpillar, the construction equipment , recently announced their bullish outlook on the Chinese economy, which they hope will help boost its earnings.“In our view, China is doing a good job of balancing growth and inflation, and our expectations for China remain positive.” (via )Interested in the Chinese economy?

"Shutterstock photoThe U.S.economy sure looks dicey. This week's trading kicked off with news that the Institute of Supply Management's (  )index of manufacturing activity came in well short of forecasts -- just another sign the  has slowed. You may think it's yet another reason to avoid stocks and park your cash under a mattress. But by doing so, you may overlook another feature of the . By one key measure, stocks are absurdly cheap, helping the market to flash a ""buy"" signal.That measure? It's the ratio between corporateprofit margins and price-to-earnings (  ) ratios. Over the decades, investors have been willing to pay a premium for stocks that deliver impressive  gains. Not right now. In some instances, a company's operating margins are many times higher than the stock's forward P/E ratio, which is a relatively rare event. As an example, chip-making behemoth  generated 35% operating margins in 2010 -- a company record, yetshares trade for just 9.4 times projected 2011 profits.To be sure, there are other variables investors consider, such as  strength. And investors are more concerned with sales growth and further margin gains, preferring to look ahead and not behind. Yet it's undeniable that  margins are the clearest measure of the health of a business, and P/E ratios are the most typical gauge of a business' value. With that in mind, I went screening for companies with operating margins that are high and getting higher (as measured by expected 2011 profit growth of at least 15%), yet trade for less than 11 times projected 2011 profits.In the table below, you'll note the ""Magic 20."" Each of these S&P 500 components have operating margins at least 50% higher than their forward P/E ratio. These are ""buy-and-hold"" names because they may continue to languish if the economy stalls in the near-term, but should be rally leaders when the market is back on its feet.-- David StermanIt's no coincidence there are many tech stocks on the list. Industry leaders such as  , Applied Materials (Nasdaq:  ) and Intel are doing just OK in 2011, thanks in large part to economy-related headwinds. But those with a long-term view will likely benefit from these  when investors return to tech stocks. And their super-strong balance sheets are to be considered a key weapon in these challenging times.Another tech name to watch: chip maker  , which has seen its shares fall 20% since mid-May. Back then, ADI delivered a better-than-expected fiscal second quarter and raised full-year guidance. The upside is the result of steady research and development spending (at around $500 million per year) that helps freshen the product line-up of chips that go into cars, communications equipment and industrial equipment. The net result: gross margins of 67.6% in the second quarter, a company record.Thegross margin strength is quickly turning intooperating margin strength. In the last cycle, ADI typically generated 20% to 25% operating margins, but the metric should exceed 37% in the currentfiscal year . Those margin gains, and the cash they produce, is helping management to shrink the share count. ADI has bought back 25% of its stock in the past five years, and another buyback is currently underway. As a final thought, shares have traded between 11 and 34 times  in the past five years. Thanks to the current sell-off, shares now trade for just 11 times projected fiscal (October) 2012 profits, which is at the bottom of that five-year range.I wrote about this tax prep firm  , and shares subsequently rallied 40% in the spring toward the $18 mark. Those gains have largely evaporated, and H&R Block is once again a deep value play -- with impressive operating margins to boot.As is the case with Analog Devices, the downdraft in shares actually took place even as H&R Block was delivering solid financial results. Thanks to favorable comparisons with a very weak fiscal (April) 2010, H&R Block boosted per share profits more than 20% in fiscal 2011, to $1.63. Per share profits in the current year are likely to grow more modestly, perhaps about 10%, as high unemployment levels continue to pressure the tax prep business.To be sure, H&R Block stumbled badly in the last decade as management made ill-fated forays intomortgage lending and other non-core areas. New CEO Bill Cobb, who took the company's reins in early May, has laid out a much more grounded growth strategy, predicated on moves to buildmarket share in the retail store business, the digitally downloaded software segment and the nascent international tax business efforts.Even before those moves, H&R Block was a  , generating more than $400 million in  in fiscal 2011. This helps to support a solid  (currently yielding 4%), a steady drawdown in debt, and share buybacks. The company bought back 24 million shares in fiscal 2011 (shrinking the share count by 7%) and expects to continue doing so. You can't blame management for that choice. Shares trade for just four times trailing  , and 10 times trailing free cash flow. A tough economy surely calls for a cautious stance. But many stocks are verifiable bargains, sporting peak margins and robust profits. The broader market weakness has punished stocks like Analog Devices and H&R Block, but that simply opens the door for far-sighted value investors who could see a big payoff down the line.P.S. -- Few investors realize that a 20-year energy agreement between the United States and Russia is about to expire. This deal supplies 10% of America's electricity. As broke as our government is, the situation is so serious that President Obama is asking for $36 billion to avert this crisis.

 ' (  ) fiscal fourth quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, or 4.8%. Revenue missed the consensus by 8.2%. Particular weakness in the communications and industrial markets led to weaker-than-expected revenue. This, in turn, impacted margins.The guidance was also below our expectations, but the market appears to have priced in the weakness, given that other analog players, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) also guided below expectations. Therefore, shares did not lose much in after-market trade.Analog Devices generated revenue of $716.1 million, which was down 5.5% sequentially, 7.0% year over year and just within management's revenue guidance of $715-755 million (down 0-6% sequentially, down 2-7% year over year).While the industrial segment weakened in line with management guidance, Analog Devices had guided to strength in communications infrastructure that did not materialize.The  market generated 41% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 13.9% sequentially and 10.0% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.The sequential decline in the last quarter was on account of increased caution at customers, as economic concerns led them to further reduce inventories. Management stated that the weakness was broad-based across product lines and geographies. Order flow started to stabilize through October and November. Analog Devices' full-year performance was good, however, due to strong revenue growth in industrial automation, instrumentation and energy markets. , which now includes the computing (1% of fiscal 2011 revenue) and handset (3% of fiscal 2011 revenue) businesses, generated 21% of revenue, up 7.9% sequentially and down 9.3% from a year ago. The sequential increase was on account of seasonal increase in demand for digital cameras, gaming systems and the like. Sales for the year were down, as Analog Devices shifted focus to higher value-added applications that are likely to generate better margins. generated 19% of total revenue, down 9.2% sequentially and 14.1% year over year. Analog Devices' communications business comes from both infrastructure and cell phones, although the focus is on the infrastructure side. However, management is now including phones in the consumer segment.Although revenue in the quarter benefited from the recovery in Japan, this was more than offset by the postponement of the build-out in China and overall inventory reduction across the world due to increased macro concerns. The mobile data segment drove revenue for the year.The  segment generated around 16% of Analog Devices' fourth quarter revenue, increasing 11.2% sequentially and 20.2% from the year-ago quarter. Growing electronic content in automobiles and strong position at customers offset macro pressures to generate the growth in the last quarter.The global recovery, better credit availability, as well as increasing electronic content per vehicle, especially in the areas of infotainment, safety and fuel efficiency remain long-term drivers. This, along with increasing demand for high-end vehicles that use Analog Devices products are positives for the company.The revenue decline was across all product lines, including analog, power management and digital signal processing (DSP).Analog signal processing products (85% of total revenue) were down 5.3% sequentially and 6.7% year over year. All product lines within analog (converters, amplifiers and other analog products) contributed to the sequential decline, although other analog products were up year over year.Converters remained the largest product line for Analog Devices, with a revenue share of over 45%. Amplifiers followed, with a 26% revenue share, while other analog products accounted for 14% of total revenue.Power management and reference products remained at 7% of revenue, down 3.3% sequentially and 4.5% from last year. The strength in this product line is the result of management's refocusing of the business over the last few years.DSPs (8% of total revenue) were down 9.3% sequentially and 12.3% year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 64.3%, down 294 basis points (bps) sequentially, 274 bps year over year and missing management's guidance of 65-66%. Gross margins were impacted by a negative mix (more automotive and consumer versus less industrial and communications) and utilization rates dropping (from 78% to 73%), as Analog cut production to lower both internal and distributor inventories.Operating expenses of $225.2 million were down 2.4% sequentially and 2.3% from the October quarter of 2010, much less than the overall decline in revenue. As a result, the operating margin shrunk 394 bps sequentially and 425 bps year over year to 32.9%.On a sequential basis, cost of sales increased the most as a percentage of sales, with R&D and SG&A increasing at more or less the same rate. All expenses grew year-over-year as a percentage of sales.The pro forma net income was $183.5 million, or a 25.6% net income margin compared to $219.9 million, or 29.0% in the previous quarter and $225.0 million, or a 29.2% net income margin in the prior-year quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 60 cents compared to 71 cents in the previous quarter and 73 cents in the October quarter of last year. The EPS was well below management's expectations of 74 cents.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same.Inventories dropped 1.4% to $295.1 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping flat sequentially at 3.5X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went down to 44 from 45. Cash generated from operations was around $230.2 million. Analog Devices spent $26.3 million on capex, $74.8 million on cash dividends and $82.8 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.With customers continuing to cut inventories and typical first quarter seasonality, Analog Devices will see a weak first quarter. Also, given that the company does not expect to generate any sales during Christmas and the lunar new year, it will effectively have 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue.Given this backdrop, revenue for the quarter is expected to decline 5-10% sequentially with the gross margin at 63% (+/- 50 bps), operating expenses of $226-229 million and diluted EPS of 44-51 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 59 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, well over the guided range.Analog Devices has not had a good quarter, which is not surprising for an analog company in the current environment. However, the thing that concerns us is the areas in which it is seeing weakness. A certain amount of softness in the industrial business may be considered normal for the December quarter, but we are talking about much more than seasonality here. Both the industrial and communications businesses were impacted by economic concerns and increased caution at customers.We are however encouraged by expectations that these businesses are likely to pick up strongly in 2012. We believe that the company has an attractive portfolio and strong position at customers that would respond quickly to a pickup in demand. In the meantime, cost containment is likely to be a key theme for maximizing earnings.Analog Devices shares carry a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short term Hold recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Analog Devices Misses Again - Analyst Blog@2011-11-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analog-devices-misses-again-analyst-blog-2011-11-22
"he market could not pony up enough buying today as earnings season got under way and talk of potential further easing from the Federal Reserve pushed investors back to the sidelines.Alcoa (  ), usually the first company in the Dow to report, kicked off earnings season with mixed results. The stock is basically unchanged at the moment. The tech sector was a dark cloud throughout the session as earnings warnings from Microchip Technology (  ) and Novellus Systems (  ) dragged shares lower. The selling spread to other well-known tech plays in the semiconductor/wireless space, including Texas Instruments (  ), Analog Devices (  ), and Qualcomm (  ). There were some buyers putting some money to work in the gold mining space as gold prices rallied on further talk of quantitative easing. Goldcorp (  ) and Agnico-Eagle Mines (  ) led the way higher.As the government tries to avoid an unlikely debt default by month's end, there are several proposals on the table that could put another dent in people's retirement outlook, especially when it comes to Social Security benefits. The latest target is the current measure used to determine consumer price changes for current benefit calculations. I have always been skeptical of how the traditional CPI (Consumer Price Index) is calculated. For years it has appeared to fall heavily in favor of the government, which currently claims that the true cost of living expense increases are negligible. We all know that is a bunch of hogwash. The latest ploy to combat inflation claims is being called the ""Chained"" Consumer Price Index.What does this made-up statistic mean exactly? The easiest way to explain it is to relate the metric to the price of red meat. Traditionally, CPI was calculated by taking the average cost of red meat one year and measuring it against the cost one year later. Simple, right? Effective? Absolutely. Now let's look at the new method. The ""Chained"" CPI assumes that when the price of red meat goes up, people will simply buy lower-quality cuts of meat (which are, of course, lower-priced). Thus, consumers aren't suffering any ill effects of higher prices at all!Anyone with half a brain can clearly see these new cost measurement metrics are pure nonsense. The government wants us to believe that when the cost of necessities go up, people's costs don't actually go up?We all know the struggles regarding Medicare & Social Security in their present forms. There are still too many individuals who are ill-prepared for the later years. It gets even worse when you hear recent survey results that say three out of four people will file to claim Social Security benefits as soon as they're eligible at age 62. Taking benefits as soon as possible at age 62 locks in payments that are only 75 percent of what they would be at age 66, which is defined as the full retirement age for the current wave of retirees. Delaying benefits at age 66 will raise them by 8 percent a year until age 70, after which benefits do not increase with age. The solution isn't to worry yourself sick about it, but instead start to take action. Start cutting your debt immediately, especially high interest debt (credit cards, etc.). Keep your living expenses in line so you can free up money every month that can be invested into assets that produce income. You need to get the power of compound interest in place to begin generating long-term wealth.Dividend investing allows an investor the opportunity to put compound interest to work for them and it's never too early or too late to become a dividend investor. The key is once you start, you need to stay consistent and make money available to go to work for you. That's it. Don't count on the government or your employer to set you up for a remarkable retirement. Take control and do your own research and create one for yourself. It's great to hear from subscribers that have said they are seeing superb results, and for the first time feel like they have an actual game plan for building and maintaining their wealth. The best thing we can do as individual investors is look for opportunities where we receive great income (dividends) from the companies who can best weather the economic storms ahead. You can count on Dividend.com to be your guide in that arena. As always, you can find all of our current recommendations on our industry-leading  .Our main focus is on quality dividend names with attractive yields, and this should be the focus for all those that are hoping to build income for the long-term. We will continue to parse through our data to make sure only the names we like best remain on our recommended list. Remember, if we downgrade stocks from the list, it is not a sell call! Only in very rare instances will we advocate liquidating positions in a formerly recommended name. We just want to have the best names from a risk/reward standpoint on our recommended list for new money at all times.

"emiconductor makers Texas Instruments Incorporated (  ) and Analog Devices, Inc.

Shutterstock photoThe Dow notched its third straight victory on Monday, as M&A mania swept the Street. However, as we've seen in recent weeks, the bulls shouldn't get too comfortable in the driver's seat, as the market has been prone to sharp upswings and downswings from day to day. That being said, futures on all three major indexes are pointing lower this morning, as downbeat data from Germany has taken the wind out of the bulls' sails. Specifically, it was reported that Germany's economy expanded just 0.1% in the second quarter from the preceding three months -- a discouraging reversal from the 1.3% growth posted in the first quarter. This news has simply bolstered fears of a global economic downturn, with futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) pointing to a starkly lower open. However, a duo of upbeat reports from retail titans Wal-Mart Stores (WMT - 49.98) and The Home Depot (HD - 31.46) may help boost sentiment, as could today's reports on housing and industrial production.In earnings news, retail heavyweight WMT reported that its second-quarter net income climbed to $3.8 billion from $3.6 billion, with earnings coming in at $1.09 per share. Meanwhile, net sales jumped 5.5% to $108.64 billion, while net revenue rose 5.4% to $109.37 billion. Analysts had predicted WMT to post a slightly slimmer profit of $1.08 per share on $108.1 billion of revenue. Wal-Mart's U.S. comparable-store sales fell 0.9%, marking the ninth straight quarterly decline, as consumers have tightened their belts as a result of the still-struggling economy. However, it seems traders have taken a glass-half-full approach to the report, with WMT up 2% ahead of the open.HD said its second-quarter net income rose 14% as a result of higher net sales and comparable-store sales. For the quarter, HD reported a profit of $1.36 billion, up from $1.19 billion in the year-earlier period, while earnings jumped to 86 cents per share. Meanwhile, revenue arrived at $20.23 billion. Analysts had predicted HD to post a profit of 83 cents per share on revenue of $19.97 billion. What's more, the home improvement retailer also upped its outlook for the year, saying it now expects a profit of $2.34 per share; analysts had forecast slimmer fiscal-year earnings of $2.30 per share.Agilent Technologies (A - 37.50) reported a fiscal third-quarter profit of $330 million, or 92 cents per share, up 61% from its year-ago earnings of $205 million, or 58 cents per share. Excluding items, Agilent earned 77 cents per share, while revenue climbed 22% to $1.69 billion. The results topped analysts' expectations for a profit of 73 cents per share on $1.66 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, the company raised its full-year forecast, with Agilent now predicting adjusted earnings of $2.90 to $2.92 per share on revenue of $6.64 billion to $6.66 billion. For comparison, Wall Street's consensus estimates are calling for a fiscal 2011 profit of $2.88 per share on $6.62 billion in revenue.Urban Outfitters (URBN - 29.69) confessed that its second-quarter profit fell 21% to $56.7 million, or 35 cents per share, even as revenue improved 10% to $609.2 million. Gross margin for the quarter contracted to 37.9% from 42.5%, due to deeper discounts at its Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters chains. However, the results actually topped analysts' expectations, with Wall Street looking for a profit of just 32 cents per share on $604 million in revenue.Today's earnings docket will feature reports from Saks (  ), Dick's Sporting Goods (  ), TJX Companies (  ), Dell (  ), Analog Devices (  ), JinkoSolar (JKS), and Perrigo (PRGO). Keep your browser at  for more news as it breaks.Today's docket includes July housing starts, import/export prices, industrial production, and capacity utilization. Inflation data starts to hit the Street on Wednesday, with the release of the producer price index (PPI) and core PPI for July. Initial and continuing jobless claims are on the calendar for Thursday, along with the consumer price index (CPI) and core CPI for July. Traders will also hear about existing home sales and the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators for July, as well as the August Philadelphia Fed index. There are no major economic reports on Friday.Equity option activity on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) saw 976,356 call contracts traded on Monday, compared to 680,288 put contracts. The resultant single-session put/call ratio arrived at 0.70, while the 21-day moving average was 0.73.Asian markets ended mixed today, as troubling economic data kept some bulls on the sidelines. Taking their cues from Wall Street, Seoul-listed equities enjoyed their biggest daily percentage gain in two years after a long holiday weekend. Meanwhile, Google's bid to acquire Motorola Mobility provided a boost for smartphone stocks across the region. However, Shanghai snapped a four-day winning streak, as lingering macroeconomic anxieties prompted a round of profit-taking. By the close, China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng gave up 0.2%, Japan's Nikkei added 0.2%, and South Korea's Kospi rallied 4.8%.European shares are solidly lower at midday, as traders respond to a lackluster reading on Germany's gross domestic product (GDP). In fact, frustratingly sluggish growth in Germany also translated to a softer-than-anticipated reading on the broader euro zone's GDP, which edged up only 0.2% during the three months ended in June. As a result, the bears are firmly in control, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepares to meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss ongoing debt concerns. At last check, the German DAX is down 2.7%, the French CAC 40 has shed 2%, and London's FTSE 100 is off 1.5%.Crude has surrendered a portion of Monday's gains, when M&A mania and an upbeat GDP report from Japan boosted black gold to a close above $87 for the first time since Aug. 3. However, weak data out of Germany is weighing heavily this morning, with crude futures currently 1.2 points, or 1.4%, lower. Meanwhile, the dollar has edged higher this morning -- a factor which also tends to have a negative effect on black gold. Ahead of the open, the U.S. dollar index is up 0.3 point, or 0.4%. Finally, gold is looking to resume its rally to record highs amid an uncertain economic climate, with the precious metal up 21.3 points, or 1.2%, in pre-market trading.Unusual Put and Call Activity:For an explanation of how to use this information, check out our  topics on  and  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Opening View: Investors Ignore Upbeat Earnings as German GDP Weighs on Sentiment@2011-08-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/opening-view-investors-ignore-upbeat-earnings-german-gdp-weighs-sentiment-2011-08-16
he markets got a nice bounce as afternoon buying picked up following the release of the recent Fed meeting minutes. Investors were hoping to see the recent selling subside as new money comes into the market.Leading the way higher were earnings winners Analog Devices (  ) and Abercrombie & Fitch (  ). Shares of CBS Corp. (  ) and Phillip Morris International (  ) also gained on Wall Street analyst upgrades. The commodity sector bounced up as well, led by CF Industries (  ), Freeport McMoran (  ) and equipment giant Caterpillar (  ). Not participating in the rally were shares of Staples (  ), Target (  ), and Deere (  ). All of those companies reported disappointing earnings results. Staples was hit the hardest, as the office supply market continues to be a tough sector to be in. I am often amazed at the rumors we sometimes hear about private equity looking at competitors like OfficeMax (  ) and Office Depot (  ) for takeover opportunities. Just where do they see growth opportunities in that sector?An annual survey from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies out yesterday reported nearly four in 10 workers said they'll work long past the normal retirement age, if they even retire at all. Most recent retirement surveys we've seen have been rather bleak, and I honestly don't see this trend changing any time soon. We've had two years of no social security payout increases, and this year's forecast might call for less than a 1% increase. Most retired individuals are too afraid to put capital into any sort of risk-related investments, including income-producing dividend stocks. With many retirees seeing the bulk of their nest egg tied up in their homes (and the unwillingness to move from the home they have lived most of their lives), there is little about the current situation to get optimistic about. Getting back to social security, the big decision for many is when to begin taking their payments. From the formulas I've seen, taking benefits at age 62 would provide an individual payments that are only 75% of what the same person would receive at age 66. If you decide to delay receiving benefits at age 66, the payout amount is estimated to increase 8% per year until age 70, after which benefits do not increase with age. Unfortunately, many retirees are not in a situation where they can afford to wait it out.The solution for many is to carry a bit more risk in their later years (there's nothing wrong with this if the capital is put to work in high quality dividend-paying stocks), while hoping they can retain employment in their later years. Of course, there is hope for those who have a bit more time on their side. Investing in the  at the earliest point in your life can help offset the current worries facing many today.As your ponder your own retirement picture, I'd like to continue our series on what makes successful people.1. Successful people study their mistakes, while others allow mistakes to consistently repeat.Many individuals either don't want to discuss their errors, or try to erase their mistakes from their mind altogether. In actuality, talking about your financial mistakes is the very best thing you can do. If you make a blunder, it is far more valuable to share your story with those around you than to keep it a secret. Nothing rips apart a happy home faster than money issues. Kids pick up on the vibe quickly as well, and those mistakes can become valuable lessons for young adults to bookmark as they go on in life. Of course, some things are rather complicated to discuss, but there is usually a simple explanation as to where things went wrong. It's essential to identify and discuss your mistakes or you run the risk of forgetting and repeating them.2. Successful people turn complaints into solutions, while others hear the cries for help as simply noise.This topic affects entrepreneurs on a daily basis. Business owners are always trying to please their customers, but there comes a point when a build-up of complaints and ideas can zap an entrepreneur of his passion for the business he's in. Sometimes one needs to look within and analyze why certain complaints come in more often than others. It could be that a certain person in your organization has poor customer service skills and is doing more damage to your business than you initially realize. A smart entrepreneur will pinpoint the sources of complaints and fix the problem as quickly as possible. The same applies to managers of several employees.Complaints will only reflect badly on the person who is paid to make sure mistakes are kept at a minimum. Back in my food store days, we had a great counter person who suffered miserably from allergies. We realized quickly that customers would be turned off from ordering food if they felt the person sounded as if they were sick. So, we found a different job for that person that didn't involved direct contact with customers. You'd be surprised at how many businesses would ignore such an obvious problem. Sometimes you need to head off the complaints before they even start coming in.Thanks for reading, and I'll see you tomorrow! P.S.

"Shutterstock photoStocks ended Monday's wishy-washy session in the red, as an international scandal and lackluster earnings and economic reports weighed on sentiment. Ahead of the bell today, U.S. equities are attempting to muscle their way into the black, as the Street digests an aid package for debt-strapped Portugal and a batch of blue-chip earnings reports. While Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) surpassed analysts' profit projections and Home Depot (HD) upped its full-year earnings forecast, fellow Dow component Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is the proverbial ""Debbie Downer"" of the bunch, slashing its guidance on soft PC sales and Japan-related woes. Against this backdrop -- and ahead of a round of housing data -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA ) is flirting with a 5.6-point lead, while the broader S&P 500 Index (SPX ) is trading just a hair's breadth above fair value.On the earnings front, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT - 56.06) said it earned $3.4 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared to a profit of $3.3 billion, or 87 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales, meanwhile, increased 4.4% to $103.42 billion. The results topped analysts' expectations, with the Street looking for a first-quarter profit of 95 cents per share on revenue of $102.93 billion. In the same vein, WMT said domestic same-store sales fell 1.1%, narrower than the 1.3% decline anticipated by analysts. In addition, the retail titan projected second-quarter earnings in a range of $1.05 to $1.10 per share, compared to the Street's forecast for current-quarter earnings of $1.08 per share. At last check, WMT is trading just below breakeven.Meanwhile, fellow blue chip Home Depot (HD - 36.98) reported a first-quarter profit of $812 million, or 50 cents per share, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue dipped 0.2% to $16.82 billion. Analysts, on average, were calling for a first-quarter profit of 49 cents per share on sales of $17.02 billion. Looking ahead, the firm upped its current-year earnings per share forecast to $2.24 from $2.20. The Street is anticipating full-year earnings of $2.30 per share for the home-improvement hotshot. Ahead of the bell, HD is off about 0.2%.Fellow Dow component Hewlett-Packard (HPQ - 39.80) reported an adjusted fiscal second-quarter profit of $1.24 per share on sales of $31.6 billion. The results topped the Street's forecast for earnings-per-share of $1.21 on sales of $30.8 billion. However, the computer king cut its full-year outlook, citing the impact of Japan's earthquake and weak sales of consumer PCs. For the year, the company expects earnings-per-share of at least $5, and expects revenue between $129 billion and $130 billion. Previously, HPQ projected adjusted full-year earnings of $5.20 to $5.28 per share on revenue of $130 billion to $131.5 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting full-year earnings of $5.24 per share on revenue of $130.22 billion. In pre-market trading, HPQ is set to surrender about 4.5% out of the gate.Moving on, Urban Outfitters (URBN - 32.29) reported a first-quarter profit of $39 million, or 23 cents per share, down 27% from the year-earlier quarter. Analysts, on average, had forecast first-quarter earnings of 25 cents per share for the retailer. Revenue for the quarter rose to $524 million from $480 million, exceeding expectations for sales of $523 million. At last check, URBN has shed close to 0.5%.Finally, Photronics (PLAB - 8.00) swung to a loss of $16.4 million, or 30 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter, down from a profit of $7.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year prior. Excluding items, per-share profit rose to 24 cents from 9 cents, while net sales jumped 27% to $133.1 million. The Street's consensus estimates called for adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share on sales of $120 million. Ahead of the bell, PLAB is set to soar about 10%.Today's earnings docket will feature reports from Analog Devices (  ), Dell (  ), Dick's Sporting Goods (  ), Saks (SKS), TJX Companies (TJX), and Trina Solar (TSL), just to name a few.

The resultant single-session put/call ratio jumped to 0.62, while the 21-day moving average remained at 0.63.Stocks in Asia ended mixed today, with traders carefully considering soft U.S. economic data and ongoing uncertainty in the euro zone. In Japan, utilities continued to lag on concerns that Tokyo Electric Power's debt burden may be waived, but a weakening yen helped stocks claw their way to a positive finish. Shanghai-listed securities also closed higher, buoyed by bargain-hunting, while Foxconn led the laggards in Hong Kong following news that it would be removed from the country's benchmark stock index. Meanwhile, tech stocks paced the losses in South Korea, offsetting strength in banks and defensive issues. By the close, Japan's Nikkei added 0.09%, the Shanghai Composite gained 0.1%, South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.08%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng surrendered 0.3%.European markets are mostly lower at midday, despite strength in mining and energy stocks amid rebounding commodity prices.

"trong Earnings, Dividends and Technicals Following a run to new highs in early April, stocks pulled back briefly, and then drove to new highs on May 2. But profit-taking, signs of a global economic slowdown, and more euro zone debt issues reversed many of the gains made in April. The lowering of Belgium's and Italy's credit outlook and another downgrade of Greece's sovereign debt resulted in renewed selling of the euro and strength in the U.S. dollar, which puts pressure on stocks.However, despite losing some momentum, the bulls remain in very shaky control. The intermediate-term and long-term trends for stocks are still up, but the 50-day moving averages of the major indices are under attack, and a close below them could result in another wave of selling. Short-term traders should exercise caution since an emotional selling climax could happen before the next buying opportunity. But investors with longer-term objectives should buy top stock picks on this pullback, because the interruption of the major advance may only last for a few weeks.This month's top stocks to buy take into consideration the technical conditions of the markets, so more emphasis was placed on a defensive strategy and stocks with steady earnings and dividend growth. And some of our picks could directly benefit from investors' reactions to another world crisis. Here are our top stocks to buy for June:Top Stock to Buy #1 Analog Devices (ADI) (NYSE:  ), which designs and manufactures integrated circuits, reported a 45% increase in FY Q2 earnings along with a bullish Q3 outlook as a result of redirected sales from the slowdowns of Japanese suppliers to the industry. Its sales to communications and automotive clients were much higher than Wall Street analysts had predicted, so the stock is under review by several research firms with the possibility that they may increase their ratings.Following a run from $30 in October to $38 in December, the stock consolidated in a ""cup"" formation with a  at around $37. In May, it broke from that very bullish formation with a trading target of $46 within two months. ADI pays an annual dividend of $1 for a 2.4% yield.Top Stock to Buy #2 Coca-Cola Company (KO) (NYSE:  ) powerful breakout in March, following the deep ""V"" market bottom, drove the stock to new highs in April. KO was one of our  , and it has not been a disappointment.This month, it broke from a  and appears well on its way to achieving a technical target in the high $70s by August. S&P has a ""five-star strong buy"" rating on KO, and Wells Fargo started coverage of the stock with an ""outperform"" rating. Credit Suisse recently raised its 12-month target to $95 from $80.Top Stock to Buy #3 Linn Energy (LINE)Independent oil and natural gas producer  (NASDAQ:  ) has properties in some of the most reliable energy producing regions in the United States. One of my favorite stock pickers, Jeffrey Saut of Raymond James Financial, considers it a ""strong buy,"" and Ford Equity Research also has a ""buy"" rating on LINE.The company reported robust earnings for Q1 and anticipates a very strong 2011 with an expected average distribution coverage ratio of 1.4 times for the remaining quarters. Technically, LINE is trading in a rectangle (consolidation) following an advance that lasted for most of last year. And it has strong support at its 200-day moving average at $36, which also matches the support line of the rectangle. Buy this top stock for a breakout to the mid-$40s by September. LINN pays an annual dividend of $2.64 for a 6.85% yield.Top Stock to Buy #4 NPS Pharmaceuticals (NPSP)Small-cap biotech company  (NASDAQ:  ) is developing therapeutics for gastrointestinal and endocrine disorders, as well as neurological diseases.S&P has a ""four-star buy"" rating on NPSP with a 12-month target of $14. The stock broke from a long-term resistance line at $7.50 in December, and then gapped above $10 in late January. The open gap was filled when the stock meandered back to its bullish support line in March, and then broke to new high in May, as it rested on its intermediate support line now at $9.50. NPSP has strong support at its 50-day moving average and should reach S&P's target, or go even higher, by September.Top Stock to Buy #5 UGI Corp. (UGI) (NYSE:  ), a natural gas utility holding company, distributes propane and operates various gas and electric utilities. It has steadily increased profits by acquiring non-utility businesses like PG Energy in Pennsylvania. One of its subsidiaries, AmeriGas, is the largest U.S. propane retail marketer.S&P has a ""five-star strong buy"" rating on the stock with a 12-month target of $37. UGI pays an annual dividend of $1.04 for a 3.2% yield, and states that its earnings-per-share growth target is 6% to 10% with dividend growth of 4% annually.The stock has settled into a bull channel with a bottom around $32 and top of $34. UGI is a steady producer and a long-term investment that should provide a higher-than-average total return.Top Stock to Buy #6 Yamana Gold (AUY)Canadian-based gold miner  (NYSE:  ) made a high at just over $13.40 early in April, but in several weeks fell to support at just under $12. It has been one of our favorite gold stocks since breaking above $12 in November. Since then, several corrections followed after spikes to new highs, but whenever the stock pulls back to its bullish support line and 200-day moving average, we recommend buying it.Q1 earnings were strong, and the company increased its dividend by 50% to 18 cents per share. Credit Suisse Equity Research rates AUY an ""outperform"" with a target of $15. This stock could be the ""sleeper"" in the precious metals sector with a run to the mid-teens or higher by fall.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Top 6 Stocks for June@2011-05-23@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-6-stocks-june-2011-05-23
There is little doubt the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan last month (as well as any further aftershocks) will have macroeconomic effects that will hamper semiconductor demand in the country. Assessing the extent of the damage is still an ongoing process, and the final tally likely will take months to sort out. Perhaps the first attempt to size up the damage came from Taiwan Semiconductor (  ), the global leader in outsourced chip manufacturing, which cut its forecast for global semiconductor growth in 2011 to 4% from 7% (excluding memory chips). We should be able to gain additional insight from a host of first-quarter earnings conference calls from chipmakers in mid-April, but in the meantime, we've summarized our initial thoughts concerning the damage.Japan is one of the bigger consumers of semiconductors and is home to many electronic device makers, including Sony (  ) and Nikon. Aside from the country's fewer purchases of electronics and other goods that contain chips, such as PCs and smartphones, Japanese electronics makers have seen manufacturing stoppages due to both structural damage to their facilities and consistent power outages in the region, which likely will cause a near-term decline in new chip orders. Further, many chipmakers, especially analog firms, are suppliers to Japan's automobile manufacturers, which also have seen production stoppages. Thus, chipmakers across the board likely will see lower near-term demand. Companies with notable exposure to Japan include Linear Technology (  ) and Analog Devices (  ), which each generate about 15% of their sales from the country, and Intel (  ), with roughly 10% of its revenue from the region.On the supply side of the equation, Japan is home to many semiconductor firms and chip fabrication plants which were interrupted by the disaster. Texas Instruments' (TXN) plant in Miho contributes about 10% of the firm's total revenue, but was knocked off line and production won't resume until mid-April; full production won't resume until mid-July, and full shipments won't occur until September. Texas Instruments' digital light projector ((DLP)) devices are made in Miho, and although they account for less than 5% of TI's revenue, the business is dependent on springtime production, as these projectors are ultimately sold during back-to-school season. An article from Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes indicated that TI's Miho plant also produced controller chips for motors in hard disk drives (HDDs), and if the HDD supply chain were to be disrupted, other chipmakers such as Marvell (MRVL) and LSI (LSI) also may suffer in the near term.Privately-held Renesas, another key chipmaker and Japan's largest microcontroller ((MCU)) manufacturer, still has one fabrication plant knocked out by the damage and is suffering from lesser damage and power outages at seven other plants. One firm that might be able to take advantage of Renesas' misfortunes is U.S.-based Microchip Technology (MCHP), which already had been gaining share from Renesas in the 8-bit MCU market before announcing a flood of new MCU orders after the quake.Unfortunately, bigger problems for the semiconductor industry might be found further down the supply chain with the raw material suppliers. Mitsubishi Gas Chemical is a primary producer of a specific resin used in chip packaging, but the company won't be running at full capacity until May. A variety of chipmakers that outsource the packaging function to third parties could see indirect supply interruptions. Also, Shin-Etsu Group and Sumco Corp, two large suppliers of silicon wafers--the main raw material used in chip manufacturing--currently are knocked out by the disaster. Ultimately, chipmakers with little to no manufacturing or customer presence in Japan may be forced to cope with raw material shortages and supply chain troubles as well.There also have been disruptions to the production of computer memory ((DRAM)) and NAND flash memory chips, which already have materially affected the supply and pricing in both of these markets. SanDisk (SNDK) and Toshiba, which have joint venture NAND flash memory manufacturing plants in Japan, reported that both of their NAND fabs were shut down for a brief period because of the earthquake. The SanDisk/Toshiba joint venture accounts for about 35% of flash memory production, so the incident likely will have a substantial affect on industry supply. Although operations have resumed, any disturbances to a fab, even a small one, can have significant effects on output. For example, a very short power outage in December caused a Toshiba/SanDisk fab to lose 20% of production and precipitated a 3%-11% increase in flash memory contract prices, according to DRAMexchange.The earthquake already has caused NAND flash memory prices to rise in anticipation of supply constraints. DRAM pricing also increased after Japan's only computer memory producer, Elpida, suffered a power outage after the earthquake that disrupted production at one of its manufacturing facilities. Elpida's market share in the DRAM space is roughly 10%, according to Micron (MU). The higher pricing for DRAM and NAND flash memory should benefit other major memory players, such as Micron, Samsung, and Hynix (all three supply NAND and DRAM), as these firms don't have fabs in Japan and will be able to capture additional business in the near term.Not surprisingly, we also expect the semiconductor equipment industry to see some effects from the disruptions being seen at Japanese chipmakers. According to estimates from IC Insights, capital spending from Japanese chipmakers (we include U.S.-based SanDisk because the firm's only fabs are in Japan) had been expected to account for about 12% of total semiconductor industry spending in 2011, which isn't too substantial. While we now expect to see lower capital expenditures from this group for the year, we think semiconductor equipment demand from Japanese chipmakers more likely will be delayed rather than reduced. For example, the big Japanese fab project from Toshiba/SanDisk, Fab 5, was expected to come on line this summer. However, given the disruptions all over Japan, we believe the firms will have to finish the fab at a later date.In addition, some chipmakers will need to replace damaged equipment in their manufacturing plants, which could be a benefit to semiconductor equipment companies like Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). In the last three years, sales to Japan have ranged from 7% to 13% at Applied Materials and 13% to 29% at KLA. While Japanese chipmakers sometimes prefer domestic semiconductor equipment suppliers, major U.S.-based companies do have significant presences in the country. There have been reports of interruptions at some Japanese chip equipment firms, including at Tokyo Electron, which could result in more business for U.S. and other foreign-based companies. Gigaphoton, the smaller firm in a photolithography light source duopoly with Cymer (CYMI), has suffered major disruptions to its operations, which could benefit Cymer in the near term.Surely, no chipmaker will declare itself a winner from the tragedy in Japan, especially with the extent of supply chain interruptions and the potential decline in Japan's GDP still to be determined. Yet we still see the possibility of some firms losing out much less than others. Chipmakers that might be able to capitalize on an improved pricing environment or a competitor's misfortunes, such as Micron or Microchip, may see a near-term boost in revenue. Also, the massive rebuilding efforts needed in Japan may spur the purchase of infrastructure and electronics with higher silicon content per device. Corporations that have to replace damaged PCs and servers will be forced to upgrade to products that may include Intel's latest line of processors, for example. Similarly, car owners who lost their vehicles may look toward hybrid and electric cars, which have greater silicon content and could drive longer-term chip demand for a host of analog chipmakers. Nonetheless, we're still in wait-and-see mode with the semiconductor industry, and we think it would be reckless to get extremely bullish about most chipmakers' near-term prospects without considering the tragedy in Japan.

"t's been pretty amazing to see the trend of quick morning spikes, followed by 5-6 hours of a tight trading range whenever we get the triple digit gains on the Dow (which we saw again yesterday).This type of action certainly stirs the pot for market conspiracy theorists. We all know the Federal Reserve has been active in the financial markets with liquidity, so the action should not be too much of a shock. The key thing to watch is if the pattern starts to change.Here at Dividend.com, we've been able to successfully navigate through any sort of market environment as we look for the best dividend investment opportunities we can find. Investors need to focus on this area as well. There have been too many people that have remained on the sidelines for fear of the markets tumbling. Sitting in cash for long periods of time rarely makes for the best strategy. We're certainly not known here as the most bullish of market pundits, but we don't want investors to get hooked on trying to time the markets either. We still have a number of potential new recommendations we are eying, but also know that we may need to make changes to our current list if need be.As we look at today's action, there were some well-known plays that powered higher, despite the sluggish averages. Nike (  ), Wynn Resorts (  ), Walter Energy (  ), and Cliffs Natural Resources (  ) paced the gainers' list. On the flipside, Disney (  ) and Boeing (  ) were a couple of weak performers. Be sure to check out the ""Market Themes""  for some notes on this week's action and a look toward next week.Speaking of next week's holiday-shortened trading, there will be fewer earnings on the board, but we will be getting reports from Deere (  ), Tiffany (  ) and Analog Devices (  ), to name a few.

"Shutterstock photoThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) clawed its way back above the 11,200 level on Friday, but the blue chip barometer's victory may be short-lived. Specifically, futures on the DJIA and the S&P 500 Index (SPX) are trading 19.5 points and 1.6 points below fair value, respectively, pointing toward a weak start to the regular session of trading. European debt concerns remain front and center, as some on Wall Street believe that a bailout of Ireland will not be enough to stabilize the region. Additionally, Moody's Investors Service said that a ""multi-notch downgrade"" of Ireland's Aa2 rating is now the ""most likely"" outcome of its credit review. Technically, the DJIA should find support near 11,100, with resistance holding firm in the 11,200-11,250 area. The SPX, meanwhile, should trade between the 1,200 and 1,190 levels.In equity news, Tyson Foods Inc. (  ) reported fourth-quarter net income of $208 million, or 57 cents per share, compared to a loss of $457 million, or $1.23 per share a year ago. Adjusted earnings were 64 cents per share. Sales rose to $7.44 billion from $7.24 billion last year. Analysts were expecting a profit of 56 cents per share on sales of $7.71 billion.Elsewhere, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (  ) announced that it will restate its financial performance for fiscal years 2007 to 2009 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 due to errors. The errors were found while the company prepared for its year-end audit and conducted an internal investigation prompted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The adjustments are expected to lower cumulative net income by 4 cents to 5 cents per share, the company said. In pre-market trading, GMCR shares were last seen up nearly 12%, as investors were expecting the adjustments to be much worse.On the earnings front, Analog Devices Inc. (  ), Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (  ), Focus Media Holding Limited (  ), Hewlett-Packard Company (HPQ), Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK), La-Z-Boy Inc.

Shutterstock photoThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) added about 10 points on Wednesday, as market bulls overcame a weak energy sector to finish higher for the second session in a row. The DJIA is still staring up at resistance in the 10,450 region, where the blue-chip barometer's 200-day moving average currently resides. Look for token support near 10,400 in today's trading, while more stalwart support should emerge near 10,300. Heading into the open, the DJIA is trading flat to lower compared to fair value, pointing toward a bit of trepidation ahead of economic reports on weekly jobless claims, July's leading indicators, and manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region. Futures on the S&P 500 Index (SPX) are also relatively flat, with the broad-market index apparently unwilling to test battle resistance at the 1,100 level again today. Finally, the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) could be gearing up for a sharp move, as the VIX's trading range becomes increasingly narrowed by resistance at its 50-day trendline (near 26) and support at its 200-day moving average (currently at 23.50).Ahead of the open this morning, Sears Holdings Corp. (  ) narrowed its second-quarter net loss to $39 million, or 35 cents per share, from $94 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. The company reported an adjusted net loss of 19 cents per, missing the consensus forecast for a loss of 17 cents per share. Sales inched lower to $10.46 billion from $10.55 billion.Also in pre-market activity, Staples Inc. (  ) said its adjusted second-quarter earnings were 20 cents per share, matching Wall Street's expectations for a profit of 20 cents per share. Sales were flat at $5.5 billion. Looking ahead, the company said it expects sales to rise in the low single digits in the third quarter and expects adjusted earnings of 39 to 41 cents per share. For the full year, Staples expects a low single-digit rise in sales, with adjusted earnings in a range of $1.25 to $1.29 per share.After the close last night, NetApp Inc. (  ) reported a first-quarter profit of $183 million, or 49 cents per share, excluding items, on revenue of $1.14 billion. Analysts were looking for a profit of 46 cents per share on $1.13 billion in sales.Finally, Applied Materials Inc. (  ) reported adjusted third-quarter earnings of 17 cents per share, as revenue rose to $2.52 billion. The company's adjusted profit also included a restructuring charge of 12 cents per share. Excluding that charge, non-GAAP earnings would have been 29 cents per share. Analysts had expected the chip-equipment maker to report earnings of 25 cents per share, on revenue of $2.35 billion.On the earnings front, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (  ), The Home Depot Inc. (  ), Saks Inc. (  ), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (  ), and Analog Devices Inc. (  ) are scheduled to release their quarterly earnings report today.

The resultant single-session put/call ratio arrived at 0.67, while the 21-day moving average rose to 0.62.Overseas trading looks strong this morning, as all 10 of the foreign indexes that we track are in positive territory. The cumulative average return on the collective stands at a gain of 0.72%. In Asia, Japanese stocks led the rally, with traders cheering the possibility of easing monetary policy by the Bank of Japan. European stocks are following Asia's lead, with the region rallying around strong U.K. retail sales data and a boosted outlook for Germany's growth forecast by Bundesbank.The U.S. Dollar Index is on the move higher again this morning, as the greenback advances on both the Japanese yen and the euro. Currency traders have zeroed in on Japan this morning, as the country's central bank is debating additional easing in monetary policy. At last check, the U.S. Dollar Index was up 0.13% at 82.34. Crude futures are rebounding after tagging a six-week low on Wednesday. In electronic trading, the front-month contract is up 30 cents at $76.08 per barrel. Finally, the decline in the euro and the rise in the U.S. dollar is creating a bit of drag on gold futures this morning, as the most active contract is down 40 cents at $1,231 an ounce in London.Unusual Put and Call Activity:For an explanation of how to use this information, check out our  topics on  and  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Opening View: DJIA Futures Treading Water; VIX on the Move?@2010-08-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/opening-view-djia-futures-treading-water-vix-move-2010-08-19
"s the U.S.'s recovery from the ""Great Recession"" has progressed, one big driver of the turnaround has been the industrial and manufacturing arena. Industrial production rose in November by 0.4%, according to a new Federal Reserve report, marking the 15th time in 17 months that production has increased. And since bottoming in July 2009, the manufacturing sector has expanded for 16 straight months, according to the Institute for Supply Management.As a result, industrial and manufacturing stocks -- which were hammered during the recession and bear market -- have outpaced the broader market since the March 2009 low. But, just as there's still slack in U.S. production, so too are there still bargains in the industrial and manufacturing areas. And, with government stimulus continuing to flow into the economy, consumers regaining some of their confidence, and companies having cut a lot of fat during the downturn, some of these stocks are in good position to continue rebounding.Keep in mind, however, that as we get deeper into the recovery, the rising tide that may have lifted a lot of industrial/manufacturing-type stocks should lessen, and investors will likely become more discriminating about which of these stocks they buy. That means you better pay attention to fundamentals on a stock-by-stock basis. With that in mind, I recently used my Guru Strategies, each of which is based on the approach of a different investing great, to uncover some of the industrials and manufacturers that have the best fundamentals. Here's a sampling of what I found. Based in Thomasville, Ga., Flowers operates 40 bakeries, mostly in the southern and mid-Atlantic U.S., producing a variety of breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and pastries. Its products, which include Sunbeam bread and Mrs. Freshley's Jumbo Honey Buns, are distributed both fresh and frozen to foodservice and retail customers.Flowers ($2.4 billion market cap) gets high marks from two of my models. My Peter Lynch-inspired strategy considers it a ""fast-grower"" because of its 20.5% long-term earnings per share growth rate (I use an average of the three-, four-, and five-year EPS figures to determine a long-term rate.) Lynch famously used the P/E/Growth ratio to find bargain-priced growth stocks, and when we divide Flowers' 18.1 price/earnings ratio (using trailing 12-month earnings) by that long-term growth rate, we get a P/E/G of 0.88, which comes in under the model's 1.0 upper limit.Another reason this approach likes Flowers is the firm's financing: The company has a debt/equity ratio of just 18%.My James O'Shaughnessy-based growth model also likes Flowers, in part because it has upped EPS in each year of the past five-year period. O'Shaughnessy found that the price/sales ratio was a better indicator of future success than the P/E ratio, and this model likes P/S ratios below 1.5. At 0.95, Flowers makes the grade. One of the largest metals service center companies in the U.S., Reliance makes over 100,000 metal products that range from stainless steel to aluminum to brass to copper and beyond. The Los Angeles-based firm ($3.7 billion market cap) has a network of more than 200 locations in 38 states and countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.Reliance gets approval from one of my best-performing strategies, the model I base on the writings of Benjamin Graham. Graham was an extremely conservative investor, and this approach requires a firm to have a current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of at least 2.0, and more net current assets than long-term debt. Reliance's current ratio is 2.92, and it has $1.3 billion in net current assets vs. $944 million in long-term debt.Graham is known as the ""Father of Value Investing"", so valuation was, of course, important to him. The strategy I base on his writings looks at both the P/E ratio and price/book ratio. Reliance is trading for about 14.9 times TTM earnings and 1.3 times book/value, which makes it sufficiently cheap to pass this strategy. This Virginia-based firm is one of the U.S.'s largest aerospace & defense firms, making battle tanks and assault vehicles, armaments and munitions, battleships and nuclear submarines, and military information technology systems. The $26-billion-market-cap firm has taken in more than $30 billion in sales over the past 12 months.General Dynamics gets approval from my Joel Greenblatt-inspired model. In his Little Book that Beats the Market, Greenblatt detailed a remarkably simple, remarkably successful approach that used just two variables: earnings yield and return on capital. With a 13.9% earnings yield and 57.7% return on total capital, General Dynamics is the 34th-highest-rated stock in the market, according to my Greenblatt-based model.My Lynch-based model also likes GD, which it considers a ""stalwart"" because of the firm's moderate 14.8% long-term EPS growth rate and high sales. Lynch found that these types of big, steady firms offered protection against downturns and recessions. Since these kinds of companies often pay dividends, Lynch adjusted the ""G"" portfolio of the P/E/G ratio to include dividend yield when analyzing them. With its 10.8 P/E, 2.4% yield, and that 14.8% growth rate, General Dynamics has a very solid yield-adjusted P/E/G of 0.63, a sign that its shares are a bargain. In addition, the firm has a very reasonable 23.6% debt/equity ratio. This 72-year-old Minnesota-based firm produces and sells 500 industrial chemicals and 600 reagent grade laboratory chemicals, which are used by everything from pharmacies to water treatment facilities to food and dairy producers to research labs, and beyond.Hawkins ($500 million market cap) is another favorite of my Lynch-based model. The firm has been growing EPS at a 32% clip over the long term, and that and its 20.1 P/E ratio make for a solid 0.63 P/E/G. In addition, the company has a very strong balance sheet -- it has no long-term debt -- another reason the Lynch-based model likes it. Analog is sort of a high-tech industrial, manufacturing electronic equipment that translates real-world phenomena like temperature, pressure, sound, light, speed and motion into electrical signals. These signals are used in a variety of products, including medical imaging equipment, factory automation systems, portable electronic devices, energy management systems, wireless communications equipment, digital cameras, cars, and digital televisions.Analog ($11 billion market cap) is another stock that gets high marks from my Lynch-based strategy. It considers the stock a ""stalwart"" because of its 16% long-term EPS growth rate and multi-billion-dollar annual sales. The strategy likes the stock's 0.88 yield-adjusted P/E/G, as well as the fact that its inventory/sales ratio decreased from 12.6% two years ago to 10.1% this past year. Lynch astutely observed that unwanted inventory piling up is a bad sign, so this strategy likes to see a declining inventory/sales figure. It also likes Analog's 12.5% debt/equity ratio.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Industrial-Strength Picks From the Gurus@2010-12-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/industrial-strength-picks-gurus-2010-12-17
nalog Devices is popping on strong results, but some traders are worried about a pullback.optionMONSTER's Depth Charge tracking system detected the purchase of about 3,500 June 30 puts for $2.05 to $2.60 against open interest of 1,029. The trades appeared in two blocks: first as ADI was climbing, and again after the stock rolled over. ADI rose 2.72 percent to $28.35 in morning trading. The chipmaker had risen as much as 5.7 percent after reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings, forecasting a bullish third quarter, and raising its dividend yesterday amid strong automotive demand.The stock is down 7 percent in the last month, and failed to hold gains after similarly positive results from Intel on April 13 as investors worry the European debt crisis will hamper the global economic recovery.Because they used in-the-money contracts, ADI must only fall 2 percent for today's puts to turn a profit. The strategy reflects a belief that the stock is worth owning but could be buffeted by selling in the broader market.ADI has also been struggling to fight back above its 200-day moving average, which it fell below earlier in the month for the first time in a year (purple line). Some chart watchers may consider that a bearish signal.Overall options volume in the stock is almost 4 times greater than average, with puts accounting for 82 percent of the activity.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Pullback seen for Analog Devices@2010-05-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pullback-seen-analog-devices-2010-05-19

Shutterstock photoThe market bulls flexed a little muscle on Monday afternoon, lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average (  ) out of a 180-point deficit and allowing the blue-chip barometer to close positive on the session - even if the Dow was only fractionally higher. Short-term support at the 10,600 level and the DJIA's 20-week moving average appears to have held, but longer-term overhead resistance still lingers over head in the 10,850 area (which is home to the Dow's 10-week trendline). Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index (  ) remains pinned between resistance at its 20-week moving average (near 1,140) and support at its 50-day trendline. The latter moving average contained the SPX's lows in February, and should be significant support going forward. As for today, it appears that we have a positive bias heading into the open, with futures on the DJIA and SPX trading roughly 42 points and 4.5 points above fair value, respectively. On the sentiment front, it appears that skepticism it beginning to make a healthy comeback, as the 21-day moving average of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (  ) single-session, equity only put/call ratio has reached its highest level since March 19.In earnings news, The Home Depot Inc. (  ) reported first-quarter earnings of 45 cents per share, excluding times, as sales rose 4.3% to $16.86 billion. Same-store sales were up 4.8% for the quarter. Analysts were expecting a profit of 40 cents per share on sales of $16.36 billion. Looking ahead, Home Depot said it expects annual earnings of $1.88 per share on sales growth of approximately 3.5%, compared to Wall Street's expectations for earnings of $1.86 per share and sales growth of 2.9%. HD shares are up fractionally in pre-market trading, rising 0.14%.Finally, Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

A late turnaround in U.S. markets overnight, when the dollar pulled back from a four-year high against the euro, failed to inspire investors as they remained wary of the problems in Europe. In fact, news that the U.S. Senate would oppose International Monetary Fund (  ) bailout packages to countries that are unlikely to repay them, raised concerns about the spread of Greek debt problems.

"Shutterstock photoThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slipped fractionally on Monday, as Wall Street bulls came out in force to defend support in the 10,300 region. This morning, the bulls' hard work appears to have paid off, as the blue-chip barometer could be headed toward an end of its five-session losing streak. At last check, DJIA futures were indicating an opening gain of about 52 points, with strong quarterly results from retailing giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (  ) and home-improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. (  ) providing rally fuel.

Finally, the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) experienced an outside day on Monday. An ""outside day"" is a technical formation where a stock or index hits a higher high and a lower low than the previous day. With the VIX closing lower yesterday, this technical formation could indicate that the index is set to reverse course and decline once again, potentially breaching short-term support near the 25 level in the process.In equity news, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.

"Shutterstock photoWade W. Slome, CFA, CFP is President and Founder of Newport Beach, California based  . He managed one of the ten largest growth funds in the country ($20 billion in assets under management) at American Century Investments, and currently manages a hedge fund in addition to separate customized accounts for a selective client base at his firm.• • •I don't really have a  conviction stock,  , in my fund since I treat all my stocks like children - I love them all. Having said that,  is a holding of mine that exhibits many of the characteristics I look for in an investment. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota based company is named after ""Nonvolatile Electronics,"" which refers to memory technology that retains data even when power is removed - a critical attribute for certain applications. NVE Corp. is a market leader in nanotechnology sensors, couplers, and MRAM intellectual property (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory). NVE's microscopic technology enables the transmission, acquisition, and storage of data across a broad array of applications, including implantable medical devices, mission critical defense weapons, and industrial robots. Major customers include St. Jude Medical, Inc. (  ), Starkey Laboratories, Inc., and the U.S. Government.The company's coupler and sensor businesses have been ridiculously profitable. Even over a period covering one of the worst global financial crises in decades, NVE managed to increase its operating margins from an already very respectable 40% range in Fiscal 2007 (ending March) to a stunning 56%+ level in Fiscal 2009.Beyond sensors and couplers, NVE Corp. is optimistic about the potential for the MRAM market. However, outside of a few one-time licensing fees, NVE is currently generating effectively zero revenues from this nascent storage technology. Rather than produce the technology, NVE Corp. is looking to leverage their IP portfolio by licensing out the patents and subsequently receiving royalties from the MRAM device manufacturers. MRAM technology uses magnetic fields to record information, but unlike tape recorders in which a short section of tape holds magnetic information, with MRAM data it is held by electrons. Believe it or not, this method is highly reliable and is very power-efficient relative to other storage technology alternatives. Currently, the problem with MRAM is the cost prohibitive manufacturing requirements relative to other memories (such as DRAM, SRAM, and Flash), but costs are expected to come down over time. For some MRAM believers, the technology is considered the ""Holy Grail"" because it may have the potential to combine the speed of SRAM, the density of DRAM, and the non-volatility of Flash memory in a universal source.If the unproven potential of MRAM ever blossoms, the broad portfolio of NVE Corp.'s MRAM patents should represent a very sizable profit opportunity. Of course, NVE Corp. must first establish the validity of its MRAM intellectual property and appropriately charge and collect royalties for IP usage. How big can the MRAM market be? Some size the MRAM market in the billions and Toshiba has stated they expect the MRAM market to surpass the size of the traditional memory markets by 2015.No matter how one measures the size of the market, there will be a substantial revenue opportunity for NVE Corp. if every smart-phone, gaming device and laptop exclusively uses universal MRAM - rather than a combination of DRAM, SRAM, and Flash technologies.Generally speaking, I am a bottom-up investor. I may have concrete views on a particular industry, but the fundamentals of a company will be the main determinant of my investment thesis. Overall, I am looking for market-leading franchises that can sustain above-average growth rates for extended periods of time. These traits can come from either a company operating in a mature, sleepy industry (take for example Google in the advertising world) or from a more dynamic growth industry like nanotechnology in the case of NVE Corp.I believe the nanotechnology industry is in the very early innings of an innovation revolution with regard to new applications and products. Like semiconductors, the economies of scale and technological advances of NVE Corp.'s ""spintronic"" technology should continually allow faster, smaller, more reliable solutions at lower bit prices. In my view, this snowballing effect will only increase the penetration of nanotechnology solutions and introduce an ever increasing list of new applications.NVE Corp. has competitors along all three of its spintronic businesses. In their sensor business, most of the competition comes from the makers of legacy electromechanical magnetic sensors, including HermeticSwitch, Inc., Meder Electronic AG (Germany), and Memscap SA (France).In the coupler space, NVE Corp. faces a larger list of well capitalized, household semiconductor names, including Avago (  ), Fairchild Semiconductor International (  ), NEC Corporation, Sharp Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Vishay Intertechnology (  ), Analog Devices, Inc. (  ), Silicon Laboratories Inc. (  ), and Texas Instruments Incorporated (  ).A different set of competitors are searching for the MRAM holy grail, including the following companies: Crocus Technology SA (France), Grandis, Inc., MagSil Corporation, Spintec (France), Spintron (France), Spintronics Plc ((  )), and IBM.There is undoubtedly a ton of competition in the spintronics space, but as of October 2009, NVE Corp. has 52 issued U.S. patents and over 100 patents worldwide (either issued, pending, or licensed from others) - many focused on the potentially lucrative MRAM field. Although NVE Corp. has many competitors, they have dominant share in the coupler/sensor market when it comes to high-end, merchant supplied solutions. Moreover, on the MRAM side of the business, the company has already licensed its intellectual property to several companies, including Cypress Semiconductor (  ), Honeywell International Inc. (  ), and Motorola, Inc. (  ).Valuation is a key component for all my stock investments. In my valuation work I pore over the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement in deriving my price targets.One area helping NVE Corp.'s valuation case is its improving trend-line of profitability. Over the last 5 years alone, gross margins have gone from 40% to over 70% - not a bad business model if you can execute it. The company also has a pristine balance sheet. Not only does NVE Corp. have no debt, but it also is sitting on a growing mound of cash/investments (over $43 million), representing more than 20% of the company's market capitalization. Finally, the company in my view is attractively priced on a free cash flow basis (cash from operations minus capital expenditures), yielding around 6% of the total company value.With small cap stocks like NVE Corp., sentiment and lack of liquidity can create gut-wrenching volatility. Unlike many growth investors who pay more attention to positive momentum factors (price direction), I welcome volatility as it allows me to find more attractive entry and exit points.That said, NVE Corp. hit a peak stock price north of $63 per share in early September fueled by 41% revenue growth in their June quarter (fiscal Q1). Subsequently, in fiscal Q2 (ending September 30th), revenue growth decelerated to +14% causing momentum investors to take NVE Corp.'s shares to the woodshed. With the stock down about -35% from its recent crest, I find the valuation only that much more attractive.Wall Street estimates are calling for further slowing in revenue growth in the coming quarter, so the short term sentiment may or may not continue to sour. Timing bottoms is inherently dangerous and not something I consider myself an expert at. Absent a major deterioration in fundamentals, I stand ready to add to my position if NVE Corp.'s share price falls and valuation metrics improve.I would argue the typical consensus view advocates selling shares when revenue growth slows. Many of my best performing stocks have been purchased during transitory periods of slowing or cyclical downturns. Let's hope that's the case with NVE Corp.Absolutely. There is a continual debate over what is more important, the jockey or the horse. My investment philosophy puts more weight on the jockey than the horse. Obviously, I'm looking for the combination of a talented management team and a solid business model.When it comes to NVE Corp., Daniel Baker, Ph.D. has done a phenomenal job managing the hyper-growth profile of the company, while preserving prudent and conservative financial values. For the third year in a row, Dr. Baker was also recognized as one of the best U.S. CEOs in the semiconductors and semiconductor equipment industry by  and financial consulting firm DeMarche Associates.At the end of the day, it's difficult to argue with a track record of success. Since Dr. Baker took over, revenues have more than tripled, and earnings have grown from $0.01 in Fiscal 2001 to $2.04 in Fiscal 2009.Since I hold a longer term investment horizon, catalysts are not a driving aspect to my investment process. But clearly, any additional evidence unearthed in the marketplace validating the growth in the MRAM market, or announcements confirming the value of NVE Corp.'s MRAM intellectual property, should provide support to the stock price.Beyond that, given where the stock is trading now, I believe merely continuing the execution on their sensor and coupler business provides adequate upside prospects.Investing in small cap technology stocks comes with a whole host of risks. Although I don't believe the positive scenario of critical mass MRAM commercialization is baked into the current stock price, I nevertheless understand any setbacks announced relative to NVE Corp.'s MRAM prospects or the industry's MRAM expectations will likely result in stock price pressure.NVE also has significant customer concentration, therefore a loss or cutback in sales from a lead customer will probably contribute to price volatility.From a macro perspective, the company has battled successfully through the economic crisis and proven itself somewhat recession resistant. Nonetheless, the company has sizeable exposure to the industrial segment and would not be immune from the ""double-dip"" economic recession scenario.Surely there are additional hazards to this investment, however these are some of the risks I am currently focused on.NVE Corp. is not a stock for the faint of heart. However, for those who can stomach the volatility, I encourage you to do some more homework on NVE Corp. Not only will you learn about a phenomenally managed, very profitable, attractively priced nanotechnology company, but you will also gain insight into a leading force behind the eyes, nerves, and brains powering the electronic systems of our future.My pleasure.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Smallcap Nanotech Company NVE Is Wade Slome's Highest Conviction Holding - Here's Why@2010-01-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/smallcap-nanotech-company-nve-wade-slomes-highest-conviction-holding-heres-why-2010-01-05
"he markets continue to shake a lot of investors up with the recent pullback.
