We are\r\ndeveloping a suite of clinical-stage drug candidates, ourselves and with our\r\npartners, from our proprietary XmAb\u00ae technology platforms that are designed to\r\ntreat cancer and autoimmune diseases. In contrast to conventional approaches to\r\nantibody design, which focus on the segment of antibodies that interact with\r\ntarget antigens, our protein engineering efforts and the XmAb technologies are\r\nfocused on the parts of the antibody that interacts with multiple segments of\r\nthe immune system and controls antibody structure. This segment, referred to as\r\nthe Fc domain, is constant and interchangeable among antibodies. Our engineered\r\nFc domains, the XmAb technology, can be readily substituted for natural Fc\r\ndomains.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f02%2f25%2f0001558370-20-001256.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Allen Yang", "title": "Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President"}, {"name": "Bassil I.
