There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $144.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $190.00.  The standard deviation is $13.466.


But the whole reason to look at the average VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $165.43/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $165.43 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

"Investors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the July 17th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new July 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $140.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $153.41/share today.

Because the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.10% return on the cash commitment, or 17.98% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $145.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $153.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.36% if the stock gets called away at the July 17th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.32% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.26% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 39%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 37%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $153.41) to be 36%.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q1 2020 , Good day everyone and welcome to the Verisk first-quarter 2020 earnings results conference call. [Operator instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's head of investor relations. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead. -- Thank you operator, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first-quarter 2020 finances. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's chairman, president, and chief executive officer, who will provide a brief overview of our business. Mark Anquillare, chief operating officer, will then provide an update on our insurance segments.Lee Shavel, chief financial officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Verisk Analytics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance including, but not limited to, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.  -- Thanks Stacey and good morning everyone. I'm very glad to be together today. We are in the midst of a challenge that is impacting each one of us. The outbreak of the coronavirus is, above all, a health crisis, and we hope that you and your families are doing what is necessary to stay safe.Our thoughts and prayers go out to those who have been directly affected by the virus and to the healthcare community and essential personnel working heroically to help us all overcome it. Today, I'm pleased to discuss how Verisk has responded to the COVID-19 event and give you a view of our plans and priorities for the company. I have really been looking forward to this meeting. Along with Mark and Lee, we will describe for you three things: first, our actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak with a focus on protecting our employees and serving our customers; second, an update on our current operations and the role we are playing to help our customers and communities navigate COVID 19; and third, our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk.Given our presence in Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore, the COVID-19 event began for us in January. Our global crisis management team immediately began pandemic planning under our business continuity policy. Under the strong leadership of our Asia Pacific team, we followed government guidance and moved into a remote work mode with zero interruption in delivery for our customers. When local guidance modified, we moved to a hybrid mode, with teams making use of our facilities on an every-other-day basis in order to keep density down.Again, movement into this work mode was seamless. When a second wave of infection appeared in Singapore, we successfully returned to the remote mode. All of this experience was invaluable as January turned to February to March, and it became clear that the coronavirus was not a regional but a global event. Combining our experience in Asia Pacific with our long-standing plans for ensuring business continuity, we engaged in large-scale pressure testing of our remote work capabilities in North America, Europe and India, and we did this weeks in advance of any government restrictions on movement.I was pleased, but not surprised, at the results. We moved our roughly 9,000 colleagues into a full remote mode with no interruption of operations or service to our customers. We remain in that mode today. Our primary goal was, and continues to be, the safety of our colleagues.Because of the essentially digital nature of what we do and our strong movement toward enabling technologies, such as cloud computing, we knew that we could protect the well-being of our team without sacrificing service to our customers. An interesting fact about Verisk is that only about 100 people or roughly 1% of the team have a specific and regular need to enter our facilities. Despite the increased need to communicate digitally with one another and customers, our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require. To highlight the relative ease of the transition, one of the more custom responses to the COVID event has involved our software developers and data scientists.In the office, they are accustomed to having two, sometimes three, large monitors running simultaneously at their workstations. Lacking these at home, we arranged to have the equipment sent to their residences to help these valuable colleagues remain productive. While we look forward to all being together again in our offices, our business continuity planning and the nature of our operations enable us to continue to serve our customers and drive our innovation agenda forward in a work-from-home mode, while also flexibly following the lead of government officials about when it is safe to return. We have also significantly increased communication, with daily updates to our global workforce which we call the daily dose.We have held frequent worldwide town halls and have provided the team access to our COVID-19 resource center which updates teammates with our leading research on the pandemic as well as helpful personal advice on staying healthy and productive. Finally, we began by holding daily meetings of our global executive team and have modified that rhythm as the stability of our operations has been clear. We are now holding regular update calls with our executive team as well as with our board of directors. That's the journey we have been on up to this moment.So where do we stand? First, our teams remain highly active and productive. Sales calls are up versus prior years. E-mail traffic is greater than it was prior to remote work. The use of collaborative digital platforms has increased substantially.And from a pulse survey of just a week ago, employee engagement is actually up at this moment relative to our customary high levels. And our customers continue to engage with our analytics and insights as visits to our portals across our three segments have increased as well. Second, we've been active in bringing new value to our customers in the COVID-19 moment. In the insurance space, we have provided an innovative platform to claims departments, allowing them to settle claims in direct collaboration with insureds without requiring physical presence.We made this platform free of charge as a form of support and look for it to become another subscription offering with high acceptance across the industry over time. Our pandemic model, a part of the AIR suite has drawn intense interest, and slices of the output from the model have been made available to customers again at no cost. In financial services, we have created a COVID-19 dashboard for our banking customers to help them see precisely the real-time changes in spending across industry categories, thereby helping them anticipate movement in the creditworthiness of their commercial customers. And in the energy vertical, through a hurry-up six week effort, our customers can now examine the vulnerability of their supply chains in light of a geographic analysis of where the virus has had its greatest impacts.I'm very proud of the work of all my teammates. Third, we've analyzed all our solutions and services to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our revenue streams. We have not identified any material impact of COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our revenues at this point, as much of these revenues are subscription in nature and subject to long-term contracts. We have also identified that COVID-19 is impacting about 5% of our people who have seen their work curtailed, to some degree, in the following categories: our survey teams which diligence the engineering features of commercial buildings for the purpose of supporting commercial property underwriting, have not been able to enter most commercial buildings during the lockdown and, even with repurposing their time, remain at the moment less than fully utilized.Our consulting teams across the company, and especially in the energy vertical, have seen some reductions to their current and projected billable activities for the immediate term. And our team focused on supporting auto claims adjusting in the U.K. have seen claims volumes drop as fewer miles are driven in the lockdown period. Across these few places in the company where the macro environment has reduced the workloads, we are working to reallocate these resources to other growing areas of the business.When necessary, we are using a combination of four day work weeks, moderate trimming of team size and a small amount of furloughing to keep the work and team in balance. And finally, we continue to make good sales progress as we have adjusted quickly to engaging digitally with our customers. The rate of sales closure has slowed modestly, though pipelines remained strong, implying that we could experience some timing effects measured in weeks to months for new sales. Despite the distractions of COVID-19, I want to note our ongoing focus and progress with the integration of several recent acquisitions including Genscape, FAST, BuildFax, and the 3E acquisition of SAP's Content as a Service business.We are very pleased in the integration -- we are pleased with the integration momentum, synergy realization and early business results we have achieved at these entities, consistent with our expectations and supporting solid returns on the capital we've invested. For the balance of today's call, we will focus on our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk. Mark and Lee will take you through our view in detail, but let me paint the general picture for you. Our priorities for investing in our business and our people are unchanged, evidenced by our reiteration of our capex budget for the year.We are continuing to drive our innovation agenda and invest in our business, while also advancing on our move to the cloud. With respect to performance, we expect to realize the benefit of four key features of our resilient business model: first, continued growth in data sets and demand for analytics from our clients that remains unchanged in the long-term and continues to drive our performance; second, a high proportion and broad diversification of subscription revenues that provide exceptional stability to our revenue; third, operations that provide significant flexibility in managing our expenses; and fourth, strong free cash flow generation and access to capital which enable us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders. On that topic, I'm pleased to report that our board of directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the second quarter to be paid in June. Our business model has proven its resiliency in the past, delivering stable performance through the financial crisis and the last oil price shocks.We realize that no two events are the same, but we have confidence that we can deliver growth again through COVID-19. And while there may be some short-term headwinds to growth, we believe our performance will reflect our long-term goal of growing EBITDA faster than revenue. Finally, on a personal note, I sympathize with the small businesses that are unable to operate during these challenging times, and every one of our customers in this situation can expect the full support of our company. I also feel extremely fortunate to be a part of Verisk's business model.Now, I will turn the call over to Mark to walk you through developments in our insurance vertical. -- Thank you Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in insurance, with all businesses contributing to growth. Despite some reduced volumes in March due to the pandemic organic constant currency revenue growth was 5.9%. After normalizing for the continued impact of the injunction on our roof measurement solution organic constant currency growth was 6.9%, fueled by market-leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement.Across our insurance businesses, our retention rates remain very high, and we have seen increased customer engagement during these unique times. Our customers have effectively transitioned to working from home and are more available and open the calls and product demos. Since March 15, we've seen customer call reports grow significantly from 2019 levels and realized a surge in participants at our virtual industry events focused on business interruption coverage, fraud during the pandemic, virtual claims handling and virtual property underwriting. The effectiveness of our team is essential in maintaining great service to our customers.Our knowledge-based solutions allow us to service customers remotely and with continuity. Our cloud-first approach has fostered a technical infrastructure that is available, scalable and resilient, allowing for uninterrupted service to customers as well as employees. As an example of our preparedness, we had a major customer perform a review of Verisk infrastructure to assure -- ensure that all -- ongoing technical support for their operations during these unique times. The feedback was extremely positive, with the customer sharing that Verisk was well prepared ahead of their own internal infrastructure and followed several best practices that they plan to replicate.Let me share an industry perspective and its impact on our business. Insurance coverage remains essential through this pandemic and insurance renewals continue. I doubt any participants joining this call have thought about canceling their homeowners or automobile insurance policies. However, driving is down significantly.Our telematics data exchange indicates that driving mileage is down almost 50% year over year in the U.S. since the pandemic breakout, leading to reduced auto claims. But we've seen a rebound in mileage in recent weeks, leading us to believe that bottom occurred in late March and early April. Some insurers have committed to premium refunds which have contributed to a reduction in shopping for lower premiums by policyholders.Other areas of weakness in the industry includes a significant drop in travel insurance and more modest declines in commercial insurance. Over the immediate term, total exposure values in commercial insurance may be reduced. Our insurance business benefits from subscriptions and long-term contracts, with the small portions of revenue transaction. Although modest, we expect to see some adverse impacts from the pandemic in certain of our transactional revenues.As I highlighted in my opening, customer engagement has been very strong. Let me share a few examples. We continue to see great success and market share gains in extreme event modeling as customers are moving toward AIR's suite of solutions. To support our customers, we've made our pandemic forecasting tool available for free to the insurance industry, as well as the general public, to assist in planning and refinancing.As Scott mentioned in his opening, we made our virtual claims adjudication and virtual inspection platforms available for free to customers to stay in business and to facilitate the timely payment of insurance claims. Over 30,000 adjusters and inspectors now have access to the platform. Since rolling out the program in mid-March, more than 1,100 customers with many more users have enrolled. We have received very positive feedback from insurers, thanking us for our contribution to the industry.And last, but certainly not least, we've received strong interest in our life insurance analytics solutions. The FAST technology and strong leadership team, in combination with Verisk advanced analytics and reputation in the insurance industry, has created significant opportunities. We have signed noteworthy contracts with Amica, Lincoln Heritage, Pacific Life, M Financial and partnered with SCOR on our life analytics platform. I'm pleased with the strong early results as evidence of the synergies and strategic benefits.In a period of an -- heightened security, data analytics are more important than ever, and further, with substantially increased remote operations, the connectivity we provide our clients is critically valuable to our industry, supporting in turn the value of Verisk's business. With that, let me turn it over to Lee to cover our financial results. -- Thank you Mark. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10% to $690 million, while net income increased 28% to $172 million.Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 28% to $1.04 for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of organic growth in the business, gains from dispositions and a decrease in acquisition-related costs. These increases were offset in part by the previously communicated timing shift of a $10 million expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants that was recognized in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter in the prior year. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the Non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release.We believe our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 5% for the first quarter of 2020. All three segments delivered growth, with insurance posting the strongest growth rates. We did experience a decline in certain of our transactional revenues during the last two weeks of March related to COVID-19, though the impact on the first-quarter results overall was modest.Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.4% reflecting operating leverage despite a headwind from the timing shift of annual LTI grants. Normalizing for the $4 million revenue impact of the injunction, revenue grew 5.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on an organic constant currency basis. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.1%, down 59 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the impact of the timing shift of annual LTI grants however total adjusted EBITDA margin would have expanded to 47.5%, demonstrating solid adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, inclusive of continued investment in our breakout opportunities.This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA.On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 5.9% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 8% for the quarter. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions, offset by the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction, insurance would have achieved 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 9.9% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating margin expansion while also investing for future growth.Energy and specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 2.6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.8% for the quarter. Driven by increases in core research and the breakout areas, like the energy transition practice and chemicals, we also saw increases in our environmental health and safety service revenues and weather analytics revenues. These increases were partially offset by declines in core consulting related to lower capital expenditures across the energy sector as well as the completion of implementation projects in market and cost intelligence solutions resulting from an exceptionally strong 2019 that reduced related transactional revenue. Financial services grew 3% and adjusted EBITDA increased 15.9% in the quarter driven by growth in management information and regulatory reporting as well as fraud and credit risk, and offset in part by declines in portfolio management and spend-informed analytics revenues.Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% for the quarter compared to 21% in the prior-year quarter. We continue to believe that our tax rate for 2020 will be between 19% and 21%, though likely at the higher end of the range. There will likely be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. In addition, we are closely monitoring potential tax legislation in the U.K.which could impact our future tax rates. Adjusted net income was $194 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the first quarter of 2020, up 13.6% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $363 million for the quarter, down 1% from the prior period.Capital expenditures were $53 million for the quarter, up 17% from the prior-year period. Capex represented 7.7% of total revenues in the quarter. We continue to believe that capex will be in the range of $250 million to $270 million for 2020 as investing in our business and our people continues to be our highest priority. That said, certain expenditures related to real estate projects could be further delayed because of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but it is too early to quantify the impact, if any.Free cash flow was $310 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3.5% from the prior-year period primarily due to an increase in interest payments and the timing of certain customer collections and operating expense payments. In light of the current environment, we are monitoring our cash flow closely. And in that regard, year-to-date through the end of April, we have seen year-over-year growth in both cash receipts and cash flow after operational expenditures including capex. During the quarter, we returned $218 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.And the Verisk board of directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.27 per share, payable on June 30, 2020. Moving from the results of the quarter to our broader exposure to COVID-19, I wanted to address a few key elements related to our financial performance. With regard to revenues, as Scott described, we have completed a careful review of our solutions and services to evaluate their potential exposure to COVID-19 impacts. Through that exercise, we have identified specific products and services, largely transactional in nature, that are being impacted by COVID-19.Collectively, these solutions represent approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. And at the segment level, the 15% consists of approximately 8% in Insurance, 4% in energy and specialized markets and 3% in financial services. On the 15%, we have identified specific solutions and services that are being impacted to various degrees by primary causal factors including lower auto and travel insurance activity, the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analysis, decreased capital expenditures in the energy sector and reduced levels of advertising by financial institutions and marketers. A portion of the revenue attributable to these solutions could be negatively impacted by COVID-19.The impact on many of these solutions is expected to be modest, with the deepest impacts felt in the categories of travel insurance analytics, auto underwriting and claims analytics, consulting services to the energy industry and spend-informed analytics solutions in financial services. Although we experienced a decline in revenue attributable to these specific solutions in the last two weeks of March 2020, the impact on the first quarter was modest. We do not anticipate lasting impacts of a material nature to our long-term growth profile. And as the global outbreak of COVID-19 is still rapidly evolving, we will continue to monitor its impact on our business.It's important to understand that the aggregate 15% is not what we expect the impact on our revenues to be, but rather, it is the portion of revenue that we believe could be affected by the causal factors generated by COVID-19. Two observations. This should not be surprising as it is primarily a subset of our total transactional revenues which represent about 20% of our total revenues. Of the transactional revenues included in the identified 15%, it should be noted that they are diverse in the nature of their exposure and generally are expected to show strong resilience and recovery.In addition, it reinforces the stability of our subscription revenues that make up the bulk of the 85% of revenues, for which we were unable to identify an exposure at this time. Of course, depending upon the duration of COVID-19, we may see new contract signing or renewal delays, but we view these as primarily timing issues. With regard to energy and specialized markets, while it's natural to draw comparisons to Wood Mackenzie's experience during significant oil price declines in 2016, it is important to understand both that one, Wood Mackenzie has reduced its exposure to the more oil price-sensitive upstream oil companies through the growth of its energy transition practice, chemicals and other subsegments and its limited revenue contribution from the Lower 48 U.S. operators.Secondly, Wood Mackenzie represents a smaller percentage of our energy and specialized markets segment primarily as the result of our acquisition of PowerAdvocate which primarily serves the utility subsegment, and our environmental health and safety business which has limited commodity exposure. The collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objectives in 2020, but we don't believe they represent any structural changes in our fundamental growth drivers or operating leverage that would limit our ability to return to delivering on the long-term growth expectations for the business. Moving to expenses. I want to emphasize our ability to manage the cost structure.First, our short-term incentive compensation is directly tied to revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and will automatically reduce our expenses at lower growth rates. Second, we have already slowed our rate of head count growth and will continue to manage head count growth carefully through the COVID-19 event. With compensation representing approximately 70% of our cost base and head count growth representing a meaningful component of expense growth, this discipline provides significant flexibility. Finally, we are reducing noncompensation expenses including travel and entertainment, event and other nonessential expenses.What we are not cutting is investment in the business. We will continue our target of $250 million to $270 million for capital expenditure in 2020, and we will continue to invest in our breakout solutions as they are fundamental to our growth and value-creation opportunity. We also remain pleased, as Scott has described, with our integration progress on recent acquisitions, where our focus on realizing synergies and generating attractive returns remains undiminished. Factoring all of the above on revenues and expenses, we recognize the challenges this environment presents, but we believe the stability of our subscription revenues, our core operating leverage and expense actions we are taking, will continue to support our revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020.While the impact of COVID-19 on first-quarter results was modest, the second quarter will bear a larger impact from the causal factors reflecting the more significant duration and effect of COVID-19 for the period. As and when the causal factors diminish, we expect the impact to abate. From a capital and liquidity perspective, we continue to anticipate solid operating cash flow and capital generation from our business. We maintain access to our committed revolving credit line, with approximately $595 million in currently available capacity, as well as access to the investment-grade debt markets.And we have staggered maturities with no debt maturing until May 2021. We expect to continue to manage our leverage within our typical two to three times range. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk.Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Thanks very much. Glad you guys are safe and well. I wanted to ask about the energy business. I know in the past I guess when the price of oil gets below a certain level and now it's in the 20s I guess how much of an impact should we be expecting on the business? I know you mentioned you have less exposure to upstream now versus in 2015, '16.I think it was about 80% then. If you could give us the updated percent upstream now. But just I guess how can -- like where can you see the impacts from this lower oil price? Can customers change their contracts during the subscription term or need to wait for renewal? Just any sort of color on the energy business would be helpful. Thank you. -- Yeah. Toni, thanks for the question and thanks for your well wishes, and the same to you and to everybody who's with us on this call today. I hope everybody is safe and well. So first of all, to your factual question, the percentage of WoodMac business that was upstream was roughly in the neighborhood of the number you just cited, and now it's below 50%.The other thing that I would say is that, as Lee mentioned, we have really diversified the revenues associated with the energy vertical. We do much more now with utilities which are proving to be relatively stable and definitely relatively more stable than oil and gas companies are at the moment. The whole wing of our business which is aimed at helping with the transition to the renewables, is in very good shape. One part of the world that benefits from a low petroleum price is the petrochemicals business, and that is also a material part of what we do.So as you started, our business is actually different than it was the last time we went through an oil price shock.Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Yeah. Hey. Good morning everyone. You mentioned the very modest impact in the last two weeks of March.Can you be a little bit more specific what you've seen so far in April? I think Mark mentioned something about the lower auto claims which is pretty obvious, but I think they may have bottomed, as you said. But any other things you can highlight, maybe a little bit more specifically, how big the impact was in April so far? Thank you. -- So let me characterize generally, and then, Lee, let come to you. So everything that we've said in our call today is a product of having examined very carefully what happened in April. So all of the statements that we've made here about our view of 2020 and what it is that we've done by way of preparation -- April is fully in mind when we've made every one of those statements. Lee, anything you want to add to that? -- Yeah. Alex, thanks for the question. It certainly is something that we're watching carefully. And I think a couple of comments.One, I think it's important to understand that, in the 15% of the impacted products, there's a lot of diversity in that. And so you have different products that are having different effects across that, and that provides some stability within that. The second is that, while we're looking at April, we also have to take into account kind of the temporal dynamic of the duration of COVID-19 and its impact over time. And so we want to be -- certainly, our expectation is that that impact is going to moderate over some period of time.So with all that being said, on the 15% that we identified, we did see the expected decline, a partial decline in those revenues on a year-over-year basis in April and with fairly good degree of predictability. But in the non-COVID-19 revenues we saw are more typical growth rates. And overall, as we indicated, we still saw growth in revenues across the business as a whole, factoring those two elements in. So beyond that, we're not in a position to predict, given the complexity, given the impact of the duration.But I think, within April, with that full impact, we saw that partial decline, but overall, we still maintained growth in the revenue so far.Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Good morning. Hope you guys are safe and healthy as well. My question is on the international side of the insurance segment. It feels like you've been doing some M&A there and essentially been utilizing software platforms to target customers.Could you maybe talk a little bit more about that strategy? And how much of your business today is purely software? And any margin implications with regard to that? -- Mark, would you take that question, please? -- Yeah. Thank you very much. So what we've been able to do in the United States is, over time, aggregate a huge amount of data to build out some unique and proprietary analytic objects, analytics solutions. Inside of our international strategy obviously we have this ambition, as we always do, to aggregate some unique data.But to do that, we had to kind of look toward solutions that can help us aggregate the data. So in some cases, we have some, I'll call it, natural catastrophe or hazard-type information that we can use and pull across that we've done and kind of replicated from what we've been successful at in the United States. At the same time, we found the best way to aggregate some information is really from a software angle. So with a goal toward -- driving toward an analytic outcome and providing solutions that are analytic at the foundation, we have done two things.We've started to aggregate data where we can, and we've also kind of taken a software approach to things that help us, for the most part, aggregate that same data. I think what we have found, to be honest, is inside the U.K., there is more of a thirst for a solution set, that is an ecosystem interconnected across a lot of solutions. I think that drives automation. That drives digital engagement.So our focus has been to try to take some software componentry kind of create this ecosystem to help customers and, along the way, aggregate some data and, with that data, build out an analytic outcome. It's kind of where you start, and that's how we've gotten it to the markets. And I think we've been very happy with the success and progress we've made, particularly in the U.K. As you referenced, we have a little bit more of a beachhead there.We have, certainly, some more assets. And those assets have been working very closely together to integrate things that are related to data, underwriting workflow and cat modeling or what I'll call for both reinsurers and insurers. So thanks for the question, and I think your observation was accurate. Hopefully, that gave it a little color.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Hi. Scott, in your prepared remarks, you indicated Verisk is confident that we'll continue to deliver revenue growth during this COVID period. And then your next sentence highlighted that the company is targeting EBITDA growth faster than revenue. And I wondered -- my question is I wondered if we're supposed to link those two comments together or specifically, is the company targeting EBITDA growth faster than revenue growth during this COVID period, and if that dynamic is on a reported basis or just an organic EBITDA basis? -- Yeah. So thank you, Andrew. Good to hear your voice. So first of all, you are correct that those two statements are intended to stand together.They are part of a full thought in terms of our bottom-line performance. And we have been addressing ourselves in this call to COVID-19 effects which more or less also correlates with statements about 2020. But the ambition in terms of the long term also remains the same, and that is that our -- that we would have very healthy rates of organic revenue growth, and we would have rates of organic EBITDA growth that exceed rates of organic revenue growth. So we're stating, once again, what our long-term plan is.So my comments were specific to 2020. The general point remains for our business over the long term. And then lastly, to your question, we are talking about both organic and reported.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Hi. Good morning. In hearing from some of the insurtech players over the past couple of months, it certainly seems like they've seen increased demand in the new environment. I'm just wondering if your conversations with those partners have evolved at all, of late, and whether your view of the group's long-term trajectory has changed as a consequence of recent activity. -- Mark, would you please take that question? -- Absolutely. So once again, I think we differentiate the two types of insurtechs. There's an insurtech, and that definition really relates to those that want to be insurers or managing general agents. It's about distribution.And I think what we've seen there is those continue to prosper. At the same time, many of those early start-ups who have decided to actually be underwriters or actually carry risk, sometimes those, I'll call it, loss ratios have been a little higher. The combined ratio, it has not been as profitable. So we think they will continue, but we have seen some pressure because all of a sudden becomes a focus on liquidity and maybe turning to profitability a little bit sooner.So we are watching our insurtech customers, and we are trying to help them out with everything we can. And I think it's a little bit of a mixed answer, dependent upon where they are on their own life cycle as they evolve to a more profitable kind of entity. The other type of insurtech is really the service provider. And in some cases, those service providers are partners with us.Sometimes they compete in part with us. And again, I think it really relates to what they are doing. There's a definite need in the industry to help bridge the gap between the insurer and the policyholder because I can't be necessarily face-to-face. I can't be at the home.I can't be at the property. So like we referenced in some of the work that we're doing with our virtual property adjudication process and our underwriting platforms, those have been in widespread use and needs. So I think those players have reacted and certainly done well during this pandemic. In other cases, I think probably there's a little bit of hesitancy around what can I actually implement during these times, what do I want to buy? And then, like any Insurance Act, the smaller ones, it becomes a little bit of a liquidity issue as to how much cash I have and what state I am along the dilution toward profitability.So kind of a mixed message there. And obviously, we've grown nicely through a lot of those insurtech insurers or MGAs, and we're trying to support them during these difficult times.Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Thank you. Good morning. I just -- underpinning -- trying to better understand what underpins the response to Andrew's question about the expected organic margin expansion this year and trying to understand the trend that you go into COVID with. The margin expansion in Q1 looked quite good, especially in the Insurance segment, but really across the business.Can you just give us a bit more detail on what drove that and -- so we can understand the baseline you go into COVID with? Thanks. -- Sure. So let me start, and Lee, perhaps you'd like to add some detail. But fundamentally, Jeff -- and Jeff, good to hear your voice, and hope you're doing well. -- Likewise. -- Thank you. So a very substantial fraction of our cost structure is the cost of our people, our team. It runs at about 70% of our total. As Lee mentioned, one dimension of our compensation stack is our incentive compensation.And those of you who have observed what we have in the proxy, we have set the -- sort of the baseline expectation for performance in that at the level of our long-term targets for organic revenue and EBITDA growth. In other words, I would say that we have set the bar at a pretty high level. And to the extent that this moment, for the reasons that we talked about, put some pressure I would say particularly on the top line at this moment, one of the natural adjustments which occurs inside of our compensation is that the amount of annual incentive that will get paid out logically would come down somewhat, and that's automatic. That's just in the design of what we do.The other thing that matters greatly here is our total head count, and there's two ideas that are paired one with the other. So one is, as Lee mentioned, our rate of investment in innovation for the future is unabated. Our expectations are that we will spend as much writing and capitalizing software in 2020 as we originally intended, and we spoke to that. But the other part of it is what is happening with respect to the rate of head count growth.And let me put that alongside of the comment that I made earlier. They're very -- it is an extremely small fraction of our team, where, in this moment, their ability to get their work on is limited. I mentioned roughly 5%. And even in those cases, we've -- I would describe what we've done as a very modest amount of sort of trimming and realigning.So these are relatively small effects. The larger effect is that, as you've seen our company do over time, entering into 2020, we were also planning on a pretty substantial increase in head count in order to provide even more acceleration of our developments into the future. And as we got the sense that the COVID-19 effect was going to be global, not just regional, we basically moved very aggressively to -- not to let people go but simply to slow down in this moment the rate of hiring. And it actually has a material effect on the rate at which our expenses move.And so essentially, we have already done what I think of as the most substantially important thing that we need to do in order to be in position to see our rate of EBITDA growth exceed our rate of revenue growth. Lee, anything you'd like to add to that? -- Very little, Scott because I think you described the mechanics in terms of the steps that we're taking in this environment and how that's affecting our ability to manage EBITDA. And maybe just to kind of give some context, as I have in the past, around the components and their impact. So in this quarter, Jeff, as I think you identified, and I kind of presume in your analysis, you're eliminating that impact of the LTI shift. But within that, we're seeing before the impact of M&A and even before the impact of the Geomni-Vexcel transaction, solid EBITDA margin expansion within each of the three verticals individually.And so that's generating a strong base of margin expansion. The Geomni impact, the reduction of expenses from that transaction is very helpful. And then we have the impact of LTI, that LTI shift in M&A. But within the business, we do have that ongoing core operating leverage.And everything that Scott is describing our ability to continue to manage and deliver that core operating leverage which serves to achieve and support both at organic and all-in margin objective that Andrew asked about originally.Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Thank you. Good morning. Scott, maybe just to follow-up on your comments you just made on plans to accelerate in 2020. I was just wondering if maybe it's early, but in terms of conversations with your clients, this thesis that maybe everyone realizes they need to be -- accelerate their digital plans and so forth.So in the context of opportunity, once the dust settles, how do you think about whether that's lens or insurance and telematics or whatever like, where could things really pick up after this because of what's happening? -- Yeah. Thank you, Manav. Nice to hear your voice, and I hope you're doing well. Yes.You've really put your finger on one of the most fundamental things about the context in which Verisk does its business. And that is, fundamentally, as our customers become what I refer to as the better digital version of themselves, that's good for us. That means that they are more able to consume the data and the analytics that we put out. They're more -- and they are able to actually realize and acknowledge the value that they get, not that there's any lack of acknowledgment today.But as their own processes become more data-aware and data-sensitive and fast, the precision that our analytics bring and the speed with which we do what we do just becomes that much more active inside of their own environment. And I believe that one of the most fundamental consequences of the COVID-19 moment is that it's going to accelerate companies becoming the better digital version of themselves. Now there's still a long distance to go. I mean for all the discussion that is out there in terms of digital business, digital migration, etc.I would say that many companies are still at relatively early stages. But I do believe that there's going to be an acceleration effect based upon what's going on here. What does that mean specifically? I think what that means specifically is that customers will, across a variety of different attachment points, find even more interest in what it is we do. So analytic objects that we put out will be more consumable.And therefore, when our customers write their own business cases for making use of the next thing from Verisk that they haven't made use of yet, one of the factors that will be at work there is when they think about their own returns. They will be able to generate returns faster because they will actually get to implementation of what we do more quickly. Same relates to if they want to attach to an API that we put out there in order to access some of our content. The more that they do business that way, the more they will be able to go from the concept to the actual use of our solutions more quickly.And I would not localize these effects to any one part of our business. All three of the verticals, virtually everything that we do, will respond to this trend.Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Good morning everyone. So a question for you on WoodMac. Maybe you could talk a little bit about whether there's seasonality of renewals for GEM. And maybe you could give us some sense for what you're seeing on renewals an early read.Thanks. -- Bill, good to hear your voice. Hope you're doing well. -- Thank you. -- There is a degree of seasonality. And most of the -- or, in many cases, the heaviest season for renewals is Q4 and Q1. So obviously, we just had our Q1. And the team is in the marketplace.I mean one of the wonderful things about what we do, not only there, but actually across the whole company, is the degree of intimacy we have with our customers. So a sales call is not only a sales call. A sales call is a relationship moment. It is -- and particularly, at this time, the exchange with our customers is obviously at a very fundamental level.We're very interested in how they're doing. We're very interested in what can we do to be of support to them. And I believe that our customers really get that about Verisk right now. They really get that.And I believe that that, in addition to the acceleration of business becoming more digital, I believe both of those will be resonant for long periods of time into the future, that customers will remember this moment and they will remember what Verisk did. We recited several things where, not only did we develop things in a very hurry-up fashion in order to respond to their interest, but we also, in some cases, made things available for them for free. And I believe that all of that is going to be remembered. And we'll be -- we'll hopefully be -- get more foundation inside of the relationships we have with our customers.That's true at WoodMac also. One of the things about WoodMac being out in the marketplace at this moment seeking renewals is that we are equipped in a way that we weren't in the past. Certainly, it's very different than when the oil price shock of '15 and '16 occurred because we now have the Lens platform which is a very nice platform to analytic environment that customers -- the value of it is obvious to customers. And so it's an amplification of the value that they've always gotten out of our content.And so there's a -- we're able to lean into the discussion -- even while we're listening very carefully to where the customers are. We're able to lean into the discussion with respect to affirming the value of what we bring and affirming the increase in the value of what we bring relative to, say, the past renewal, if it was three years ago or two years ago or whenever it happened to be. And so there's a -- I would describe it as kind of a quiet confidence when our team goes out into the market. Now they know that they've got the goods, and they're determined to represent that value even at the same time that we're trying to be very sensitive to where the customers are.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to your insurance vertical. I know it's about 85% subscription, I think that's what you said, and you've got long-term contracts. But I'm just curious if you think you might be seeing any pressure on any of those clients, whether it's lower returns from their own investment portfolios, higher business interruption insurance claims.And then also, can you talk about the percentage of contracts that come up for renewal each year and roughly what the seasonality there is as well? Thanks. -- Yes. So I'll start with that, and Mark, and then I'll turn it over to you. Just a couple of your points. I mean, insurers are not unaffected by what is happening at the moment, for sure.And Mark described some of the dynamics, particularly the fact that probably the single most observable in-the-moment effects are related to reduced use of automobiles and, therefore, reduced damage to automobile, lower claims. And Mark pointed out earlier that a good number of our customers have chosen to reflect this in premium rebates to some of their customers. But that doesn't mean that they're necessarily -- or that our customers, the insurers are going to make less money on the line. I mean there are claims experiences.Half of the combined ratio has just gone down quite a bit in the moment. So I think they're being very realistic in reflecting that in how they deal with their own customers. But that aside, there will definitely be a discussion about what does business interruption insurance cover and not cover and, specifically, our pandemic effects excluded. Our reading of the policy language is that it's relatively clear that pandemic effects are excluded.That doesn't mean that there will be less than maybe a spirited dialogue in front of judges and juries with folks wanting to claim. Well, yes, but no, the policy really should cover that. And of course, we also have to sort of wait and see where public policymaking comes out on all of this. But the industry will certainly make its case in terms of the -- what is included and what is excluded in the policy language.Mark also talked about some of the smaller companies. And I would just add to what Mark said earlier that one of the things that we -- there's a hallmark, actually, of how we work with our customers, is we try to be very flexible to meet them where they are. And so we're open, for example, to -- if they're feeling -- and this is not most cases, in fact, this is very few cases. But if they're under a relatively greater level of pressure at the moment, we might offer sort of a little relief in the moment for an extended contract, with better terms in the out years.We don't find ourselves needing to do that very much, but we're trying to be flexible in those few cases where that makes sense. A lot of our business is on multi-year subscription. Some of it is one year, but actually automatically renewing. And so Lee mentioned multiple times the extreme stability of our subscription base revenues.And that's where it is basically found, it's either multiyear or it's automatically renewing. And all of it is so basic to what our customers are doing, that it really does fall into the category of must-haves. So Mark, anything you want to add to that? -- I think you covered it well, Scott. The contracts we have are typically like three years in nature. So there's no necessary -- necessarily a concentration, maybe just a little bit more fourth-quarter windows are signed but that's over three years. Thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please ask your question. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on M&A. You've done several tuck-in acquisitions and some divestitures over the last year -- few years.Given your solid balance sheet, how do you think about taking advantage of some of the market dislocation and doing more of these tuck-ins going forward? Any color on that front? Thanks. -- Yeah. So as I mentioned way back at the start of the call, we are talking within our leadership team on an extremely frequent basis. We always do, but even more so in this moment. There are two messages that I have for our leaders above all, and I'm almost a broken record on these points as we speak with one another, counsel with one another.One is that we need to be extraordinarily alert to cyber risk in this moment. This is a great moment for bad guys because companies potentially could be distracted as they're dealing with the effects of this moment. We always look very strongly to our defenses at Verisk. And -- but I am just asking for extraordinarily -- extraordinary alertness to that particular dimension of doing work.And by the way, all the monitoring that we do of our network definitely, definitely shows us that we remain secure. But we have to -- we just have to lean into it. That's one of my messages for our leadership team. And the other one is you work for a company that is very strong, very stable, has a very substantial and solid balance sheet, and that is not true of all companies in the world today.So please keep your radars on maximum frequency and reach in terms of observing companies that are around us that maybe are logical relative to something that we're doing inside of Verisk and that perhaps are or even more specifically, were making a difference for our customers. Because it is possible that some of them may find themselves in a situation where they need to think about a different way of proceeding into the future. And if it's -- and therefore, if both their strategic logic -- and there are terms which might be available, we should really be leaning into it at this moment. The message again is you -- to our leadership, this is me to our leaders, you work for a company that is unlike a lot of other companies, and this can be a moment.So with all of that said, if a company happens to be let's say in private equity hands, the private equity has, in quite a few cases, become the reference bidder inside of our world. So I'm not -- it remains to be seen just how much valuation expectations may modify downward. We'll see. -- Operator next question. -- Stacey, maybe we'll give it one more moment to see if the operator comes back online. -- Operator next question. Did we lose our operator? -- I think we may have. Well, why don't we tie it off there then. Thank you all very much for joining us today. And my apologies if there are any of you that were looking to ask a question but you didn't get a chance to get the question in due to this technical glitch.We don't have the ability to open and close the lines, that's only the operator. So apologies if you had a question, and you didn't get a chance to ask it. But in any event, as always, we will be following up with many, many of you. And I hope that you will take your additional questions and review them with Lee and Stacey.So otherwise, thank you very much for having been with us today. I want to wish you a great health and strength in this moment to you and your loved ones and your firms. And we really, really appreciate your interest in Verisk, and we have really been looking forward to having this conversation with you. So thanks very much for being with us today.Talk to you soon.

There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $144.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $190.00.  The standard deviation is $13.466.


But the whole reason to look at the average VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $165.43/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $165.43 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:

"Investors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 15th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new May 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $130.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $130.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $125.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $143.24/share today.

Because the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 81%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.77% return on the cash commitment, or 29.91% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $130.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $143.24/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.54% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.82% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.22% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 74%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 65%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $143.24) to be 34%.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Invesco QQQ ETF (Symbol: QQQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $233.54 per unit.


With QQQ trading at a recent price near $209.43 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.51% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of QQQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR), Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd. (Symbol: CHKP), and Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK). Although PCAR has traded at a recent price of $65.38/share, the average analyst target is 14.95% higher at $75.15/share. Similarly, CHKP has 12.69% upside from the recent share price of $102.10 if the average analyst target price of $115.06/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting VRSK to reach a target price of $165.36/share, which is 12.39% above the recent price of $147.13. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of PCAR, CHKP, and VRSK:

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"Investors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the September 18th expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $125.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $123.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $163.81/share today.

Because the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 24% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.88% return on the cash commitment, or 1.34% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $125.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $165.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $163.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $165.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.53% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $165.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $165.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.80% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.86% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 29%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 20%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $163.81) to be 15%.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q4 2019 , Good day everyone. And welcome to the Verisk fourth-quarter 2019 earnings results conference call. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk head of investor relations, Stacey Brodbar.Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead. -- Thank you Sarah. And good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's chairman, president, and chief executive officer, who will provide a brief overview of our business.Eric Schneider, chief technology officer, will then provide an update on our technology strategy including our cloud migration. Lastly, Lee Shavel, chief financial officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. Mark Anquillare, chief operating officer, will join the team for Q&A. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Verisk Analytics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The earnings release has been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.  -- Thanks Stacey. Good morning everyone. I'm pleased to share that '19 was another strong year for Verisk, marked by solid financial results while we continued to invest for future growth. Normalizing for the revenue impact of the injunction related to our root measurement solutions, we've delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.9% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.7%, demonstrating organic margin improvement in 2019.Moreover, our growth was driven by broad-based strength across our insurance vertical and marked improvement in energy and specialized markets. The consistency of our growth comes from four sources: first, intimacy with our customers; second, ever deeper levels of integration between our solutions and their environments; third, a steady stream of innovative new solutions; and fourth, the cross-sell of existing solutions to existing customers. Within insurance, we continue to enjoy strong market uptake of our platform to analytic environments including LightSpeed for automated underwriting and Touchstone for catastrophe modeling. These solutions are being well received by both the traditional P&C insurers as well as the InsurTech start-ups, who need data analytics to effectively price and sell in a competitive market.We've experienced great success with the InsurTech segment with more than 100 new sales wins in 2019 alone. Our energy and specialized markets segment delivered improved growth in 2019 driven by particularly strong results in our market and cost intelligence solutions as well as improvements within our core research at Wood Mackenzie. In addition, we delivered strong top-line growth and improving profitability from our breakout areas including the lens platform and our chemicals and energy transition solutions. As always, we are in close conversation with our customers as they navigate the near-term macro environment.In financial services, 2019 was a year of transition as we evolved from a tops-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth. Along that journey, we took a very deep look at all our solutions in Verisk financial solutions and concluded that our data hosting business, what we call Argus data warehouse, no longer aligns with our core business model. As such, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to transition the Argus data warehouse by transferring approximately 50 people and licensing our intellectual property to a partner so that we could focus on data analytics. We believe this transaction will position the financial services segment for stronger growth and higher levels of profitability going forward.Continuing on the strategic front on February 1, Verisk closed on the previously announced sale of our aerial imagery sourcing group to Vexcel Group. This transforms Geomni into an asset-light operation with a focus on advanced data analytics. Moreover, it meaningfully reduces the cost structure of our Geomni business while giving us access to the leading U.S. image library along with favorable economics.Regarding our roof measurement solution, we have applied for a patent on our new technology for roof measurement while continuing with our plan to appeal the recent court decision. On February 14, we closed on the sale of our compliance background screening business. This business was in the claims subsegment of our insurance business. This transaction will allow us to continue to have access to this important data set but in a more capitally efficient manner.Together, these three portfolio changes are examples of how we are actively managing our mix of businesses to capitalize on our competitive advantages and stay close to our proven business model of offering platform to analytics solutions and unique analytic objects. These moves position Verisk for continued, long-term sustainable growth and improving returns on capital. On the strategic acquisition front, in December, we acquired FAST, a leading SaaS company for the life insurance and annuity industry. FAST offers a modular, flexible policy administration system that allows life insurance companies to modernize legacy systems in stages and without a large upfront capital commitment.It also provides a channel for Verisk to deliver our new analytic objects to the life insurance industry. Adding FAST to the Verisk portfolio is a strong step forward as we make advances into the life insurance market. The software intensity of our overall business has increased over the years, and we are excited about the opportunity for FAST software to deliver our analytics and embed more deeply into life insurance customers' workflows. I'm pleased with the early steps toward integration with FAST.Another key strategic initiative for Verisk is our journey to migrate to the cloud, what we refer to internally as cloud first. We have made significant progress on this campaign and are poised to keep the momentum going. When we first started this journey in earnest two years ago, we saw customer feedback and listened carefully to their concerns. Today, in all of my discussions with CEOs of our customers across all of our verticals, there's full support of our migration to the cloud as our customers realize the benefits of Verisk's faster pace of innovation and our ability to enter new geographies more quickly.Eric Schneider, our chief technology officer, will discuss with you in more detail our cloud migration and broader technology strategy. 2019 was also a milestone year for our ESG objectives. We became a participant in the UN Global Compact, the world's largest sustainability initiative which encourages companies to align their operations and strategies around universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption. We view participation as an extension of the vision and principles represented by our Verisk way and an appropriate calling card as our business grows and embraces all geographies, cultures and people.Several Verisk businesses work with UN-sponsored initiatives addressing human rights and climate weather issues by contributing data analytics, professional insight and scientific expertise. Additionally, the Global Compact distinguishes Verisk with customers and prospects and sets an example for our suppliers and business partners. On the environmental front, we again reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project or CDP. And for the second consecutive year, we balanced 100% of our reported scope one and two emissions and scope three business air travel with the purchase of energy attribute certificates and carbon offsets.We're committed to reducing our emissions and have continued to do so through office consolidations, building improvements and greater data processing efficiency. In the fourth quarter, we named Pat McLaughlin as our chief sustainability officer, a first for Verisk, reporting directly to me. Pat and I have worked together for nearly 20 years. And in that time, Pat led a major business unit for us.His depth with the company gives him intimate knowledge of who we are and what we value. And so in 2014, I asked Pat to work with leadership and employees across Verisk to build a framework for understanding and addressing our impact on society including the environment. He is championing sustainability efforts across our operations and advancing initiatives for measuring and reporting Verisk in the context of sustainability. I would also like to publicly welcome Laura Ipsen to our board of directors.Laura joined us at the end of 2019 and brings with her more than 25 years of experience working as a technology executive at Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle, yielding a deep knowledge of the cloud, artificial intelligence and SaaS business models. Laura becomes the fourth women serving on Verisk's board of directors and also our fourth new director in the past five years. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved an 8% increase in our cash dividend to $0.27 per share this quarter and has also increased our share repurchase authorization by $500 million. These actions underscore confidence in the stability of our business, its profitability and its cash flows.Our core position within our three verticals is sound, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our strategies to drive long-term shareholder value as we focus on serving our customers while also investing in market-leading innovation and our people. So with that, let me turn it over to Eric to provide some insight into our technology strategy. -- Thank you Scott. Technology is mission-critical to our business. And as such, we are continually working to optimize our technology environment and are always striving to be best in class. Working in partnership with our business units, we have identified four strategic areas of equal importance, dedicating much of our focused energy to them as we believe these are the areas most impactful for driving growth and efficiency in our business.The four areas are: first, data stewardship; second, analytics; third, our cloud-first strategy that Scott referenced; and fourth, our people. I'd like to take a few minutes to describe each of these and what we are doing. Let me start with data stewardship. One of our key distinctives is our unique data assets as data is the core of everything we do.Within this area of strategic focus, we are advancing how we protect data, how we acquire new data assets and how we process data more efficiently. Our relentless focus on data stewardship continuously increases the usefulness of our data and analytics for our customers. To reach the next level, we recently added the role of chief data officer in each of our industry verticals. This role is responsible for driving our data agenda.Together, our three chief data officers are sharing best practices across verticals to amplify the value of our data. More specifically, the chief data officers are identifying new and valuable data assets, making our assets more usable, improving and unifying data stewardship, modernizing our data processing pipelines and standardizing data governance across the enterprise. For example, they champion the standardization and adoption of data protection methods like tokenization for sensitive information across our broad portfolio of products. For new data sets, our chief data officers discover and align both internal and partner data for valuable business applications.They are leading with cloud-based architectures to speed up data processing times for faster consumption by our customers. And finally, they continuously add higher quality data assets with more coverage, actively improve data quality and use cutting-edge techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning to link our data assets. Improved data assets with strong governance form the basis of our analytics portfolio which I would like to speak about next. On the analytics front, we are pushing the envelope by bringing advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to solve the business challenges facing our customers.We successfully partnered with regulators to enable the use of machine learning techniques to improve analytical outcomes. We are developing novel methods to leverage unstructured data sets, such as images and audio, in conjunction with our already differentiated structured data assets to further improve their value. Our AI and machine learning center of excellence, together with our business units, leverage our university partnerships to bring research and advanced techniques quickly and efficiently into our solutions for our customers. Our team's focused on accelerating our innovation process and leverage our analytics platform to explore scores of ideas through quick proofs of concepts, such that we are focusing our energies on ideas that quickly gain market traction.Now, let's turn to our cloud-first strategy. We are well under way on our journey to the cloud. We are multi cloud-enabled and have workloads running in all leading cloud providers. Approximately one-third of our compute environment is currently running in the cloud.Our multi-cloud strategy aligns our migration approach with our customer requirements when and where necessary, and the pace of our migration continues to meet our customers' expectations. We are leading the migration via our centralized cloud center of excellence which is offering advanced capabilities to our businesses in the areas of cloud architecture, financial management, security, operations and training. Each of our businesses in all three verticals actively engage and work closely with our center of excellence to ensure a secure, timely and cost-effective migration takes place. A significant benefit of our move to the cloud is our ability to reduce and forecast our compute costs.In the cloud, our unit costs are reduced and are linear, in lockstep with our utilization of cloud services. We are taking advantage of near infinite compute capacity by flexing and contracting in direct response to demand by both scaling horizontally for peak periods and contracting, turning environments off when not needed. Let me share an example of an environment we have moved from on-premise data centers to the cloud and the benefits we are realizing. Our telematics platform which houses over 100 billion miles of driving data, has been completely rearchitected to enhance the quality and timeliness of the analytic provided to our customers.By moving to the cloud, we have reduced processing cycle time while, at the same time, reducing costs, offering an overall improved experience for our customers or our telematics solutions. As we move forward, we will incur transitional costs associated with rearchitecting and optimizing our solutions to best benefit from cloud platforms. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly is our people. Our talent access is superior globally, and we continue to build and attract world-class talent in both our data science and cloud disciplines.Data scientists and cloud architects want to work with us because we have some of the most interesting business problems to solve, and we are doing so in the cloud. Our data science excellence program is an immersive 4-plus year rotational training program that brings the brightest talent from top schools to Verisk and exposes them to our customers' business challenges as meaningful contributors to our analytic teams. And from a cloud perspective, we are advancing the cloud skills of our people. Our teams have obtained hundreds of cloud certifications and we plan to double that number in 2020.In addition, we have augmented our internal teams by attracting experienced cloud professionals in the areas of cloud architecture, security and development operations. We continue to invest and optimize in all four of these strategic initiatives and are confident in the value they are bringing to our people, to our customers and to Verisk overall. Now let me turn the call over to Lee, who will provide an update on our financials. -- Thanks Eric. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.2% to $677 million.Net income decreased 9.6% to $132 million while diluted GAAP earnings per share decreased 8% to $0.80 for the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of acquisition-related earnout expenses of $28 million as many of our acquisitions are on target to achieve payments for strong performance. In addition, a higher effective tax rate due primarily to higher option exercises in the prior-year period related to expiring options associated with our IPO 10 years ago reduced net income and EPS in the quarter. Moving to our organic constant currency results.Adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we believe that our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant-currency basis, and including the impact of the injunction, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 5.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019. Growth was led by the energy and specialized markets segment which was our fastest-growing segment for the second consecutive quarter. insurance also delivered solid growth, while financial services results were stable.Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 9% reflecting leverage from organic growth across all three segments. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 47.1%, flat with the prior-year period including substantial investment. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Normalizing for the revenue impact of the injunction organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and total adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 47.5%.Moreover, on an organic basis and particularly on the pre-investment organic basis that we've discussed before, we saw margin expansion in all three of our segments, demonstrating the exceptional operating leverage at the core of our businesses. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant-currency basis. As you see in the press release, insurance reported 5.2% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 6.6% for the quarter. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction, insurance would have achieved 6.5% organic constant currency revenue growth and 9.1% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating margin expansion while also investing for future growth.Within our underwriting and rating business organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated to 8.2% and was very broad-based across our solution sets in personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, LightSpeed suite of products, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. We also had positive contributions from our international business. Within claims organic constant currency revenues declined 1% primarily driven by the injunction.Normalizing for the impact from the injunction, claims delivered 2.9% organic constant currency revenue growth, held back by fewer severe weather events this year as compared to last year, reducing transactional revenue growth. However, our claims subscription revenues continued to see solid growth and were primarily driven by claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions. Insurance adjusted EBITDA margin was 53% for the quarter, flat with the prior-year period. Normalizing for the impact from the injunction, the insurance segment adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 53.5% reflecting leverage from the organic growth, offset in part by continued investment.Energy and specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 7.1% for the quarter driven by particularly strong sales of our market and cost intelligence solutions and core research revenues as well as contributions from our chemicals, solutions and the energy transition practice. We also had positive contributions from environmental health and safety and weather and climate analytics revenues. Energy and specialized markets adjusted EBITDA increased 23.8% reflecting leverage on strong sales, balanced with ongoing investments in breakout opportunities including our lens platform, chemicals and the energy transition practice. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 32% from 30.8%.Financial services revenue grew 2.1% in the quarter, led by growth in fraud and credit risk management solutions as well as portfolio management solutions. This was offset in part by declines in enterprise data management revenues. As Scott discussed, we have decided to transition our data hosting operations to a partner which will better position this segment for more predictable, sustainable growth. As evidenced, the financial services segment would have delivered revenue growth of 7% in the quarter without the impact of the Argus data warehousing business.financial services segment adjusted EBITDA increased 6.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 40.3% from 37.9% reflecting strong cost discipline. Our reported effective tax rate was 23.2% for the quarter compared to 18.6% in the prior-year quarter primarily due to the impact of a higher level of option exercise in the prior-year period. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 20.9% which was in line with our targeted range. For 2020, we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.Though there will be likely some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personnel decisions. Adjusted net income was $188 million diluted adjusted EPS was $1.13 for the fourth quarter of 2019, up 8.7% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower average share count. These increases were offset in part by higher depreciation and amortization, increased interest expense and a higher effective tax rate.Net cash provided by operating activities was $176 million for the quarter, up 1.7% from the prior-year period reflecting primarily a higher effective tax rate due to the option exercises in 2018 mentioned earlier. Capital expenditures were $64 million for the quarter, down 16.3% from the prior-year period primarily the result of reduced capital expenditure at Geomni. Capex represented 9.5% of total revenue in the quarter. As we look to 2020, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million.Included in this number are one-time expenditures of approximately $35 million related to the consolidation of office space that we have planned in two key cities, London and Boston. We are excited about the long-term benefits of having our business units and people together under one roof. Related -- relating this to capex, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within a range of $170 million to $180 million in comparison to the $186 million for 2019. Depreciation and amortization should be lower year over year, helped by the sale of our imagery sourcing group including the planes and sensors to Vexcel.We expect intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020 in comparison to $138 million in 2019. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and completion of projects and future M&A activity. Free cash flow was $112 million for the quarter, an increase of 16% from the prior-year period primarily due to lower capital expenditures. During the fourth quarter, we returned $141 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at a weighted average price of $145.07 for a total cost of $100 million. At December 31, 2019, we had $128 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We remain committed to ongoing capital return to shareholders. And as Scott mentioned, we are pleased that Verisk's board of directors approved an additional authorization of $500 million for share repurchases as well as an 8% increase in our cash dividend to $0.27 per share this quarter.As Scott mentioned, we have recently engaged in a series of transactions that focus our portfolio of businesses to fully capitalize on our key distinctives and our core competitive advantages. Each of these transactions is unique in its structure, but share the motivation of active capital discipline and achieving more predictable long-term growth at Verisk. Before I conclude, and looking ahead to the first quarter, I want to inform you of a timing shift in expenses between the first and second quarters that will impact our reported financial results. The company recently changed the timing of the grant of long-term incentive compensation into the first quarter from the second quarter previously.This timing change aligns Verisk with a greater market and more closely timed employee compensation with calendar year results. The resulting impact will be increased expense of $10 million in the first quarter related to long-term incentive compensation, but that will reverse to a benefit in the second quarter. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term.We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts that we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may ask your question. -- Thank you. Good morning. My question is around the cloud-first strategy. So just kind of a two parter.So one, Scott, when you referenced, you were talking to your customers, and they are supportive of your move. Are the customers also sort of in this cloud move and are ready to adopt it or will there be a transition period of duplicate costs in order to serve the customer better? And then Lee, I was just hoping you could put some financial parameters around it, like how much of spend savings, etc.. we might start thinking about. -- Yeah. So I'll start with that Manav. Good morning. Our customers are in various stages of considering how they're going to manage their own technical infrastructure.I would say in general that our company has moved faster, probably considerably faster in modifying our compute environment relative to our customers, but it doesn't really create an added burden for our customers or put more costs into the system as we work with them. In fact, if anything, the interface between us and the customer becomes a little bit easier to manage. So there's no systemic increase in costs. We -- obviously as we've talked many times we are adding the cloud dimension to our business even as we are working to retire the premise dimension of our business.The premise dimension comes off sort of in shelves. The cloud sort of grows in a linear fashion, as Eric said before. But we've absorbed all that into our P&L and are just -- we continue to head in the same direction at the same pace. And so it all feels very organic.The customers, it's really nothing but good for customers, and it doesn't add an additional burden for them. And Lee, I don't know if you want to just talk a little bit more about the specifics. -- Sure. And Manav, thanks for the question. I appreciate that. Very simply, we aren't providing an estimate of the cost savings for a couple of reasons.One is that this is a multiyear project as we are rolling out these transitions across many data sets, many individual businesses. And while we're tracking it on each of those bases, and we look at each of those situations as test cases, where we can see the savings, we can see the return on capital for the investments that we're making, because of the rolling impact of us achieving some savings, investing in the transition over time, we don't want to create a fixed benchmark. I think from our perspective, our view is that this activity will generate both operational improvements in terms of lower opex relative to this function. And so there will be a margin benefit that supports our overall margin improvement objectives as well as EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth as well as capital efficiencies that will boost our return over time.But given that it is deeply embedded within our businesses and something that we're managing as part of their full technology spend, it's not something that at, an, aggregate level, we are going to provide kind of full estimates for that reason. But we absolutely have seen those benefits in the projects that we have executed within specific data sets in the businesses and we'll expect that to kind of roll forward as we prosecute this initiative over time. -- Next question.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. You may ask your question. -- Hi Lee. It's a margin question. So the fourth-quarter 2019 reported EBITDA margins were flat year over year. That's reported.That's including past acquisitions as well as the drag from the roof reported junction. You were good to say how much of that drag for the roof report injunction is. And also, we're seeing the operating leverage coming from the breakout initiatives at the core. So as such, is Verisk positioned to see 2020 reported EBITDA margins to be flattish to perhaps leaning forward? -- Yeah. So thank you Andrew. I appreciate the question and the consistent focus on margin. We bring the same discipline in looking at our overall business.So I appreciate the fact that what you've recognized is, at the core, we are generating very strong and consistent operating leverage in the businesses on a pre-investment basis. So in the fourth quarter, we did see that margin expansion for all of our core businesses before the impact of our breakouts which include Geomni as well as the impact from our acquisitions. And so we -- it certainly shouldn't come as a surprise that Geomni was a significant impact in terms of investment in the fourth quarter of 2019 as it was in -- for the year as a whole. And so that element will certainly benefit from the transaction with Vexcel.So at least that component in 2020 should have a substantially reduced impact overall on margins. But that's balanced then against of course the ongoing investment in our businesses that we make on a return basis as well as the impact from acquisitions. Our long-term objective continues to be to generate EBITDA growth in excess of revenue growth on an organic basis and to improve that margin over time. And I think going into 2020, we feel as confident as ever in our ability to achieve that. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. -- Thank you. Scott, just thinking about your strategy of getting out of the data collection and aerial imagery and also the data hosting business in Argus, it doesn't sound like your view on the value of data has changed, but maybe just some tangential ways of how you get the data and what you do with it is slightly changing. And so I just wanted to understand, like does the new partnership around the Argus data warehouse change anything with regard to the ownership of data and just how you're thinking of that? And then Lee, if you could give some additional color on the financial impacts like the net cost savings from the Vexcel transaction and how much revenue in total will be reduced by all the portfolio actions. Thank you. -- Yeah. Thanks, Toni. So first of all, our view of the value of unique data assets is completely unchanged. And actually, if anything, I think, going forward, unique data assets actually will be even probably more rare.Not that we feel that there is any -- there will be -- we will take any step back in terms of the volume or the value of the data that we've got. So our view of that as a part of our business is completely unchanged. Data remains the oxygen in our bloodstream, and it always will. So the two changes that we made, first of all, what I would really like to emphasize around the Vexcel transaction is that we actually put ourselves in position to have an even better data set.Vexcel was, as we've already described, already engaged in data capture. They're also one of the globe's leading providers of sensor technology. And so putting together our image capture process with their methods and some of the commitments they already had to creating this image library, we actually have access. We will have access, and we have access to a better set of images than we had before.And that substantially improved economics. So it's merely about how do we get to the data, not are we interested in the data? And with the move with the Argus data warehouse, that's a little bit different because the Argus data warehouse was not about our gathering of data from customers. It was really customers who had observed our facility with dealing with their data. And they said, can you essentially white label your way of managing data to me? And we said yes as another benefit for our customers.And what happened over time is this whole space of hosting data warehouses and particularly, cloud-enabled, has just sort of exploded over the last several years. And it was never founded -- the ADW work was never founded upon providing us a data source which we then translate through our analytics. It was really more of an accommodation for our customers in their own workflows. So there's really no change in terms -- well, there is 0 change in terms of our access to data in the financial segment.So we view data as we always have. We have as much or better access to data than we used to, and our economics have improved as a result of these changes that we made. Lee, anything you care to add to that? -- Yeah. Yup. Toni, to give you some sense that, from a financial impact standpoint, I understand you want to get a sense from a revenue perspective, that we would kind of roughly estimate approximately in the fourth quarter there were approximately $8 million of revenues associated with the image capture business that we'll be moving to Vexcel. So that gives you kind of some sense of the scale.From an EBITDA standpoint, there's not a material impact from the impact of those revenues. So kind of roughly equivalent level of EBITDA expense associated with that. But on a year-over-year basis, we are expecting a -- the benefit of eliminating the costs associated with the individuals and the flight operations associated with that image capture business that we will no longer continue to bear even though we will continue to have access to all of that data on very preferential terms looking ahead. So it will clearly be a benefit to us from an EBITDA perspective. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America. You may ask your question. -- Yeah. Thanks. Good morning guys. I wanted to ask just a bit more about the margins in the quarter.So a quarter ago, you'd talked about in the loss of revenue from the injunction not having enough time to really get at or reduce those costs, and yet the insurance margin was quite strong. So obviously, you're able to get rid of a bunch of that cost. And on the Energy business, we'd also thought there would be maybe more of a drag than it appeared there was from the Genscape deal that I think you owned for a couple of months in the quarter. So just help us think about, as we think moving into Q1 and moving forward, what the dilution from Genscape is and what -- how we think about the Geomni lost sales and the impact of that all in with Vexcel.Thank you. -- Yeah. Thank you Gary. So a lot of elements here, so let me try to give you a couple of components of that. So I think the statement that we made in the third quarter with regard to not being able to make substantial headway on the expense for Geomni in the fourth quarter is accurate kind of specific to the overall entity within our GAAP results.Naturally, the Vexcel transaction, we'll be moving a substantial part of that expense, not all of it. We will have operating expenses associated with our analytics component of that business that will be retained. But in excess of the majority of the expenses, we'll move out of the business. But the margin uplift within insurance really wasn't driven by cost savings within Geomni.I think it was just the natural operating leverage within the business as a whole. And specific to the energy and specialized markets discussion, there are market and cost intelligence business and the strong growth that we experienced within that business as well as cost discipline at Wood Mackenzie was really the primary contributor to the margin expansion within that business and for the business as a whole. And so there, we are benefiting from a very strong growth in that product and relatively low associated expense expansion within that. So I think that is when we looked at that margin strength, there were certainly some component of it within insurance, but a lot of that benefit came from those activities.So as I mentioned with regard to Andrew's comments, I think all of those effects, we think, will put us in a very good position to continue to work toward that margin expansion objective that we have over the long term in 2020. -- Thank you.Next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Hey good morning. Thank you. Historically, you guys have not talked a whole lot about your commercial sales organization on calls. Maybe just give us an update.Is that an opportunity? How do you measure sales force productivity? And any changes to incentives maybe that you've made there or haven't made as you look forward to growth? It seems like you're doing a lot of acquisitions around software to sort of penetrate customers but any thoughts as to adding salespeople and going after more revenues. Thank you. -- Yeah. So obviously, an important dimension of our business across all the verticals, we take a three tier approach to selling. So we have account representation, where there we have people who are owning our end-to-end relationship with our customer. Then we have product specialists, whether they be data analytics solutions or software solutions.Almost everything that we do is very technical. And so we do need people who are focused on specific parts of our product suite to go in, present credentials, work on issues of integration, etc. And then thirdly, we have inside sales to help us cover what, in some cases, is the fairly long tail of smaller customers inside of our market spaces. Generally, we find it a good use of money to expand our go-to-market team, and we're always looking to do that.And the only other thing I would say, and this ties a little bit to the point that Lee was just on, as we make acquisitions which are inside of verticals that we're already serving, one of the things we think hard about is, how are we going to integrate the 2? And I will say by the way that we had ambitious plans for Genscape integration. And the team has met all of their marks. And so it's gone very, very well. But one of the places where we're fairly slow to take any costs out actually is with respect to market representation.So as we say, integrate something that we acquire, we actually want to hold on to the go-to-market resources as much as we possibly can. And then we're always asking the question, would more be helpful? I mean in general I would just say that I've really been pleased and impressed with what our teams accomplished in 2019 in terms of building our book of business. So yes, it's always on our mind. We've always had the same structure.We always lean into more investment in that area when it makes sense. -- Thank you. -- Next question.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. You may ask your question. -- Yeah. Thank you with the preface that I fully recognize the importance of data and analytics as a source of value in the solutions. Scott, I would love kind of your perspective on where you draw the lines or what types of software solutions you expect to provide. So just talking about the increased software intensity, the life insurance software acquisition and some other software acquisitions you've done.But you also continued to partner with the likes of Guidewire and I think there was a relatively recent announcement with Duck Creek. So what types of software solutions do you expect to provide? Where do you look to partner? Do you increasingly compete against some of those vertical software providers over time? Thanks. -- Yeah. No. It's a good question and it does relate to the fabric of our company. So bottom line for me is that I would only want to see us in software businesses that have the potential to yield data assets that we can use and reuse for analytic purposes.That's really sort of the bottom line. So there are core transaction processing platforms that tend to exist in all the verticals that we serve. And to the extent that those particular platforms are unlikely to yield any sort of data rights, then it's just less likely to be of interest to us. That's the first dimension of it.And the second sort of relates to the first, and that is what we're really interested in is what we call platform to analytic environment. So we want to be the place where somebody who's trying to make a decision goes. They go in the morning and they stay there much, if not all, of the day. That's our ambition.That's where we want to be. Almost by definition, if that's the nature of the software you're providing, then you are close to the data sets. So that's really the distinction that I would trace for you here. -- Thank you. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. When I think about a few callout drivers that you discussed in insurance, I'm thinking about the opportunities in life and InsurTech which sounds pretty robust, as well as the U.K.which I think as mentioned -- Lee, I think you mentioned as being pretty strong. Can you over the next few years perhaps quantify or dimensionalize how those may bend the growth curve in your insurance business? -- Sure. So I'm going to -- I'll take a first cut at it and I'm sure Mark can provide some broader perspective on it. So I think as it relates to the InsurTech dimension, our view is that it contributes to incremental growth across two dimensions. One is that we have a group of new clients that we are serving in a traditional context with our industry standard products and other data sets.But the other dimension is that they are bringing innovation, new ways of doing things that is putting more of a focus around our traditional customers to utilize data more intensively than they may have in the past. And that is creating new opportunities for us to develop products to support their needs. And our LightSpeed suite of products is probably a perfect example of that dynamic. And so it is -- I would describe it one level as accelerating the demand and the expansion of analytic objects and demand for platform analytics that has enabled our underwriting and rating business to generate levels of growth, as you've seen in this quarter, that probably wouldn't have been expected two or three years ago.So I think that's one dimension of it. And we've spent a lot of time thinking about the life opportunity and I'll hand it over to Mark to describe how we see that opportunity influencing and providing incremental growth for us. -- So let me basically say it this way. I think there's two types of InsurTechs. One is I'm an insurer or probably a managing general agent of an underwriting business or at least trying to find business. There, what they are looking for is to get into business fast and automate.And that drive toward automation, drive toward technology has been a wonderful opportunity for us. And we have had some great sales there, and it has accelerated growth across all of insurance. There's also InsurTech that they're trying to do some technology around data and information and, although probably on the outskirts, could be competitive over time. So we certainly keep track of them.I guess the theme that I'll bring out which kind of may tie together a couple of questions is, our customers are interested in content. That's king. But at the same time, they're pushing toward automation. They want this seamless ecosystem so that they can tap into any data or any solution, whether it's their own or a third party.And they expect, through a series of APIs and micro services, to be able to consume that information or consume that application in a very seamless way. And I think that is a large part of why we're thinking that the FAST acquisition will help us quite a bit. It is that light touch, quick implementation, low upfront costs that life insurers are looking for. And we see the same thing.Probably P&C is a little bit ahead from an analytics perspective, but we see the same thing for our P&C customers. So hopefully, that provides a little broader color. -- Thanks Mark.Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Your pace of M&A activity has picked up in recent quarters, particularly with the acquisition of Genscape.When you had a similar level of M&A activity in 2018, EBITDA margins did contract by about 100 bps. So diving deeper into margins in the year ahead, can you discuss how the margin profile of Genscape compares to your earlier acquisitions, particularly ones being integrated in 2018, and if you intend to change your pace of investment activity in the breakout opportunities this year ahead versus earlier years? -- Yeah. Thanks George. So whenever we talk about the margin impact, I want to kind of start with the fact that the important thing for all of our businesses is that they have fundamental operating leverage that allows us to deliver on EBITDA growth in excess of revenue growth. Because we think that's the fundamental value creation driver for that business.And so we look at each of those businesses. And every business has a different margin dynamic, but we want to make certain that that dynamic is present, and we have the ability to improve upon that over time. We -- so when we are looking at acquisitions, George, we are fundamentally making a capital decision and a growth decision in terms of, is this going to be a good use of capital, can we generate a good return on the business and what we can do to enhance it? And beneath that, is there operating leverage that will allow us to continue to generate that EBITDA growth over time? And so when we talk about our organic constant currency revenue growth, yes, we are making that adjustment so that we see that dynamic across our business as a whole. We tend not to be overly focused on the portfolio impact of the acquisitions because if it is a good return acquisition and it has operating leverage, then it will allow us to generate that EBITDA growth over time.And I think talking about an individual acquisition like Genscape which is going to come in at a lower margin than the rest of the business, that will naturally have a portfolio impact. But what we can -- we hope to generate with that business and its association with Wood Mackenzie and generating incremental returns and incremental margins should really drive what we're focused on which is that EBITDA expansion ahead of revenue growth. So I know that isn't a complete answer to your question but philosophically, I think it's important to understand that that's the way we think about those acquisitions and their contribution.Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Great. Thanks. Lee, you talked about kind of three different portfolio transactions in the area of financial services and insurance. Can you give us kind of the overall revenue and margin impact from those dispositions? -- So I think I gave the impact from the Vexcel transaction. So -- and the other ones, I think we can deal with in a follow-up call. They're not that material overall to the business. I think the $8 million is really the bulk of it.So we can probably find -- we can fine-tune that with you off-line separately, but it's -- the Geomni-Vexcel transaction that would have a more significant impact. The rest are less significant. -- Super. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Thanks so much. Just wanted to step back and kind of look at your portfolio of assets. You did some pruning, I think, over the past quarter or so. Is there anything else left to divest? And then, also, do you see synergies between your three major verticals? Obviously, within insurance, there's a lot but I'm just wondering cross synergies with the other verticals.Thanks. -- So we're always looking at the mix of assets we've got, but I would say that I think we have done a fair amount of the kind of work that was expressed in those three moves. We'll always keep our eyes open, but there's nothing major which is imminent. To your question about synergies across the verticals, we have repurposed energy data into the insurance vertical. We're looking at opportunities to tie together observations from retail banking with consumer forms of insurance.So that work is always going on in the background. But the thing I would really highlight for you is all of the technical work that Eric described before, this is the kind of work where it would be more burdensome for any one of our verticals or even a business unit inside of a vertical to take it on, on their own because these are pretty large expenditures. And if you're going to do it right, you have to really commit to these things. Eric talked about the work you have to do to transition to the cloud or to create the data fabric inside of the platform data environment that we provide to all parts of Verisk.And not only does doing this work excellently in the center provide acceleration to each of the businesses inside of each of the verticals, but it really represents a very cost-efficient way of doing it as well. And so that is -- that's actually, to me, one of the large major points of logic as to why we should be in multiple verticals. And another one is all of what we do in these verticals, and not every vertical has this quality, but all the verticals that we're in, the opportunity for unique differentiated data assets exists. And that's not true in a lot of verticals but it is true in the places where we do business. -- I would add as a case in point, we often get questions about the relevance in -- of the financial services business. And as we've talked about, they deal with a data set that is, in order of magnitude, if not more, larger than many of our other businesses. But the expertise that we have developed in cloud technology and data analytics within that business generates a return on intellectual capital that we have leveraged in our lens platform, within the insurance business as we're implementing that cloud technology. And probably wouldn't be as effective in bringing those efficiencies and advantages if we hadn't been dealing with that data center, with that level of expertise.And so I think it's a great kind of case in point of how we leverage that. -- Yeah. I'll just -- I don't want to answer too many times. But case in point is inside the London insurance market, the expertise and technology associated with the Verisk financial services assets were combined with kind of ISO expertise to build a platform there that has been kind of changing some of the London market transaction processing. So been very effective. -- Next question.Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking question. So a quick question on claims. Even excluding injunction, it was a bit soft because of the fewer other events.I was just wondering if you can provide any color on how much of the revenue is generated from these other events. And as we think about going forward, should we see this business reaccelerate given the stability of the subscription business? Thanks. -- So this is Mark. Thanks for the question. So first of all, I want to start with the insurance business as a whole was very strong. We think of it as a portfolio, and we're very pleased with the interaction with customers and where we've progressed.Specifically to claims, I think there's three things that we've seen over the course of a little longer term and, clearly, short term. One, I think we've talked about some of the extensions we've had really on the claims fraud or claims fraud detection side of the world related to outside of P&C health companies and the like, where we've brought some kind of -- some big customers in, and that's kind of rolled off. But more specifically, as it relates to the fourth quarter, clearly, the injunction affected us. We weren't able to deliver the growth that we've been delivering inside of Geomni.That was a negative. And the other thing that was clearly changed or different in the fourth quarter of '19 relative to '18 was a relatively modest set of storms. There was a very quiet storm season. This isn't about catastrophes.This is just severe weather throughout the nation that had quite a bit of impact on what I'll refer to as the claims business. So those two things were kind of the anomalies in the quarter. I will reinforce the underlying business, the underlying economics remain very strong. Customer engagement, very strong.And I think the mission we're on with regard to automation and automating claim adjusting is kind of the theme inside the industry. So we remain optimistic. -- And Mark, let's just clarify real quick. When you talk about the effect of the health insurers coming into our ClaimSearch platform that you referred to as rolling off, what you meant was it provided -- it's not that they went away. -- They certainly didn't. -- They're still in the process as much as they ever were. -- The grow-over. -- Right. -- Kicked in. -- It represented growth in 2018 and into 2019. But now they're in and they're here.Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. You may ask your question. -- Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. The large insurance brokers seem to be pushing data analytics as a growth area for their business. Can you tell us how you're working with them or should we view their strategies as potentially encroaching on your business? They've also reported good organic revenue growth and it's in part due to the strong pricing environment in commercial lines.Can you talk to us about how your business is affected by pricing trends in commercial lines insurance? And then finally, on LightSpeed, can you give us an idea of the size of that business? I've been struggling to identify actual customers in our channel checks, but that doesn't mean I'm looking in the right place. So any help there would be appreciated. -- Well, you managed to get three questions in there at least. -- I don't know. I think I counted four. -- I'll just take -- Mark, why don't you and I do this together. I'll just take the first part of that which is the question about the brokers. So the brokers -- and we really do not have a lot of overlap. The brokers from time to time attempt put together some forms of data analytics in order to try to add value inside of their customer relationships.But fundamentally, we -- they're much more of a service-oriented kind of a business. We license subscription solutions to our customers. And the brokers touch a good number of situations. And they have the data associated with the transactions that they're engaged in, but those data sets are really not overlapping of the data sets that we have got.And so, I mean, it's a practical matter out in the marketplace. We just don't compete with the brokers, and nor do I think we will compete with the brokers. They're just a fundamentally separate kind of an environment. And in fact, they operate as customers because, particularly, our catastrophe modeling solutions are made available to them as well as to others.So yes, if I was running one of the major brokerages -- actually, if I was running almost any business in the world, I would try to make it more data analytic as a way of trying to achieve advantage. And that's what they're working on. But I don't. Their business model and ours is very different, basically, and I think will remain.So Mark, you want to take on those other points? -- Yeah. And I'll just add to yours. I think from a brokering theme perspective, clearly they're looking to differentiate themselves that they are providing analytics. I think most of that analytics, at least the way we've seen it, is sold into and provided to the corporate customer, where we're more on the insurer side of that.I think your second question was around pricing and pricing impact. So commercial line's a hardening market, if you will. I think the short answer is that if our customers are growing quicker, there's more opportunity to focus on top line, focus on dancing and potentially purchasing new solutions to foster that growth. So I think it's a friendly environment when everyone's growing, and it's probably more opportunities to buy new solutions or extend them.We do have this wonderful solution inside of underwriting and rating our ISO business. When it is a difficult period or it's a soft market, people have to go back to the actuarial fundamentals. They have to go to fundamentals around how I underwrite because they want to be profitable. So clearly, that supports our business as well, but I think everyone is in a better shape with a high tide floating all boats.Last question I think was around LightSpeed. Let me say it this way. The way we've packaged LightSpeed is we are trying to take -- and in the world of insurance, I'll use personal automobile, you can get online, and you can get a quote pretty quickly. But what typically happens is, after you get that quote, people then run all the different reports to get information about you, whether you're in an accident, whether you're impacting history, less accidents.And all of that motor vehicle record data, all that costs money. So they then run that information, and they more or less change the price in about 35% of the cases. That's a customer-unfriendly way to go. So we are pushing this data-forward strategy.We are trying to move to point of sale, so there's no separation between buying a quote that is more attractive for the consumer. And we are very uniquely positioned in the commercial lines market because of the data and information we have, more so than even in personal lines. And that strategy, that approach has been meeting quite a bit of receptivity among major customers, both large ones and those InsurTechs we're talking about. So when we talk about LightSpeed, it's a package of solutions and products.And many, many insurers are buying pieces, and a few very large ones have signed up for what I'll call the full package. So that has definitely been contributing to growth inside of our underwriting and rating business. -- When customers use it Mark, I just -- I would think a lot of them actually identify with Verisk rather than saying oh that's Touchstone because it's a whole series of services. We tie them together as Touchstone, but I think the customers are relating to the overall brand, Verisk. -- Thank you for your answers. -- You're welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. -- So good morning. And the question I had was to see if we could get an update on the new product pipeline, specifically around loan verifier, also some of the life insurance underwriting products, and then maybe also if you could comment on how you plan on leveraging some of the unstructured data sets, audio and images that Eric mentioned in his comments. -- Why don't you take those on Mark? -- Sure. So let me kind of walk through those. I think you were talking about loan verifier. You were talking about life insurance and some unstructured data.So let me start with the final two because in some ways, they're connected. So life insurance, we think, provides a pretty big opportunity for us. We do have some solutions already available. So think about our catastrophe modeling, what we refer to as extreme event modeling.We do work around longevity models, mortality shock model. Think of pandemic, coronavirus, we do that type of work, and that fits into some of the life insurance models that are necessary and interesting. What we're also doing is we're doing work around models that it relates to specific underwriting decisions. So that is around partnerships with the medical inspection bureau which represents a group inside of life around, I'll call it, physicals and health.We've done some work around electronic healthcare records and doing some analytics there. The two analytics that you're most focused on, we have done some work around tobacco. We've done some work around avocation. If you're kind of like skydiving, that doesn't make you the best risk.And kind of combining some of the technology that Eric and his team were talking about with some of the specialists we have from an insurance perspective, we have used some voice recognition technology which allows us to understand things about your voice and whether there's indication that may lead to tobacco use as an example. So hopefully, you can kind of understand one small example of how it fits into a wonderful technology group helping an insurance business extend into insurance. And FAST provides some of that. Hopefully that responds... -- Maybe talk a little bit also Mark about using imagery to interpret damage to vehicles. -- Absolutely. -- Without having to send a human being. -- So I think one of the things that we would love to do as a part of automated adjusting is do a quick look. So this is a what I'll refer to as low severity type of crash, small dollars, but highly frequent. You can do a quick review and make payments. So we have some abilities to take a look at images.Just think about machine learning and understanding a couple of things. One, is the image legitimate and accurate based upon time and date and stamp and things like that? Was it manipulated? But we go beyond that to do a few more things. One, we're saying, is it salvageable or not? Should it be a complete loss? And then two, if it's salvageable, we can do a quick estimate as to what's going to cost to repair it. And those are the type of things that advanced analytics provide to automate this process.And it's a quick way to do things that have typically taken quite a bit of time and effort to in the past. Great. Bill, I think you also talked about loan verifier. Loan verifier is another important idea for us.What it does though with any of our really differentiated ideas, it does take us time to aggregate data. So what we are working with is working with insurers to get information and access to a lot of that information behind the scenes, so that we can connect those folks who are on the loan side of things, think of the banks, with those insurers, who are kind of ensuring that risk, and piece those together. Some of that information we have in-house. At the same time, we have a very strong standard stewardship approach to things, and we can only use data for use cases that have been provided to us.So we're working with insurers to validate the use case and honestly bring on customers. So hopefully maybe a little long-winded but a full answer to your questions. -- Well thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. You may ask your question. -- Hi. Good morning. Realizing your acquisitions of Genscape and FAST are still pretty fresh. I was hoping you could provide an update on how those integrations are trending.And then any commentary on the early pipeline build for those products? Thanks. -- Integrations are right on track with both of them. We actually just reviewed that a week ago. And with respect to everything from cost factors to sales, they are performing almost exactly the way that we expected them to. And in both cases, they nest very nicely inside of existing organizations.So these transitions have been very organic and the pipelines are good. The pipelines are strong. -- And the only thing I would add is I think that there is a genuine enthusiasm, in the case of Genscape among the Wood Mackenzie team, for the ability to utilize that data and integrate it in their analysis and the products that they're serving for their clients. So every time I'm in contact with Wood Mackenzie, I hear their enthusiasm for utilizing that data. FAST is more recent, but I can tell you, I think the -- on the insurance side, particularly on the life side, our ability to work with them as we described before, a high level of excitement about what we can potentially accomplish together. -- Final question.Your final question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question. -- Yes. So maybe I should ask like an 18-part question. I'm just -- I'll give you a softball to end the day. On the insurance and energy side, maybe you could talk about the differences in the demand backdrop heading into 2020 versus 2019, either from a pipeline or a necessity on your customer part perspective.Thanks. -- Yeah. So let me just give you the perspective that really explains Verisk Analytics. We have -- and this has been true for a long period of time, our company has grown faster than the end markets that we serve. And the reason is that our customers are rotating their own budgets in the direction of what it is that we do.They want to become more automated, and they want to become more deeply analytic in the way that they run their businesses. So you will see a lot of discussion about the level of technology spending on the part of the companies that populate the verticals that we serve. And that in and of itself is a very constructive trend, but you have to actually take that pool of spending and break that down further into sort of data center keep-the-lights-on sort of spending versus the platform's analytic environments, analytic objects that we provide. And even within the technology category, there has been a rotation in the direction of what we do.So if you're looking for explanation in terms of where our business is and where it's going to go, that is the driving force of what our companies are trying to do. And the fact that because of our vertical approach, we understand their issues. We have deeply intimate relationships because we sell -- in the case of insurance, we may be selling up to 20 families of solutions to our customers. And from all this depth of relationship and all of the data that they make available to us, it is really the perfect place from which to try to think about the next thing that they need and work collaboratively with them to develop it.And that's why our business grows. The actual macro environments inside of insurance and energy, I mean, they sort of wax and wane a little bit. But I don't -- those will not in my view have explanatory power in terms of the growth of our business in 2020, 2021 and on.There are no further questions at this time. Presenters you may continue. -- Yes. Great. Well thanks everybody for joining us. And as Lee mentioned, we'll have a number of follow-ups with you and look forward to those.Thanks for your interest. We'll speak with you soon.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

"Investors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 17th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new April 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $155.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $152.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $160.41/share today.

Because the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 74%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.87% return on the cash commitment, or 13.67% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $155.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $165.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.35.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $160.41/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $165.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.33% if the stock gets called away at the April 17th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $165.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $165.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.70% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $160.41) to be 15%.

"e all know the FAANGs trade — and that all of them happen to be part of the Nasdaq-100Index (NDX).But while Facebook (), Amazon (), Apple (), Netflix () and Google () represent substantial market cap, they are just five components of the widely known Nasdaq-100. There are 95 other companies that contribute to making the NDX one of the best-performing indexes.To help investors better understand why the NDX is known for being home to some of the most innovative companies in the world, we’re highlighting six lesser known constituents we think you should get to know:While many Americans haven't heard of Baidu (), millions of people in China certainly know the name. The “Google” of China, Baidu is the most well-known and used search engine on the mainland, capturing between 70-80% of the search market share in China — which is a population of more than 850 million online users.The dominant search engine by far, Baidu was even number one when Google still operated in China. After shuttering its service, Baidu took on a similar mantle in the Chinese market and economy, bolstering its search advertising business as it added services like mobile search, online wallets, maps, music, encyclopedias, news, social media and online community tools.Started in 2000 by Robin Li, its current CEO, Baidu was founded on two principles: simplicity and reliability. Also, its name is an allusion to a Song dynasty poem written more than 800 years ago, the literal meaning of the word being ""hundreds of times,"" a representation of a continuous striving toward the ideal. Such cultural cornerstones help explain how it climbed to its marketing-leading position.Perhaps not a household name, NVIDIA () is a near-legendary brand in video gaming and various tech sectors. As a leading producer of graphics units, NVIDIA has revolutionized digital technologies in several ways, with business in artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, robotics, entertainment, and much more. In fact, in 2019 it was ranked as the No. 1 most innovative company in AI by Fast Company.NVIDIA is basically responsible for the life-like graphics you see in video games and other computing applications, having invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999, a technology it continues to reinvent today with real-time graphics.Apart from its achievements in business, NVIDIA has also received recognition for its support of environmental, social and governance goals. Barron's annually ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded companies on ESG factors, and NVIDIA made the top 100 in 2019.Modeling software has been a boon for architects, engineers, product designers, construction firms, public planners, animators and other professionals. And they can thank Autodesk (), a pioneer in computer-aided design (CAD), for the tools that help them create the things they envision.With tens of products across various industries, Autodesk has helped continually innovate new solutions for designing needs. It was recognized for this pedigree of pushing the envelope when it was ranked No. 15 by  on its list of the most innovative companies in the world. Today, besides solutions for construction, civil engineering and entertainment, Autodesk is also working in the Internet of Things, 3D printing and other emerging technologies.Autodesk has had to contend with upheaval in the software market — shifting from licensing-based sales of boxed solutions to recurring revenue through cloud computing subscriptions — but has come out in pole position.Data is the lifeblood of business today, and Verisk Analytics () lives in the numbers, helping deliver insights that drive corporate decision-making. An analytics company that focuses on the insurance, financial, and energy and specialty markets, Verisk leverages its unique data sets and extensive domain expertise to provide risk assessment, intelligent compliance and predictive analytics, among other products and services.Verisk's data assets are deep, allowing it to mine billions of insurance policy transactions and trillions in consumer spending for insights. Hundreds of subject matter experts in fields like commodity analytics and GIS mapping contribute to the vast experience of the company, as does CEOForbes in 2019.While technology has led to many social and economic gains, the new digital world is also one rife with cybercrime. With threats lurking around every online corner, organizations need rock-solid defenses to protect their data and reputations. Enter Check Point Software Technologies (), a leading provider of diverse cybersecurity products.Check Point has garnered international recognition in its nearly 30 years of operation, having grown, matured and innovated alongside the wider world of tech. Check Point has collected awards and recognition for its performance in cybersecurity from the likes of Gartner, Forrester, IDC and various other publications. Most recently, it won the Security Innovation of the Year category in the 2018-2019 Cloud Awards for its CloudGuard Dome9 platform.Founded in Israel with U.S. headquarters in Silicon Valley, the company's sights are trained on combating the fifth generation of cyberattacks.These days, surgeons need a steady hand not only when using a scalpel themselves but also when operating robotic surgical equipment. Such technology has become commonplace in the operating room, if not entirely essential to the success of some advanced procedures. In those terms, Intuitive Surgical () is helping to revolutionize health care while also improving patient outcomes and safety.Founded in 1995, Intuitive builds the da Vinci system, which since its launch in 1999 has defined and advanced intelligent surgery, helping develop minimally invasive procedures. In 24 years of operation, more than six million minimally invasive surgeries have been completed and nearly 5,000 da Vinci systems installed worldwide.Intuitive, like Verisk, is also well-equipped at the helm to navigate the monumental shifts and opportunities in health care: Its CEO, Gary Guthart, was ranked as the No. 14 most innovative leader in America in 2019 in the same Forbes list.Combined, these innovative companies along with the FAANGs, represent just over 1/10th of the Nasdaq-100. Yet this small sample size makes it undeniably clear the level of innovation, performance and impact that each NDX component can boast. about the Nasdaq-100 and how to trade these companies and the index.Nasdaq® is a registered trademark of Nasdaq, Inc.

There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $132.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $176.00.  The standard deviation is $11.707.


But the whole reason to look at the average VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $161.17/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $161.17 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

erisk Analytics (NASDAQ: VRSK), a data analytics and risk assessment company, has seen its stock price fall by about 10% over the last month following its mixed Q3 earnings report.

"egendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Thursday, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.0, after changing hands as low as $144.32 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 57.9.  A bullish investor could look at VRSK's 28.0 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of VRSK shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, VRSK's low point in its 52 week range is $102.74 per share, with $164.97 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $144.70.

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q3 2019 , Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk third-quarter 2019 earnings results conference call. My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator for today. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk's head of investor relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar, for opening remarks and introduction.Ms. Brodbar, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, Jay, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third-quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, chairman, president, and chief executive officer, who will provide a brief overview of the strategic direction of our business. Mark Anquillare, chief operating officer, will then provide an update on our insurance segment.Lastly, Lee Shavel, chief financial officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Verisk Analytics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.  -- Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk had another strong quarter of growth, fueled by our market-leading innovation and continued focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience. Verisk reported organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.7%.This growth was driven by strength in our insurance segment and solid improvements in energy and specialized markets. On the innovation front, I'm especially pleased to see strong revenue growth tied to the investments we have made in platformed analytic environments. Such environments include our visualized ClaimSearch for fraud fighting and claims adjudication, our Touchstone platform for catastrophe modeling, X1 for global property estimating, Lens for energy analytics, and our PowerAdvocate platform for adjusting and understanding supply chain costs in the energy space. These platforms take the level of intimacy with our customers and their workflows to a whole new level and deliver enhanced growth and operating leverage.Specifically at Wood Mackenzie, this month, we released the second module to Lens called Global Upstream Valuations, which expands screening and valuation capabilities across the whole world. This solution enables our customers to analyze and interact with our comprehensive global upstream data set to make faster, data-driven commercial decisions. We continue to be encouraged by the early results of Lens, but equally important is the fact that having a new and unique product in the marketplace has really energized our sales teams. This has translated into improving sales of our core research as well as strong growth in our breakout solutions, including subsurface, chemicals and the energy transition practice.Our energy transition practice was previously known as power in renewables, and this shift reflects our commitment to helping our clients cope with changes in the energy markets. In our PowerAdvocate business, we are experiencing strong growth as we are helping our energy customers use data to more effectively spend their capital and save costs. We see opportunities to leverage the C-suite relationships from Wood Mackenzie to introduce PowerAdvocate at an enterprisewide level and also to help bring our spend and cost solution. One of my leading indicators of the health of our business is how we are doing with the new disruptive players in our verticals as well as the largest and most established players.We are doing well on both fronts. We continue to win new business with InsurTechs as they find value in our full suite of solutions, and we continue to see progress in the cross-selling of even more valuable solutions to the established leaders in all three of our verticals. I spent several weeks in Asia recently, visiting with client leaders across our verticals, from Saudi Arabia to India to Japan. What struck me was how alert the CEOs of the leading companies around the globe are to data analytic innovation and their extreme interest in Verisk solutions.We see this driving an increasing level of inquiry in a growing pipeline of opportunities for our products. I'm also pleased with the progress we have made with respect to our infrastructure and analytic methods over the past 90 days. We continue to make steady progress in moving our computing infrastructure to the cloud. In the past, you've heard me talk about how cloud capacity grows in a linear fashion, whereas on-premise computing gets retired episodically at what I call shells.Because of the great work of our team, we have now reached the first of those shells and are seeing the expected efficiencies. We will continue to pursue these infrastructure improvements and savings persistently, business by business, product by product, over the next few years. The global expansion of our data science team is coming along nicely, and we are delighted with the quality and capacity of our emerging data science team in Krakow. We are now out in the market with industry-standard insurance solutions that incorporate machine-learned methodologies, which take the world of regulatory-ready methods to a whole new level.On the strategic acquisition front, our focus continues to be on adding valuable data sets within our existing verticals that can be leveraged across our enterprise to drive high returns on capital. Genscape and BuildFax represent opportunities to both extend their businesses and enhance our existing products and relationships. Genscape is a market leader in sensed data for the power, oil and gas and maritime end markets. Genscape uses a network of sensors to gather proprietary data that is real- or near-real-time.We believe we can create value by combining Genscape's real-time short-term data set with WoodMac's longer-term asset valuation data sets. We plan to develop new analytics solutions based on these combined data sets and ultimately get the data set incorporated into the Lens platform so that it can be seamlessly integrated into customers' workflows. We also see opportunities to cross-sell and expand into new client segments as there is limited customer overlap. Ultimately, we believe that Genscape, as a part of WoodMac, will bolster our journey as the energy mix shifts toward more of a balance between molecule-based and electron-based.BuildFax is a leading provider of proprietary condition and history data with a blue-chip customer base that is now part of our ISO underwriting business. We are excited to incorporate BuildFax's data to enhance our existing property data and analytics solutions and see opportunities to develop new solutions as we partner with our insurance customers to help them drive in their underwriting process to become quicker and more precise. And we also see real opportunity to expand distribution and cross-sell BuildFax's core products across our customer base. Finally, I'd like to take a minute to clarify developments in the imaging space.In connection with the jury verdict and associated injunction related to the Geomni roof report business, we have recorded a $125 million legal reserve. We were disappointed in the verdict and plan to appeal once we receive final judgment. With respect to the current operations, the ruling pertains to only some of what we do in our Geomni unit, and our roof report business represents about 1% of our annual revenues. We are energetically working to develop a non-infringing alternative method to the current technology.We are also working toward adjusting the cost structure over the next few quarters in light of the injunction. To that end, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the negative impact on profitability and cash flow of the roughly $7 million in lost quarterly revenue and should see sequential progress over the next several quarters. Perhaps the most important thing to note about our imagery business is the asset we have built in our image library and our image capture program. We now have a distinctive data asset on a national scale.We continue to believe strongly that the combination of automated measurement through remote imagery and automated estimation can create great value for our insurance customers, for Verisk and for our shareholders, and remain committed to and as excited about these technologies as ever. Having gone through a number of specifics, let me give you my overall assessment of where we stand. Our verticals are in great shape with the notable achievement of energy and specialized markets exceeding insurance's organic growth rate for the first time, thus expanding our sticky recurrent subscription revenues. Our technical infrastructure is becoming more efficient in real-time, and the technical talent our team has grown through tapping new talent sources.We've supplemented data sets with two acquisitions that we can leverage across our enterprise. While we have lost the contribution to revenue growth provided by 1% of our revenue, we exit the quarter stronger than we entered it. And now I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some insights on our insurance segment. -- Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in insurance, with all businesses contributing to growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.7% was fueled by market-leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement. Our retention rates remain very high as we continue to focus on getting close to our customers and delivering a best-in-class customer service experience.During the quarter, underwriting and rating delivered strong organic constant currency revenue growth across both personal and commercial lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry-standard insurance programs. We continue to see great success in market share gains in personal lines due to the strong sales of our LightSpeed Auto suite of products. We're excited about the new sales and growing pipeline for our data-forward LightSpeed platform extended into small commercial and personal property. In the industry standard insurance programs, we're experiencing growth in customer accounts.We've had success winning engagements with new start-ups and InsurTechs. In extreme event modeling, we're experiencing solid demand for our detailed models driven by signings with new clients as well as expanding relationships with existing ones. We're also seeing increased interest in some of our newer solutions, including our global resilience practice, which works with governments and NGOs. During the quarter, we hosted several successful seminars for our catastrophe modeling business in Auckland, Sydney, London and Zurich that touched more than 350 clients and prospects.And in October, we hosted Verisk Velocity, our signature event for underwriting and rating. The event focused on the future of the insurance industry with an eye toward digitization and automation of the insurance process. The conference attendance increased 46% versus last year as we attracted attendees from 130 insurance companies from around the world. Feedback was positive from participants excited about the direction of our new solutions and our thought leadership in the property and casualty insurance industry.The agenda featured presentations and panel discussions by industry-thought leaders and allowed Verisk to showcase our latest pipeline InsurTech solution. In fact, our customers are telling us that they look to Verisk to drive forward the innovation agenda because we not only develop leading solutions, but we can back them up with financial strength and a long and stable operating history. The claims business also delivered solid growth with contributions from analytics, repair cost estimating, remote imagery and our international businesses. As Scott mentioned, we're seeing nice success with our visualized ClaimSearch platform, which is delivering significant growth in usage and positive sentiment from customers.The platform offers customers improvements like real-time analytics, improved security and privacy protection, fast delivery and is seamlessly integrated into workflows and claim systems. On the international side, we're seeing solid growth from recent acquisitions like Validus in claims subrogation solution, and ENI in claims automation and fraud detection solution. They're now part of our organic [Audio gap] A steady stream of first-to-market innovations is one of the four distinctive [Inaudible] and also a key driver of our growth. In the quarter, we announced several exciting new initiatives, including the launch of our Sequel product suite in the U.S.The early feedback from the market is positive, and the pipeline of interest from among our specialty commercial customers is robust. We also announced solutions and new partnerships within the life insurance market. These solutions utilize the most advanced data analytic methods, including advanced voice analytics, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and will enable Verisk to develop new benchmarking, risk-scoring solutions that can help life insurers on direct policies and manage portfolio risk with increased speed and precision. With that, let me now turn it over to Lee to cover the financial results. -- Thanks, Mark. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background, data trends, and analysis to support our conversation today. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 9% to $653 million.In the current quarter, we incurred some significant nonoperating expenses including, firstly, the $125 million litigation reserve related to our remote imagery business; secondly, $29 million in acquisition-related earn-out expenses, as many of our acquisitions are on target to achieve payments for exceptional performance; and thirdly, a $6 million loss generated from the sale of the retail analytics solutions business, which was previously part of our financial services segment. In light of these expenses, net income and diluted GAAP EPS decreased approximately 80% to $33 million and $0.20 per share, respectively. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for nonoperating items, including currency fluctuations; acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons; acquisition-related costs, including earn-outs, dispositions and nonrecurring items, including the litigation reserve, we believe our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 7.6% in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth across all three segments and delivering on our long-term target of 7% growth.Of our three segments, energy and specialized markets recorded the fastest growth, while insurance also delivered solid results. This was offset in part by softer growth within financial services. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.7%, demonstrating organic constant currency margin expansion, also continuing to invest in future growth opportunities within our business. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 47.4%, flat with the prior year period.This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions decreased total adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 30 basis points in the period. On an organic basis, and particularly on the pre-investment organic basis that we've discussed before, we saw a margin expansion, demonstrating the exceptional operating leverage at the core of our businesses. On this note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis.As you see in the press release, insurance reported 7.7% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 7.9%. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was very broad across our solution sets in personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, LightSpeed Auto suite of products, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. We also had positive contributions from our international business.Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in claims analytics, repair cost estimating solutions, remote imagery solutions, and in international markets. Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 25 basis points to 53.1% from 53.3% in the prior year period, reflecting leverage in our core business more than offset by investment in future growth opportunities and acquisitions. Our fastest-growing segment was energy and specialized markets, which delivered revenue growth of 8.7% for the quarter, representing record growth for that segment. Strong growth in market and cost intelligence solutions as well as noted improvement in our core research and consulting revenues drove the growth.Despite volatility in the oil price and recent geopolitical events in the quarter, we continue to see a stable macro environment and are capitalizing on that with new and innovative platforms that help our customers more efficiently drive revenue growth and deliver cost savings. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.9%, reflecting leverage on solid sales balanced with ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and energy transition practice. Total adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 33.3% from 31.7%. Financial services revenue increased 2.7% in the quarter, led by solid growth in enterprise data management and fraud and credit risk management solutions.This was offset in part by decreases in portfolio management from nonrecurring consulting revenues as well as some pushouts of certain projects. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.5% and total adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 32.8% from 35.5%. We have discussed previously the journey we are on to transition this business from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth. Change at scale is never linear, and as we work through this process, we will continue to see quarterly fluctuations on revenue and growth which are higher than in our other business segments.That said, we are confident in the long-term potential of financial services as we set the business up on a stronger foundation. In the third quarter of 2019, the company completed an additional $200 million issuance of our four and one eighth percentage senior notes due 2029 at an issuance price of 110.9% for an effective yield of 2.78%. The company also entered into a fourth amendment to our revolving credit facility, which reduced the borrowing capacity to $1 billion from $1.5 billion, extended the maturity date to August 15, 2024, and amended the pricing grid with lower rates and improved economics. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter, down 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to the net repayments of our revolving credit facility.Total reported debt was $2.7 billion at September 30, unchanged from the year-end of 2018. Our leverage at the end of the quarter -- of the third quarter 2019 was 2.4 times. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $312 million at September 30, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter compared to 13.9% in the prior year quarter primarily due to the impact of a lower level of option exercises and nondeductible earn-out expenses in the current period.We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $186 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.12 for the third quarter, up 2.6% and 3.7%, respectively. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a decrease in interest expense and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate.Net cash provided by operating activities was $214 million for the quarter, down 5.7% from prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $780 million year to date, up 2.5% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter, up 10.1% from the prior year, and capex represented 9.3% of total revenue in the quarter. We now expect capital expenditures to come in at the low end of the $220 million to $240 million range we provided for 2019.Free cash flow of $153 million for the quarter, a decrease of 10.8% from the prior year due to higher income tax payments associated with a lower level of option exercises and timing differences related to the payment of certain expenses. Free cash flow was $627 million year to date, and an increase of 3.4% from the prior year. During the third quarter, we returned $116 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 491,000 shares at a weighted average price of $152.84 for a total cost of $75 million.At September 30th, we had $228 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the fourth quarter. And on September 30th, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. And on October 23rd of this year, our board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on December 31, 2019, for shareholders of record on December 13, 2019.We are excited about our opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line fore questions.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Your line is open. -- My first question is just broadly around innovation and, I guess, the existing contribution from those products. You mentioned a lot on the call today. And I think recently, you launched the cyber data exchange, court side, etc., etc. Is there any way to parse out like how much of the last several years innovation is contributing to the revenue growth today? -- It's kind of hard to separate the effects, Manav. And reason is that some of the innovation shows us as an entirely unique product with a very discrete revenue stream, but it also shows up as increased penetration of an existing product or price realization related to an existing product. So it actually shows up in several places. And an example of that would be the Lens platform, which is supportive of the whole suite of WoodMac solutions, but also represents a discrete revenue stream in and of itself.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan. Your line is open. -- Scott, you discussed the impact of the litigation with regard to Geomni. Could you just give us a sense of if you feel the future opportunity is reduced? I know you mentioned you're trying to find non-infringing ways to address our roofing opportunity. But are you shifting some focus to the non-roofing opportunities or just, I guess, how should we think about the future here? -- So we've always been interested in remote imagery for a whole variety of reasons, and actually, those reasons relate to use cases which are even beyond the insurance vertical, and we're energetically pursuing those as well. So first of all, by way of context, what we do is a lot more than just roof reporting, and we remain very interested in the category. We think that imaging remotely and then being able to, in a very automated way, translate what you've seen with the sensor is just -- that's an important technology for the world going forward, and we're intending to participate in it. We have participated in it, and there are a number of ways to monetize the imagery itself.And so no, I don't think that our opportunity is -- we don't see it any differently than we did. -- Thank you. -- Welcome. Thanks.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra. Your line is open. -- Thanks for the question. Can you just help size the annualized revenues for the two acquisitions, Genscape and BuildFax? And then also just talk about the historic growth and margin profile for these two acquisition specs? -- Yes. Ashish, thanks for the question. We haven't broken out the revenues for those acquisitions separately. It will become organic.We're still closing Genscape and expect that within the next couple of weeks. But I would expect for the organic components incorporated in the fourth-quarter results where you begin to get some sense of the scale of that. -- That's helpful. Thanks.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas. Your line is open.Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to stick with the Genscape acquisition. I was -- I know you guys gave some good color in your remarks, and I appreciate that.But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the product set, how it's complementary to your existing business, potentially with an example. And then any synergies we can think about in pairing that with the Verisk business as it stands today? Thanks. -- Sure. So first of all, just -- I want to make sure everybody understands the breadth of what we do in the energy space. So we work with oil and gas companies on a global basis. We work with those who are producing the alternatives in terms of the renewables, and we also work with electric utilities.So I wanted to sell that -- to say that the way that the Genscape business got built was by creating sensors, which actually talk about real-time flows in those ecosystems. So for example, there are sensors that are literally measuring the amount of current running through the transmission line. There are sensors which are literally metering the flow of liquefied natural gas, for example. And these real-time data sets, we think, are very complementary to the data sets we've already got.So in what we do with Wood Mackenzie, we have really good granular operating data, for example, from the wellhead but it's not as real-time as these other data sets that we're talking about. So now pull those two data sets together and provide even more of a perspective about what's happening, commodity by commodity, location by location. And we just know that, that's going to be valuable for our customers.Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee. Your line is open. -- Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So, Scott, you've been talking for a while now, probably a couple of years about just the work you're doing with your technology infrastructure moving more appropriate to the cloud.You've also alluded to some efficiencies there and, obviously, a lot of discussion of innovation. So can you just take a step back for us and talk about how you see the cloud and where you are in the process, number one; number two, what you see the long-term opportunity? As I'm sure you're aware, a number of your information services -- competitors have actually proven out meaningful cost saves but also have seen the ability to accelerate their innovation efforts by getting more of their data into the cloud and hooking customers into that. So are you on that same path? Do you see those same opportunities and where exactly are you today? -- Yes. So we -- yes, I mean, so you really had there, Gary, the two categories of benefit that arise from rotating our infrastructure into the cloud. So one of them has to do with agility, and that has to do with we can compute anywhere around the world, literally, by going to our, say, AWS dashboard and turning on new servers. It's that easy and it's that fast.So the ability to spin up new products. I would also say that our customers are increasingly interested in being able to interact with what we provide in a whole variety of ways. To the extent that what they're interested in, is the sort of API on demand kind of approach, then being already platforms in the cloud just makes it even that easier for them to attach to it. So you've got all those benefits and then you've got cost benefits.And so we're very much in pursuit of both of those. And with respect to where we are in the journey, so you're right. We've been talking about it for a couple of years. It's a lot of heavy lifting, and it does play out over time.So what I said in my remarks earlier is we've reached the first shelf. So we've seen the first return of efficiency on the investments we've been making in moving to the cloud. There will be several more shells over the course of the next couple of years. And so we feel very good about where we are.I'll just say that we have a very close relationship with one of the cloud providers. We've just found it logical and convenient to sort of dig in, especially with one of them. And they give us a lot of feedback that says that we're actually in advanced implementation of cloud computing at the scale that we're doing it. So we -- there's a -- we still have a good distance to go.Actually, I look forward to the next shelves. But in the meantime, I'm very pleased with the work that our team is doing. -- And, Gary, this is Lee. Just to supplement that a bit. And one thing that I want to make certain that everyone understands is that this is a discipline in a process. It's not a monolithic project where you do everything at once.You literally have hundreds of individual products that need to be the data sets, the applications need to be moved to the cloud, the code needs to be optimized for the cloud. And so it is an ongoing process. And what I can assure you is that the economics are very good, both from an opex standpoint and from a capex standpoint. We are taking this with some kind of key projects that we've demonstrated what we can accomplish, and that's guiding us in the future projects ahead.So we think this will be a very clear uplift for us from a capital efficiency and from a margin perspective that will factor into our ability to further enhance our operating leverage across the business. But I want to make sure that everyone has an appreciation. This is something that you literally have to go product by product in order to make sure that you're fully realizing the potential.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler. Your line is open. -- Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask about energy and specialized markets and just make sure I'm not missing anything, but it feels like the phrase solid improvement is underselling how good the numbers look to me. And when you describe it, I hear a lot of positive factors that sound recurring with, I guess, PowerAdvocate, cross-selling, the improvement in research and consulting and the Lens benefits. So is there any significant onetime revenue from consulting? Or I don't know if there's PowerAdvocate success fees or anything like that in the quarter or -- just curious on kind of the way you're characterizing the performance of that business.Thanks. -- Yes. Thank you, Jeff. We're obviously pleased with the results. I think I would try to break it down a bit by saying we saw solid improvement in those WoodMac -- in both the subscription and the consulting revenues at WoodMac, so there was progress there.And PowerAdvocate is clearly contributing, and I would say, had -- is having an exceptional 2019 as a result from some very good pipeline build at the end of 2018 and into 2019. And so part of driving through, we are seeing that reflected both in some of the implementation revenue as well as the subscription revenue, but over time, we will expect to see a higher percentage of that kind of core subscription and recurring revenue within it. Again, it's still primarily recurring revenue, but we are at the front end of some of their success early in the year in bringing new clients onto their solutions platform.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. I wonder, Mark, or Lee, if you could just remind us about sort of fthe macro exposure and insurance.And I'm thinking about two factors: one, generally a hardening P&C market to the extent we go into that kind of environment, how that might affect the insurance business; and then two, if you could just give us an update on cat modeling. We heard one of your competitors perhaps if the reinsurance market continues to soften, doesn't seem apparent in your results, but I'm just wondering if you could weigh in sort of at a high level on those items. -- Sure. So let me try to take those in the order you asked them. So first of all, I think the general macroenvironment has been and continues to be positive. There is a hardening in the market, especially around some of the commercial lines.Over the years, we have distanced our pricing from the actual premium. So if you have this history, I will tell you we are much more thoughtful about long-term contracts and -- but there is a little bit of a pull associated with more premium, and there's more utility of the solutions. So there's a little more value on pricing that we would gain. But I think the bigger macro trend is as the markets harden, everyone is kind of focused on the top line and growing it profitably.So the use of our solutions, I think, continues to expand. People look to go into different lines and grow. And purchase is more easily -- it's easier to get through procurement in an environment where growth is happening. So those are kind of the general trends affect us inside the market.And I would also tell you, from a macro perspective, the industry is very much focused on big data analytics. So we're right in the wheelhouse there. They're focused on automation. They're trying to become more efficient.There's a lot of technology projects in search of automation. That works to our advantage as well. And finally, where we're trying to play more is inside the world of digitization. They're trying to make sure that their digital engagement with their policyholders continues to grow, and we have some solutions that help them.I don't want to make this too long. On the sort of reinsurance side, we do see an opportunity, or at least more consolidation among reinsurers. When that happens, it does cause a little bit of a challenge as we kind of renegotiate with the combined entity. But generally, we have seen increased engagement with insurers and reinsurers and on the extreme event modeling side of things.So, there has been kind of a little bit of a turn where people are coming and moving toward our AR models, and that is a broad kind of industry trend that we are very happy with, and I think they recognize the power of the Touchstone platform that Scott was referring to earlier. I hope that responds to your question. -- Thank you.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of George Tong. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Scott, with respect to the EagleView ruling, you've indicated that you're working to adjust the cost structure of Geomni.My understanding is that Geomni is running at a loss. Just to confirm, are you planning to taper your breakout investment spend in Geomni or are you planning to stay the course, but redirect your investments elsewhere in aerial imagery? -- So George, thanks for the question. So the -- as we described, recognizing that we have this impact on the roof report revenue, our objective is to look for efficiencies that we can achieve related to that dimension of the business. And again, that's just a part of the business in order to minimize impact of that revenue -- the revenue loss. At the same time, as Scott described, our commitment to the technology, our investment in the broader application of that business will continue.So we're trying to accomplish both of those, maintaining that commitment, exploring the other applications and developing those dimensions while, at the same time, offsetting as much as possible on that loss of revenue. -- Very helpful. Thank you.Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Campbell. Your line is open. -- yes. Good morning. Just kind of a follow-up question on the Geomni question before. Is there -- I'm assuming that the margins are lower in the Geomni roof than your legacy P&C business.So what do -- like kind of the rightsizing of this business, would that be accretive for insurance segment margins? -- Well, we're not making a forward statement about where the margins are going. But what I will say is it has been a category of heavy investment on our part. And one of the things I was trying to emphasize in my comments upfront is we've climbed well up that mountain because we made a lot of investments in image capture. We now have a national image capture capability. -- And I would confirm your assumption that on some of the non-roof report legacy businesses that those were positive margin businesses and that the -- in development on the roof report, given the scaling up of those expenses, we're -- as we've indicated before, had a negative impact overall to our margins as we we ran investment phase. So I think that observation is accurate. -- OK. Thanks.[Operator instructions] Next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi. Your line is open. -- Hi. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what the second shelf that you're referring to. It looks like -- either from a margin or cash flow perspective. And what are the puts and takes on the margin side as we head into 2020? -- Yes. So maybe, Lee, you'd like to conclude and respond to that. But I'll just open by saying that there are really sort of two discrete things that go on as we hit these shelves. So one of them is, and I'm pretty sure we've talked about this before, there's been a mainframe intensity to the way that we compute at Verisk.That's because of our long legacy as an extremely data-rich company. And when this company first got going, the mainframe configuration was very definitely the logical way to try to manage large data sets. But that's not true anymore. There has been change there.So one of the shelf-creating developments is when we retire mainframe capacity, and that is an ongoing activity. So that's one. And then the second is when we close data centers, and that also will contribute shelves at moments in time as we go forward. So there are really no trade-offs, actually.I mean, and as I've said before, obviously, we build in a linear way the cost associated with cloud computing. But when I say there are no trade-offs, I'm really saying two things. One is the unit economics of computing in the cloud are just superior, period. But the second thing is actually, and Lee mentioned this when he took on the topic before, and we actually are taking the opportunity to think about the very nature of our platforms.Literally, how does the calculation work? And as we move things up into the cloud, we're actually sort of peeling open the applications and reconsidering, you do this, you do this, then you do that, are there ways to be more efficient in capacity. So it's actually a very constructive exercise. We just have to -- we have to continue to be very in touch with the way that the algorithms tool and the way that the -- the very nature of our data on how we put together our data sets. So there are no trade-offs.And actually, it's constructive microeconomically. It's constructive in terms of responsiveness to customers. And actually, we're just treating it as a journey to tighten up a lot of things about the way that we operate. -- And the only thing that maybe I'll add is that as we -- as you think about those tiers or shelves, there's a lot of investment that's required to do it right, right? You need to make sure you tune the application. So you use the cloud properly, so you don't overuse the processing time and effort. And as you transition, besides kind of this code rewrite, you're also taking advantage of cheaper database management systems and things like that. So there's a ramp-up of cost before you see the benefit, and some of those are kind of trading off inside of our P&L and capex, and I just want to share that perspective with you about the timing of the shells. -- Got it. Anything numerical from a quantitative perspective on what the margins -- what this means for margins going forward? I would assume with Geomni kind of continuing to be more and more profitable and the data centers shifts going on and you moving toward the second shelf, that the margins would naturally start to improve, but I just don't want to get ahead of myself from a modeling perspective. Thanks. -- Yes. So let me try to kind of give some context around that. So I think what you heard in Scott and Mark's comments are that yes, there certainly is a cost savings in terms of achieving the shelves but also is kind of the net effect of taking on the cloud costs and then also optimizing the business. And so there is a complicated dimension to this.I want to underscore one thing. There clearly is a margin opportunity for us, but it consists both of greater opex efficiency but also overall improvement in the operating leverage of the business itself in terms of what the applications can do, their ability to integrate other data and expand that. And again, adding another layer of complexity, we have a large number of products in businesses that we are moving to the cloud, each with different dimensions of how applicable cloud is to what they do and with different time lines. And so it is impossible to extract what the quantum of that margin improvement is.We're learning as we go with each individual project, tackling the biggest ones first. But we will see that positive margin improvement that we manage as part of our overall core objective of increasing margin over time and then also investing that margin expansion to some level where we are investing in future growth. So there are a lot of contributing influences to that, but it is clearly a very strong component of what will allow us to grow core operating leverage further. I know it would be great if we could provide some quantification, but it's just too large a project and too complex for us to pin that to a specific number.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington. Your line is open. -- Good morning, everyone. -- Hi. -- So a question for you on financial services. The -- just wanted to ask about the product pushouts, whether those go into Q4 or whether they're going into 2020 or is it indefinite? And then sort of along those lines, on the EDM transition to more of a subscription model, what inning are we in there? -- So, Bill, on the pushouts, I think we had some of the third quarter revenues. Some of them are longer development products that got pushed out into the fourth quarter. There were some that I think they pushed out into 2020, so I think a combination there. And with regard to EDM, I think it is still a development project for us.So, I mean -- we continue to see a very strong response from customers. And we're dealing with really substantiating this as a broader opportunity within the business on a client-by-client basis. So very early stage, but everything that we have seen continues to keep us enthusiastic about this as a core service that is additive to our most important and largest clients. -- Well, thank you very much. -- Thank, Bill.Thank you. [Operator instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, you may proceed. -- Yes. Thank you. So thanks, everybody, for joining us. Appreciate the questions, and the dialogue.We'll be following up with several of you, and talk to you soon.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new June 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $130.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $148.76/share today.

Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 78%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.04% return on the cash commitment, or 4.72% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $148.76/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.02% if the stock gets called away at the June 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.18% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 25%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 23%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $148.76) to be 18%.

he solar market has seen  ebbs and flows over the past decade, and right now, utility-scale solar appears to be the hottest business in town. According to the  from Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association, the utility-scale pipeline has hit an all-time high of 37.9 gigawatts (GW), enough to power 6.2 million homes.As the pipeline grows, developers and solar manufacturers have a lot riding on who is winning projects. Tens of billions of dollars are at stake over the next few years.Image source: Getty Images.Investors wouldn't have thought that the solar industry would be hitting records with a fairly hostile Trump administration in power, but that's what's happening today. Corporate buyers looking for stability in electricity costs and some green energy kudos from consumers and investors are signing projects at a record pace, and utilities are starting to see solar bids so low they can't be ignored.In the first six months of 2019, 11.2 GW of utility-scale solar projects have been announced, and 17% of those were from corporate buyers. As recently as 2016, corporate buyers were only 10% of the market and passed just a bit more than 1 GW of projects, a level that's already been surpassed.On the utility side, solar is winning on the price of electricity. Prices for power purchase agreements have ranged from $0.018 to $0.035 per kWh for electricity, according to the report, which would beat any new fossil fuel plant. Solar is now the most economical choice for utilities, and 55% of the 11.2 GW of new projects signed in 2019 are based on economic drivers for utilities.Two groups are emerging as winners in the solar market. One is the manufacturers that make the products that are going into these developments. 's  take is almost entirely derived from utility-scale projects, and the U.S. is its main market, so the company should do well over the next few years. It's a little concerning that bookings were just 2.2 GW in the first half of 2019, the same as shipments, but bookings did pick up to 2.1 GW in the first few weeks of the third quarter.  hasn't been a big name in utility-scale projects lately, but its newly acquired manufacturing plant in Oregon isn't hit by tariffs on solar imports, which should make it more cost competitive. Its P-Series product coming from China may also be able to compete in the U.S. utility-scale market in the long term.Another big name to watch is  , a maker of solar panels. The company is one of the biggest solar manufacturers in the world, and its growth depends on winning big contracts for utility-scale projects. If the U.S. is booming, it bodes well for the rest of the world.Another beneficiary of a growing number of solar assets is the group of companies that finance solar projects, primarily .  ,  , and    are three of the  and financiers in the world, and they'll have a growing pool of assets to acquire.Yieldcos need a constant flow of assets to grow their dividends, so this feeder system of solar farms will be good for them over the long haul.Large-scale solar energy is growing at a time when the political winds don't favor renewable energy, and that's great news for the industry. Corporations and utilities are seeing the value and cost savings renewable energy brings, and that's what's driving the industry, not subsidies. Maybe this time around, the growth in solar energy will be sustainable.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and First Solar wasn't one of them!

There are 9 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $124.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $171.00.  The standard deviation is $15.605.


But the whole reason to look at the average VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $156.44/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $156.44 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: PWB), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $52.95 per unit.


With PWB trading at a recent price near $48.19 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.89% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of PWB's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Veeva Systems Inc (Symbol: VEEV), UnitedHealth Group Inc (Symbol: UNH), and Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK). Although VEEV has traded at a recent price of $140.85/share, the average analyst target is 25.67% higher at $177.00/share. Similarly, UNH has 13.30% upside from the recent share price of $250.52 if the average analyst target price of $283.83/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting VRSK to reach a target price of $158.18/share, which is 12.36% above the recent price of $140.78. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VEEV, UNH, and VRSK:  

   Combined, VEEV, UNH, and VRSK represent 6.33% of the Invesco Dynamic Large Cap Growth ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:


*/
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

That's not the case with an oil-field services company I recently came across, however -- Liberty -- which provides hydraulic fracturing services to oil and gas exploration and production companies in the continental United States.With $99 million in trailing profits and a market cap of $1.7 billion, Liberty Oilfield Services sports an attractive price-to-earnings ratio of just 17. (That's attractive , according to analysts polled by , Liberty is on pace to grow its earnings more than 60% over the next two years -- a compounded annual growth of better than 30%.)And allaying my perhaps idiosyncratic concerns about the relationship between reported and cash profits, Liberty's trailing free cash flow number of $100 million almost precisely matches its reported net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).Granted, Liberty isn't as cheap as it seems at first blush. The company carries about $160 million in net debt on its balance sheet. But just this month, Liberty announced  of shares calculated to raise some $118 million in new cash -- enough to pay off the company's debt almost entirely, should management so desire.With an attractive valuation and debt reduced effectively to zero, I think this sets up Liberty Oilfield Services stock to outperform in July. Three-year-old liquefied natural gas (LNG) company Tellurian has big dreams, but not a lot to show for them...yet. It was founded by industry insiders, and the company's goal is to become a heavyweight in the production, transportation, storage, and export of liquefied natural gas. I'm highlighting the company now, in July, because the thesis on Tellurian makes it better to buy now than later.Here's why: Tellurian is  of getting regulatory approvals and funding for a major new LNG pipeline/export facility project called Driftwood. The big regulatory hurdles have pretty much been cleared, but now the company is trying to pull in financing. Right now, French big oil company has stepped up with a $500 million equity investment and about $407 million more in additional purchasing guarantees, but that's a drop in the bucket compared to the $7.5 billion more Tellurian needs from project partners and the additional $20 billion in financing it requires. Still, investment tends to beget more investment, and that Total is officially signed on to the project may make it easier for Tellurian to sign on more partners. If Tellurian makes a Final Investment Decision, though, or announces another big new partner, shares are likely to rise. That's why investors  to buy in now. Again, this is a speculative investment, so it's probably not a good idea to put all your eggs in this LNG basket, or to invest money you can't afford to lose. But the energy trends are working in Tellurian's favor here, so even though it's a risk, the potential reward makes it worth considering for the right investors. There aren't many sure things in solar energy, but two we can count on are long-term installation growth as the cost of building power plants falls and First Solar being an industry leader. The company has been ahead of the competition for two decades, and with a balance sheet that's the envy of every solar competitor, there's no reason to think the company won't be a winner over the long term. Despite continuing an upgrade in manufacturing equipment this year, management expects to report an industry-leading gross margin of 18% to 19% on sales of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and earnings of $2.25 to $2.75 per share. As most solar companies struggle to make any money, First Solar is pumping out cash even when it's not operating at 100% capacity. Not only will the company make money, management expects a net cash balance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion at the end of the year. The best news lately for First Solar has been improvement in the U.S. market, which is where it generates the majority of its revenue. After two years of pressure because of changing political winds, the U.S. market is getting more bullish. Total solar installations in the U.S. are expected to  (GW), according to Wood Mackenzie. It expects installations to be 16.4 GW per year by 2021, with about two-thirds of installations coming in First Solar's dominant utility-scale segment. The contracted pipeline of utility-scale projects in the U.S. is now 27.7 GW, and announced projects add another 51.1 GW to the pipeline. The news continues to get better, too, with Wood Mackenzie upping First Solar's projected utility-scale solar installations from 2019 to 2024 by 5.1 GW in the last quarter alone. First Solar is a bright spot in solar energy, and that's why it's my top solar stock today. No matter whether you think fossil fuels or renewable energy is the future of energy, there's something here for everyone. And with energy use growing overall, they could all be big winners in the long term. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and First Solar wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@3 Top Energy Stocks to Buy This Month@2019-07-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-energy-stocks-to-buy-this-month-2019-07-22

There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $124.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $171.00.  The standard deviation is $16.4.


But the whole reason to look at the average VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $152.10/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $152.10 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:



The average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.  This article used .  .

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new March 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $150.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $142.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $151.72/share today.

Because the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% return on the cash commitment, or 7.67% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.50.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $151.72/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.11% if the stock gets called away at the March 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has been attached to an 8-K that has been furnished to the SEC.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Verisk Analytics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.  -- Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Verisk delivered another strong quarter marked by solid 7.2% organic constant-currency revenue growth, which remains the most important measure of the health of our organization. Moreover, our growth was driven by continued broad-based strength in our insurance segment, as well as marked improvement in our financial services segment.At Verisk, it is our people that drive innovation, provide a great customer experience and are critical to delivering our consistent and solid financial results. As such, we are keenly focused on maintaining an environment that attracts and retains the best talent through strong recruitment, leading talent development programs and management training efforts, which ultimately results in highly engaged employees. I'm pleased to share that employee engagement at Verisk is on an upward trend, improving 2 percentage points from 2018. At the same time, we have maintained retention of our top performers at over 92% in each of the last three years in what is a very competitive labor market for our kind of talent.From a recruiting perspective, this summer, we are hosting our largest class of interns ever with 119 interns across all our business units who can serve as a pipeline for permanent hires. On training and development front, we are investing in our future by hiring talent earlier in the talent pipeline and training them ourselves instead of competing for experienced talent. As such, we have expanded our global data science excellence program, which is an internal four-plus year rotational training program for data scientists with a Masters in Data Science or Data Analytics. We have also extended training programs for talent in key areas, including cloud architecture and artificial intelligence.We have enhanced our management training programs to include offerings for first-line managers, as well as experienced leaders and have expanded our online education offerings in data science and analytics in connection with leading universities such as Johns Hopkins and University of Michigan. Lastly, as part of our global talent optimization strategy, during the second quarter, we opened a new office in Krakow, Poland. This office focuses on data science and analytics talents, and we are seeing early success building out this team and have a strong pipeline of talent interested in joining Verisk. On the client engagement front, in June, we hosted Verisk Vision in London, our client conference tailored to the London and European markets.We hosted approximately 300 attendees for a day-long event that focused on the ongoing transformation in the insurance landscape and covered areas, including risk, claims and InsurTech, such as cyber risk, artificial intelligence, antifraud analytics and digital transformation. The event also featured the Verisk innovation lab, which showcased product demos featuring new technologies and industry applications, which incorporate cutting-edge deals such as social media, image forensics, security and surveillance, aerial imagery and entity resolution. The event not only solidifies our position as an InsurTech thought leader, but it also strengthens our position as a key technology and data partner to the London and European insurance companies. On the innovation front, we're seeing great success in gaining market share in personal lines due to strong sales of our LightSpeed suite of products.LightSpeed helps our insurance customers compete in the digital age as it utilizes innovative data-forward advanced analytics that enable insurers to provide a fully bindable quote on just three simple pieces of information. This addresses our customers' dual needs to both increase the velocity and efficiency of their operations by increasing the precision of their underwriting analytic. The result is more profitable conversion rates for our customers. Personal auto automation has led the way in this growth, quickly followed by personal property and small commercial.At Wood Mackenzie, we continue to be encouraged by the early results of our data analytic platform called Lens. We have a strong pipeline of interest and continue to sign up new subscriptions with major oil companies, independents and global investment banks. Additionally, we are seeing solid double-digit growth in both visits and unique users to the platform. We continue to work in partnership with our customers to deliver an offering that is unique in the marketplace, one that is scalable, dynamic and integrated into their workflows.We plan to have the next module, global upstream valuations, for the Lens platform by year-end 2019, which we think will be very well received by the market. And in financial services, we're seeing great success with our merchant analytics platform, which Lisa will talk to you about in more detail. Finally, we continue to be engaged on the strategic acquisition front with a focus on finding high return on invested capital transactions that leverage our scale, existing resource and deep domain expertise. We recently announced the acquisition of Keystone Aerial Surveys.Keystone is a leading aerial survey company with operations that cover the entire United States. Keystone will become part of Geomni, and it demonstrates our commitment to becoming a leader in aerial imagery, property analytics and geospatial data solutions. The addition of Keystone will accelerate our nationwide inventory coverage network and improve our refresh rate as we strive to bring our customers the most innovative and technologically superior geospatial solutions. And now I'll turn the call over to Lisa to provide some insights on our financial services segment. -- Thank you, Scott. I'm excited to have the opportunity to provide you with an update on Verisk Financial Services, our business unit built through the combination of the legacy Argus platform with acquisitions that added capabilities and expanded our solution sets. Now that I've been in the role of president, Verisk Financial, for just over a year, it's a great time to discuss the progress we've made over the past 12 months, provide an update on our key strategic initiatives and share our vision for the future. To start, I think it's important to take a step back to better understand where Verisk Financial Services is in our evolution and where we're headed.At the start of 2017, the financial services segment of Verisk consisted of the Argus business, which is a data contributory consortia business working with the leading banks and payment companies around the globe, including the top 30 credit card issuers in North America, the U.K. and Australia. Argus offers our customers unique solutions such as tracking and measurement of over $2 trillion worth of consumer spending annually, as well as industry benchmarking and portfolio profitability analytics. Throughout 2017, we made several business acquisitions that aligned from a strategic and financial perspective and added capabilities to our existing services.In early 2018, we dedicated significant attention to integrating the acquired companies from an operating perspective, and we began creating a unified go-to-market presence under the Verisk Financial brand. In May of 2018, the management team went through a comprehensive strategic analysis of each of our solutions within Verisk Financial. We examined critically and dispassionately what Verisk Financial was doing very well and where we could improve. Based on this analysis, we developed an integrated strategic plan for the business.The first change, which many of you may recall from our December Investor Day, was to align our go-to-market strategy around four solution sets. The first of these is portfolio management solutions, our legacy consortia-based products, which provide industry benchmarking and portfolio profitability analysis for credit cards, payments and retail banking customers around the globe. Second is credit risk and fraud management solutions, our portfolio of bankruptcy and merchant acquirer risk solutions and our new suite of fraud solutions for our banking clients. The third is spend analytics and marketing solutions, which encompasses our cards' marketing models, consumer and merchants' insights and media measurement solutions.And finally, enterprise data management solutions, comprised of our global regulatory reporting platform and client-specific data management, MIS, and data advisory solutions. I'm happy to report that one year in, we're seeing the benefits of this solution-based orientation beginning to pay off. There is momentum in each of our solution sets with particularly strong performance from our media measurement, merchant analytics and portfolio management solutions during the first half of the year. And while enterprise data management is a newer and developing business for Verisk, which tends to have more quarter-to-quarter variability, we are experiencing sequentially improving trends with the introduction of some of our key strategic initiatives in that area.And in addition to reorienting our business, we've also implemented a number of operational improvements, including strengthening and reorganizing our sales team around the four solution sets for more comprehensive and holistic go-to-market sales strategy and implementing Lean Six Sigma and process automation. These changes have already created significant benefits to our business. For example, our process improvements for portfolio benchmark reporting have led to a 35% reduction in processing time each month. And the automation of report summarization module alone for benchmarking led to a laborsaving of 200 hours from us, allowing us to free up resources for new product development efforts.We believe that the investment in time to improve our operations ultimately creates a better environment for our innovation and growth. As we brought several smaller businesses together with our Argus platform, we've also made some key strategic decisions. We have rationalized head count and updated our client pricing structure for our enterprise data management offerings based in India. We have reduced our reliance on business opportunities that led to one-time, short-term revenues in favor of longer-term subscription-based growth.And most recently, we sold our Verisk retail loss prevention business as it was no longer fit within our new Verisk Financial strategic road map. Collectively, these decisions have led to a stronger, more aligned Verisk Financial Services unit that is better positioned for future growth. As we look forward, we're ready to embark on the next phase of our business transformation. In addition to our relentless commitment to continuously improving our customer experience and our existing solutions, we are focused on long-term strategic growth, which is underpinned by the key strategic initiatives that we share during our Investor Day.These include introducing our next-generation benchmarking platform, expanding our spend analytics solutions globally, building our fraud solutions beginning with the fraud consortia in Mexico, advancing our cloud migration and developing a global regulatory analytic platform as part of our enterprise data management solutions. All of these initiatives are under way, meeting key milestones and beginning to deliver. Of particular note, we are getting extremely strong market interest in the Mexico cards fraud consortia, which will deliver our first new consortia data set since 2016 when we launched the Australian card study, and the global regulatory platform as regulators around the globe embrace a data-driven approach to oversight. Our experience working with the OCC, the Fed and the CFPB in the U.S., as well as our work through the Lloyd's syndicates in the U.K.uniquely position us to meet the needs of both regulators and their regulated entities. In addition to these Verisk Financial strategic initiatives, we are also accelerating a cross-Verisk collaboration, working with our colleagues in the insurance segment. We are currently working with our partners in underwriting and rating on enhancing lead generation and market prospecting, as well as working with our colleagues in claims to elaborate on enhanced fraud solution. In summary, I'm proud of our team and the progress we've made over the past year as we have synthesized a series of acquisitions to create Verisk Financial Services, a single cohesive operating unit.We have made tangible progress choosing long-term vision with near-term operating execution. Our bias is to action with the understanding that a world-class business isn't created overnight, but is instead the sum total of numerous incremental changes and consistent execution over time. We are confident in our long-term growth potential and look forward to sharing additional progress with -- updates with you in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. -- Thanks, Lisa. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Presentation provides background, data trends and analysis to support our conversation today. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and a GAAP basis, revenue grew 8.5% to $653 million.Net income decreased 2% to $150 million while diluted GAAP EPS declined 1.1% to $0.90 per share for the second-quarter 2019. As we previewed on last quarter's earnings call, both GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS were negatively impacted by the acceleration of $6 million in stock-based compensation in the quarter. Let's now focus our quarterly discussion on our organic constant-currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, nonoperating acquisition-related costs, including earnouts, dispositions and nonrecurring items. We believe these are the best measures to evaluate the health of our overall business and are the metrics we use in our own compensation plans.On an organic constant-currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 7.2% in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth across all three segments and delivering on our long-term target of 7% growth. Growth was led by our Insurance segment, and we also delivered improving trends in Financial Services. Organic constant-currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% and was 7.3% after normalizing for the accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.6%, down from the 47.9% in the prior year primarily the result of the acceleration of stock-based compensation which decreased margins by approximately 1%.This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions decreased total adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 20 basis points in the period. The headwind from the acceleration of stock-based compensation is also reflected in the individual segment results as these costs have been allocated based on revenue contribution to Verisk. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant-currency basis.As you see in the press release, insurance reported 7.8% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 5.1%. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was balanced across personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. We're seeing strong uptake of our new innovative solutions, including LightSpeed auto, as our new data-forward products are designed to meet the needs of our Insurance customers for quicker, more efficient and easier to use solutions.Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in claims analytics, repair cost estimating and remote imagery solutions. This was offset in part by modest weakness in workers' compensation claim resolution services. Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 140 basis points to 53% from 54.4% in the prior-year period. Energy and specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 5.5% for the quarter.Strong sales of market and cost intelligence solutions drove the growth. We also had positive contributions from core research and our environmental health and safety business. This was offset in part by softness in our consulting services related to strong performance from last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7%, reflecting, ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and power and renewables breakouts.Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 29.9% from 31.8%. The largest factor in that margin decline was a nonoperational foreign currency translation loss. Excluding this item, margin in the segment would have been flat. Financial Services revenue increased 6.1% in the quarter led by solid growth in portfolio management and spend-informed marketing solutions revenues.As Lisa mentioned earlier, these improving results reflect the impact of the strategy that we implemented in 2018 to transition Verisk Financial Services from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth. We expect that investors will continue to see more clearly the long-term growth potential of this segment over time as we continue to make progress with the transition. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.9%, and total adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 31.9% from 30.3%. Strong focus on expense management, as well as leverage from the revenue growth drove the margin expansion.Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter, down 4.7% from the prior-year quarter due to the net repayments of our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.5 billion at June 30, 2019, down from $2.7 billion at year-end 2018. And our leverage at the end of the second quarter was 2.1 times. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $153 million at June 30, 2019.Our reported effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter, compared to 17% in the prior-year quarter primarily due to a lower level of option exercises. We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full-year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $184 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.10 for the second quarter, up 4.1% and 4.8%, respectively. After normalizing for the impact of the incremental stock-based compensation, diluted adjusted EPS would have grown 8.6%.This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a decrease in interest expense and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $200 million for the quarter, down 3.4% from the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $566 million year to date, up 6% from the prior year.Capital expenditures were $47 million for the quarter, down 16.4% from the prior year. Capex represented 7.2% of total revenue, reflecting the expected decline in capital intensity as the result of reduced capital spending on the Geomni initiative following its initial ramp-up. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $220 million to $240 million for 2019. The free cash flow was $153 million for the quarter, an increase of 1.5% from the prior year.Free cash flow was $474 million year to date, an increase of 9.1% from the prior year. During the second quarter, we returned $91 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 361,000 shares at a weighted average price of $138.32 for a total cost of $50 million. At June 30, 2019, we had $303 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.In addition, we initiated a new $75 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the third quarter. On June 28, 2019, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. And on July 24, 2019, our board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on September 30, 2019, for shareholders of record on September 13, 2019. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. -- Operator, we're ready for questions.[Operator instructions] And you do have a question from Toni Kaplan. -- Good morning. Just taking a step back, you've had margin contraction in Insurance for the past 10 quarters, and you've been investing and experiencing an impact from dilutive acquisitions. But at some point, perhaps we could see that reverse. And so just given operating leverage of the business overall, I guess at what point do you think that we could start to see some margin leverage in Insurance specifically? -- Thank you. So Toni, thanks for the question. I think we've been focused on those -- on the year-over-year results. And so I -- when we look at this quarter's year-over-year performance from a margin standpoint, I think it's important to understand that if you take the timing -- compensation timing impact of about 1%, the margin in the second quarter of 53% would have been 54% versus 54.4% in the prior-year period.And so that certainly is I would -- we would describe as flattish. And at the same time, recognizing that we have been making some significant investments in Geomni and telematics that have been accelerated as we've ramped up in particular, Geomni. And so we are making those investments with the expectation that those will be contributing to our margin improvement over time as we reach scale in those businesses. So I think it's the financial dimension, and I'll turn it over to Mark to provide some additional color here. -- Sure. I'll echo the investment we're making. I think the thing that I always like to emphasize is that inside the investment, what we have seen is our top line organically growing quicker, which means our bottom-line EBITDA cash flow is growing quicker. So I think that's been successful.We have been disciplined in the way we spend and invest. And I think there is scale clearly in the business as we take on pretty big investment in something like aerial imagery and IoT. So I just want to provide a little bit of color that I think we've had quite a bit of success in the growth side of things. -- Excellent. Thank you.Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik. -- Yeah. Hi, good morning. I guess since you have Lisa on the call, maybe I can just ask on the Argus comments. I think there was a comment about updating the pricing structure to more subscription-based revenue, and that might have been specific to the EDM business based in India.So I was wondering if you can just elaborate on that with some context on how much of Argus today is subscription. And are there any other areas there that you could see similar pricing structure updates? -- Sure. It is -- there were two things. The first is that as we've begun integrating the companies that we acquired, the business that we acquired in India, we did go through a rigorous review of all of their solutions and the pricing for those solutions relative to our investment in those solutions. Based on that, we have updated our pricing structure for solutions-based set of India.Those are primarily subscription-based solutions. In addition, across all of the Argus business, we have also been changing and shifting our mix toward more subscription-based and product-driven solutions as opposed to one-time implementations or initial development revenue upfront and more heavily weighted in the current year. As we implement some of our data analytic solutions, the enterprise data management solutions, we're now orienting those to more of a longer-term subscription base as well. So in all the things that we're doing, we're looking for longer-term subscription-based revenue.Today, the percentage of revenue that's subscription-based is over 65%, close to 70%. We continue to move that up.Your next question comes from Tim McHugh. -- Thanks. Just wondered on LightSpeed. You highlighted that this quarter. So can you talk about how customers are adopting that? Is that displacing prior methods of kind of underwriting and acquiring customers? Or is it used -- being used as an incremental? And then I think recently, you talked about taking Sequel to the U.S., which I believe is a new initiative.So I guess talk about the plans and how aggressively you're pursuing that. -- Great. Thanks, and this is Mark. So let me first talk a little bit about LightSpeed. Inside of the insurance process, there has typically been a two-step process.First, you provide a quote, and then people run what is typically all the reports and gather the information. There's a cost there before they bind the policy. So what we have attempted to do inside of our kind of ecosystem is create a very automated approach so they can flow this business, that's a term of ours, they can be completely automated, more accurate, more efficient. And we're bringing all the data needs upfront.We call it our data-forward strategy. So that represents kind of a different way of going to -- go to market. You can actually provide a quote, bind it all in one. Just an example, you talked about digital engagement.On the personal auto front, on a car insurance, about 33% of all quotes you get online change after people do that work. So very poor experience. And what we've done is we've taken things like motor vehicle reports, loss histories, prior losses, prior coverage, all the things about the driver and brought that upfront. And that has been adopted, well accepted, and we have a nice success on the insurance front.That kind of moves across auto, the homeowners and even into small commercial. That is our theme, and that's where we're headed. I'm going to now flip over to the question on Sequel. Just to remind everybody, Sequel solution set which is, for the most part, all of the software to a service policy, starting from the upfront, within underwriting on to claims, all of that very much a industry standard inside the London insurance market, primarily around things that what I'll refer to as ISO.And most of Verisk hasn't been as focused on the non-admitted market, meaning the specialty lines, the really complex risks. What we have attempted to do is use some of that technology in some of our products here. But more importantly, what you saw in the press release is for specialty or complex insurance risk, we are going to bring Sequel to the United States. We seem to have quite a bit of interest.We are leveraging the teams in place, both on the claims side and on the ISO side of the underwriting side. And I think we're very optimistic that inside that niche specialty market, we have a solution that can win today. And we're optimistic.Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman. -- Hi. It's Andrew. Could you give us a sense how your energy clients are doing as they're increasing spend with Wood Mac, which areas of interest is increasing with those energy clients? And also, you mentioned cost intelligence with energy. I assume that's around PowerAdvocate.And could you give us a sense of how PowerAdvocate is do -- again evolving within Verisk? -- Yes. So Scott here. And in reverse order, the PowerAdvocate suite is doing well. The traditional customer set for PowerAdvocate has been utilities.A lot of the motion in the business has been taking the same kind of solution into the oil and gas space, which is one of those places where PowerAdvocate is advantaged by being tied to the business with very substantial footprint we've already got in the oil and gas space. And then over on the traditional Wood Mac side in the oil and gas space, basically, there is a lot of interest in what the Lens platform provides, which is essentially more real time and more integrated into the customer workflows. And so it's essentially doing what we thought it would do, which is positioning our content even more deeply in the customer workflows. And that's the direction of travel.Basically, as the United States has sort of been differentially adding to the global supply curve, the U.S. environment is one where you're making operating decisions all the time as opposed to the traditional offshore decadal kind of investment cycle. And so the need for real time, the need for more benchmark kinds of data just goes up, and that's exactly what we've been positioning for. So it's -- one of the leading metrics there is the rate of adoption of Lens among the oil and gas companies, both the integrated globals, as well as the more pure-play E&P companies.And we're very happy with what's happening there. -- Great. Thanks, Scott.[Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee. -- Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for the detailed rundown on financial services business. It sounds like you're making a lot of progress there.I guess the key question is, how do those changes impact how we should think about the medium or longer-term growth potential of the business and maybe also profitability? Historically, before the recent couple years of challenges, I think there was clear discussion of this being the fastest growth or growing above the corporate average. Is that a reasonable and sustainable target at some point in the future based on the progress you're doing? -- Gary, this is Lee. So we -- for all three of our segments, our expectation that all of them have the ability to meet or exceed our long-term targeted 7% organic constant currency growth rate, as well as to realize the operating leverage and achieve EBITDA faster than that. And so I think one of the challenges for investors, which we certainly empathize with, is that given some of the large contracts in contract transitions in the business made it difficult to see the underlying growth within the business. And so we wanted to focus on really developing the bottoms up approach to the business that Lisa described in each of the four solutions areas.And I think in those more traditional -- in the kind of the foundational benchmarking areas, those are probably mid-single digits growth elements. And the fraud, bankruptcy, enterprise data management, marketing spend analytics are newer, higher-growth businesses that we think contribute to achieving that 7% growth. So no change in terms of our expectations of what the financial services business can achieve and can contribute to our overall growth rate, but there has been a shift in making sure that we're delivering that on a more sustainable and granular basis and that investors have greater clarity on that growth, which certainly I think within this quarter is a clear step in that direction.Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi. -- Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about Geomni and some of the potential contribution to revenues and the capex that you've put in there and what stage that's in. -- This is Mark. Let me try to address that. So the opportunity with Geomni is very much focused on, first, ensuring that we have coverage, frequent refresh of those images. And with that that library of information, our first step was really to address the claims-focused solutions in the insurance space.So literally, by using those advanced pictures and some advanced analytics, we can get measurements and do repair cost estimates for the claims departments from the sky. They then use maybe some desktop adjusting but, for the most part, a majority of that is done in a very automated fashion, saving a very significant cost to the insurers as well it's safer and more accurate. We have opportunities to bring that into underwriting, as well as to the world of cat modeling. But I want to highlight though that as much as our first use case was insurance, there's probably and there is bigger opportunities outside of the insurance space.So we have partnered up with some folks that are doing construction. We're doing work in the solar space. We're doing work across various verticals where that imagery and those exact measurements are very helpful. And Geomni is contributing nicely to that claims category inside of our growth rates for insurance.So it continues to be investment-oriented. Keystone accelerates that investment for us because it replaces what we have to buy in the form of sensors, meaning big cameras, as well as the planes. Keystone has it. They have operations.They have pilots. So this will accelerate our path to strength there. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey. -- Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Yes.I wonder and I'm thinking about LightSpeed. But broadly across your business, can you talk about the extent to which InsurTech maybe is driving some of your growth and how structural that is? And whether as you look out to the market today, that's a potential growth acceleration driver over the next year or two? -- Yes. Scott here. It has two effects on our business. So one is, if you think of InsurTech as a category of digitally enabled innovations, this is one of the things that actually our customers and all of our segments are looking for.They themselves are trying to transform their businesses making use of digital methods. And so here we are with our particular solution sets. They are rotating their budgets in the direction of making use of modern methods. So that's just a fundamentally constructive factor across everything we do basically.But in addition to that, when people refer to InsurTech, partly what they're talking about are new companies that are basically using digital methods fundamentally to change the distribution of insurance, the sourcing of insurance, customers presenting the insurance product to the end user. And so these are some of the companies that get celebrated as start-ups that are -- sort of kind of present a new face to the insurance-consuming world. We've done very well with those companies as customers. So here they are.They're inventing a new insurance company. And we find that they just -- that they have voted with their feet and basically want to use our industry-standard solutions so that they have the benefit of efficiency, fighting fraud in effective way. One of the big issues you have when you emerge as an insurance company is you don't have a lot of experience. And so how are you going to anticipate where your losses are going to be and at what level? That's one of the things that our solutions just give you right out of the box.So it's really gratifying to see how many of them come our way when they form and then all of a sudden -- and I've had a chance to visit with the CEO -- even recently with the CEOs of some of these highly celebrated, emergent insurance companies. And they just -- they really, really like being a partner with Verisk.And your next question comes from Jeff Meuler. -- Yeah. Thanks. Scott, I was just hoping you could extend your earlier comments around kind of human capital and the opening of the Krakow office. You relatively, I guess, acquired Wood Mac.And one of the points from the acquisition was expanding your global office footprint, but I know data nationalism always top of mind. So just roughly, what percentage of your data and analytics and tech head count or innovation head count is in the United States or more expensive labor markets today? Like how big is this long-term opportunity as a margin enhancement for you? -- Yes. So the first thing that motivates us on this is access to talent. That's the thing that this is really about. So the reason we like Krakow so much is, as we expand our business in Europe, especially Continental Europe, having high-quality, technically deep people who also will get steeped in the verticals that we serve, having them right there to interact more easily with our customers is a really, really nice feature here.And then I'm glad you picked up on the point I was making about talent because that really is the wellspring for our company. And there's no question that everybody -- we have about 9,000 associates at Verisk now. Everybody really counts. There are some of the technical disciplines that are the ones that are particularly in demand.I ticked off a few of those, so being able to make cloud architectures that are secure and really work, sort of data science as in the transformation of the data. There's also a big data engineering dimension always to what it is we do. And so there's no question that over the last couple of years as we have built those communities of people around Verisk differentially, the additions have been overseas between what we do on -- in Continental Europe, both in Spain and in -- now in Poland, we have added quite a few people in India. And so as a percentage of the additions to the team that we've made, they're coming more not in the United States than in the United States of late.Of course, we're building both sides but relatively, it's even more overseas. And I don't see that changing. But it's -- and it is constructive from a cost point of view as well. But to me, that's just a marker actually of supply and demand.And we're just trying to make sure that we are in as many places as a, we intend to serve; and b, can provide great talent. And the last thing I'll just emphasize again is the develop ourselves mentality that we have here. We feel very rewarded for having gone in a direction that I think by degree is at least is a little bit different than what some other companies do. Because several years ago, we recognized if we're just going to count on our ability to go into the market and hire already experienced people, we're essentially saying we're going to let somebody else solve our challenge, the talent challenge.And we said, ""Well, no. We can do better than that."" And so we've just gone very early into the talent pipeline. And we have felt very rewarded doing that.[Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the Bill Warmington. -- Good morning, everyone. -- Good morning. -- And so the acquisition of Keystone last week brought to the front the question of how much coverage of the U.S. do you have now? And is that enough? Because you've been -- I know you've been talking about going into Japan and Asia. So in that context, I want to see how much is left to go in the U.S. And then as you look out internationally, is this going to be the beginning of a new investment cycle in geospatial for Asia? And how much you think it'll be? And how long do you think it'll take? -- So Mark, you may want to add to this, but I'll just kick off. So in the United States, we are approaching what we would consider full coverage now. You have to understand coverage as both the square miles that you are imaging, but also the frequency with which you are imaging them. And so with respect to will we be able to reach all the important corners of the United States, we're very, very close to being there.With respect to the frequency of the refresh, that may always be something of a moving target. These data sets are not commodities. And one of the ways that you make them to have the quality of not being a commodity is the freshness of the data. So we will always be taking account of customer needs and competition in order to determine how frequently are we refreshing the images.So when you think about coverage, you have to think about both of those. With respect to overseas markets, we actually already do, do some of this work in other places. And basically, the methods that we develop, the ability of the team to automatically interpret the image sets, that works everywhere. So as we build out our franchise generally -- and insurance is one of the killer apps for the -- for remote imagery.As we build out the Insurance franchise globally, I think it's very clear we will want to come in behind with these methods. But it'll -- it's -- we still got plenty of room to run in the United States, and then we will sort of build it I think organically and consistently with the rate that our Insurance franchise grows outside of the United States. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from George Tong. -- Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Historically, enterprise data management and fraud solutions were the two underperforming areas within financial services.This quarter, all solution sets within financial services saw sequential improvement. Can you elaborate on the relative performance here and specific initiatives you'd call out that should drive continued acceleration in revenue growth in this segment? -- So it's true. All the segments saw sequential improvement. The enterprise data management sector is the sector that will continue to be lumpy and have variability on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those contracts are very long-term contract often delivered through RFPs.And so the sales cycle is very long, and they also -- some of them end. Some of the work that we've done on more of a client-by-client bespoke enterprise data management solutions basis end. So it's really about building a book of business there and getting to a level of sustainability that allows us to meet that level of consistent performance as we see contracts end and new contracts begin within a quarter and quarter to quarter. Continued improvement in that sector, that is a sector that we're looking to grow over the long term.And we'll continue to see lumpiness on a quarterly basis over the short term, but we do hear and continue to feel that the market is receptive to the solutions we're offering. Most particularly, we are hearing good reception to the global regulatory reporting platform. Regulators around the globe are changing the way they do their oversight. They are creating.They are leveraging deep and rich granular data to do that work, and we believe we're uniquely positioned to serve in the financial sector there.Your next question comes from Ashish Sabadra. -- Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick two-part question on the energy side. Any color on the softness in the consulting services? Is that mostly difficult comps? And then just where are we in terms of investments for the breakout opportunity within energy? And when can we start to see margin expansion in the segment? -- Yes. So go ahead, Lee. -- Again, I just-I may -- Ashish, I may just want to get clarity around the second part of the question. I had a little difficult time hearing you. So on the -- in the first element in terms of the consulting revenue, some of it was a function of a very strong second quarter in 2018. We also saw among some of the large national oil companies some political transitions that delayed some of the revenue that we had anticipated in the quarter.We do not think that that was a revenue at risk but simply a delay of some of that revenue. And then with regard to margin, if that was the question and the impact of the breakouts on the margin for energy and specialized markets, Ashish, was that the thrust of your question? -- Yes, yes, yes. That's it. -- Yes. So thanks for raising that. Within energy and specialized markets, I think it's important to note that in this second quarter that a large part of the decline in the revenue, in fact, the largest single element was an FX gain adjustment, which reduced margin by approximately 2%. That's a function of the dollar-pound exchange rate and valuation of our net current assets that influenced that.And so that would -- absent that impact, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we would have had a higher margin. In addition, that margin also bears approximately the 1% impact of the timing from a compensation standpoint. So absent those two nonoperational elements, it reflects the operating leverage and the margin expansion that we are experiencing in the core business while at the same time investing in new initiatives like Lens and the breakout areas like subsurface, power and renewables and those elements. And so I think we feel very good.This -- the quarter, the numbers are distorted by that compensation timing issue in the FX. But overall, from a pure operating standpoint, we actually saw margin expansion. And if I may, I want to emphasize this dynamic to go back to Toni's question around the Insurance side. In each of our businesses, putting aside the FX impact, as well as the timing issue, all of our insurance businesses saw an expansion in their operating margin.And so that's the underlying operating leverage that drives our margin up. And then we are deliberately making decisions from an investment standpoint with the breakouts in terms of how much of that do we want to spend down with an overall objective of increasing that margin over time. And that's -- we think that's a very healthy dynamic. It's important for continuing investment.But it's also important to understand that absent that investment, we are seeing net operating leverage and that margin expansion improve as we grow. It's just that when you look at the net number, there are various nonoperational impacts and investment impacts that are affecting that. Does that -- hopefully, that addresses your question. -- Yes. Thanks. Thanks for the call.There are no further questions at this time. -- OK. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. We've scheduled a number of follow-ups with you. We look forward to that.Thanks for your interest and talk to you soon. Have a great day.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Shares of solar manufacturer   jumped as much as 24.6% in trading Tuesday after getting an upgrade from Wall Street. Shares were hitting their daily high at 12:30 p.m. EDT. Analyst Brian Lee at  upgraded SunPower's stock from neutral to a buy rating and increased his price target from $6 to $11 per share. He said there are volume tailwinds that will drive growth, such as a  and people installing solar ahead of declining federal tax credits next year. Image source: SunPower.The upgrade coincides with a report from the SEIA and Wood Mackenzie that says the U.S. installed 2.7 gigawatts (GW) of solar in the first quarter, the most ever in the first three months of the year. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie are also increasing expected installations this year by 1.2 GW. I wouldn't read much into the upgrade from Goldman Sachs because the sentiment of Wall Street regarding solar energy can rise and fall. The more important data point is a record quarter for solar in the U.S. and a very bullish sentiment long term. If installations rise, particularly in residential markets, SunPower will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. That's a reason to own the stock long term, and it's why I'm still bullish on this leading solar stock. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and SunPower wasn't one of them!

Image source: The Motley Fool. Q1 2019 , Good day everyone, and welcome to the Verisk first-quarter 2019 earnings results conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk Head of Investor Relations Stacey Brodbar. Ms.Brodbar, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, Natalia, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first-quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, chairman, president, and chief executive officer, who will provide a brief overview of the business. In an effort to provide the investment community with a broader perspective on our industry verticals and to offer deeper access to our senior operating executives, Neal Anderson, president of Wood Mackenzie, will then provide an update on our energy and specialized market segment.Lastly, Lee Shavel, chief financial officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. Mark Anquillare, chief operating officer, will join the team for Q&A. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Verisk Analytics wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dialing. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.  -- Thanks, Stacey, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be able to report that 2019 is off to a solid start at Verisk. The first quarter was marked by solid organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.7%, which remains the most important measure of our vitality as an organization. Moreover, our growth was driven by continued broad-based strength across our insurance vertical and ongoing improvements in energy and specialized markets.This growth was a product of our continued efforts to get closer to our customers, to introduce new innovative solutions and to cross-sell existing solutions to help accelerate value creation for our customers. With regard to innovation and cross-sell, we are beginning to see early success from the integration of some of our more recent acquisitions into the Verisk family. To that end, we are leveraging technologies and capabilities across all of Verisk to deliver new innovation and leveraging client relationships to drive cross-sell. In the insurance vertical, we are working with a number of clients in the London market to help them achieve and integrated workflow across a suite of Verisk products, helping them to be more responsive to their clients while, at the same time, improving the quality of their analytics.As an example, Verisk clients who ensure commercial properties are now able to leverage integrations that we have built between the applications from SQL, AIR and Analyze Re to review exposure accumulations, assess extreme event risk and determine the impact of a policy on the overall portfolio in real time during the quoting process. These integrated products enable insurers to perform such analytics in minutes where previously it could have taken at least a day. We think this early success with clients can be replicated more broadly within London and the United States. In energy and specialized markets, PowerAdvocate, our market and cost intelligence solution is seeing early success expanding out of their core markets of oil and gas utilities into new end markets, including metals and mining, by leveraging Wood Mackenzie's deep customer relationships.Neal will talk to you about these opportunities in more detail. In the financial services vertical, we've integrated LCI's comprehensive bankruptcy data with our proprietary Argus credit card industry consortium data to more accurately predict bankruptcy as much as six to 12 months prior to a bankruptcy filing. This should enable our bank customers to significantly reduce bankruptcy losses through the appropriate utilization and credit line management strategies. We had a very active quarter with regard to customer engagement.In fact, in the quarter, we hosted 17 customer events, and attendance and engagement were very solid. In February, we hosted our Elevate conference in Salt Lake City. The attendance included almost 1,000 insurance executives, claims adjusters, contractors and vendors from the U.S., Canada and Europe. The event focused on artificial intelligence and automation to enhance the claims process and introduced the many enhanced features and new products offered by our claims team.Insurers clearly understand the disruptive innovation that is taking place throughout the industry, and they are intent on maintaining a competitive advantage. This is driving increased engagement and focus around increased use of data and analytics, as well as digital engagement. The conference featured, first, the use of computer vision such as remote imagery and image interpretation to automate the claims cycle. Second, utilizing natural language processing to better respond to policyholders through advanced analytics and chat bots to speed the claims process and better digitally engage with customers.And third, product demos of our enhanced solutions and an innovation lab to showcase our cutting edge InsurTech. The unprecedented interest in these topics resulted in over 150 requests from customers to meet with our product managers and industry experts and account executives. This level of customer engagement positions us well for future growth. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Neal to provide some additional insights on our energy and specialized market segment. -- Welcome, Neal.Thank you, Scott. It's a pleasure to be here this morning to talk to you about our energy and specialized markets business. I will discuss the macro environment in which the energy and specialized vertical operates with a focus on how our businesses are performing. I will also highlight our recent success leveraging the expertise of our PowerAdvocate business into the extensive Wood Mackenzie energy and mining customer base.And lastly, I will give you an update on the customer response to Lens with Mackenzie's new data analytic platform. Regarding the macro environment. As you are aware, the oil and gas industry has been through a very challenging time over the last few years due to the fall in oil prices. However, the industry in 2019 is in a much better shape than it was prior to the oil price crash in 2015.The oil and gas industry responded with amazing speed and focus to the drop in oil prices, aggressively cutting costs and rebuilding balance sheets, divesting non-core assets which allowed them to concentrate on low cost, long life [Inaudible]. In turn, free cash flow has become the key financial metric. Indeed, in 2018, free cash flow surpassed the previous peak seen in 2012. Then oil prices were above $100 a barrel.In summary, our oil and gas customers are in robust health, but their focus are now turning to new investments. We estimate future capital investment will exceed $200 billion in the next few years. As a result, we believe the majors [Sp] will deliver stronger production growth in the coming five years, are poised to cover stronger growth five years than pre the oil price crash. Simultaneously, our downstream refining customers are seeing continued strong demand, particularly in emerging markets, leading to new investment in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.Our core energy customers are also grappling with opportunities and challenges presented by climate change and the need for an energy transition to lower carbon energy sources. As you are aware, we have established two breakout businesses to specially support and advise our customers in these areas, namely chemicals and power in renewables. The chemicals business continues to deliver strong double-digit growth as customers recognize that the primary driver of oil demand is likely to become chemical demand over the medium and long term. This is a far cry from the world we've grown up in, where transportation demand was the key driver.This is a far cry from the world we've grown up in, where transportation demand was the key driver. Wood Mackenzie's data across the global energy complex helps our customers navigate this. The power and renewables business is also consistently delivering double-digit growth, driven by our traditional renewable developers and operators, complemented by strong demand from Wood Mackenzie's core oil and gas customers as they strive to build material positions outside their core business. We believe global investment in power and renewables will continue its nascent, rapid expansion as the energy mix moves from the molecule to the electron.As previously mentioned, the 2015 oil price crash drove a focus on cost efficiency to bring down production breakevens. Our PowerAdvocate business is ideally placed to help customers through applying cutting edge analytical techniques to diverse band data sets, allied with unique industry cost benchmarks. Wood Mackenzie has been able to expand PowerAdvocate's customer set beyond its traditional U.S. utilities to the major oil and gas customers.And more recently, into the mining and metals sector. As a result, deal sizes have increased significantly, as have margins. Lastly, I would like to talk about the market reaction to our new data analytics platform, Lens. We launched the first release of Lens late last year, namely the lower 48 upstream that focuses on exploration and production and continue to work alongside customers to develop a unique offering which is scalable, secure, mobile, dynamic, timely and integrated along the energy value chain.While we're still very much at the start of the journey, we have already secured 29 paying customers with a strong near-term pipeline of opportunities. But what is truly exciting is the quality of the anchor customers, which range from the major oil companies through to the leading independents under both bracket banks [Sp]. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. -- Thanks, Neal. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background, data, trends and analysis to support our conversation today. One change you may notice in our disclosure is that we are no longer reporting the non-GAAP measures' organic or organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA margins.As the differential between our stated and organic margins decreased, and given its complexity for investors, we have decided to simplify and just provide a single total adjusted EBITDA margin. We of course will continue to provide organic constant currency growth metrics for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as we believe these are the best measures to evaluate the health of our overall business and are the metrics we use in our own compensation plans. Finally, we have adopted the new lease standard, ASC 842, in the first quarter of 2019, and the impact to our income statement was immaterial. Moving to the financial results for the quarter.On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.5% to $625 million. Net income increased 1% to $134 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.81 for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.5% compared with the same period in 2018. GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS was impacted in the quarter by increased earn-out expense for a number of acquisitions that have been performing well relative to earn-out targets.Let's now focus our quarterly discussion on our organic constant-currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, non-operating acquisition-related costs including earnouts and non-recurring items. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 6.7% in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting strong organic growth across the insurance segment and improving results in energy and specialized markets. While below our long-term target for organic constant currency revenue growth, the results reflect the impact of some carryover non-recurring storm and implementation revenue in the prior-year period. Organic constant-currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.8%, reflecting modest EBITDA margin expansion on an organic basis.Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 46.7% was up from 46.4% in the prior-year period, reflecting the leverage in our business model and cost discipline. This increase in total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and organic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions reduced adjusted EBITDA margin by 27 basis points in the period, demonstrating our ability to absorb acquisitions and still expand margins through organic operating leverage. Let's turn now to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis.As you see in the press release, insurance reported 7.3% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 6.5%, reflecting the impact of some storm revenue in the prior-year period. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was balanced across personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics and remote imagery solutions.This was offset in part by modest weakness in workers compensation claim resolution services. Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 53 basis points to 53.1% from 53.7% in the prior-year period. This decline reflects the impact of some higher-margin storm revenue in the prior-year period in claims, which reduced current-period margin, and a negative 30-basis-point impact from acquisitions in the quarter, offset by an improvement in the underwriting and ratings margin. Our insurance margins were also negatively affected by increased legacy pension expense related to year-end 2018 market performance.Energy and specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 6.7% for the quarter, building on the trend of continuing sequential improvement. Strong growth in marketing cost intelligence solutions and core research revenues drove the growth. We also had positive contributions from our environmental health and safety and global risk analysis business. As Neal mentioned earlier, we are continuing to drive growth opportunities by leveraging our strong customer relationships in the energy industry across all of our energy businesses as we have the data and solutions that can help our customers be more efficient and effective, driving revenue growth and delivering cost savings.Adjusted EBITDA increased a healthy 14.1% despite ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and power and renewables breakouts. Total adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 29.6% from 26.8%, driven by strong leverage on revenue growth, with margin expansion at Wood Mac and the inclusion of PowerAdvocate in the organic results for energy and specialized markets. Financial services revenue increased 0.7% in the quarter, led by solid growth in spend informed analytics and portfolio management, but offset by weakness in our developing enterprise data management solutions. We continue to experience some challenging year-over-year comparisons due to some non-recurring implementation revenues in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 7.6%, and total adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 30.8% from 33.5%, also a result of some non-recurring, high-margin implementation revenues in the prior-year period. As we discussed previously, we have been transitioning Verisk financial services from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach, with an emphasis on steady growth. And this quarter represents both progress in that exercise and reflects the impact of a productivity and profitability review of individual business lines. We expect that investors will more clearly see the underlying growth and potential of the business over time as we continue with this transition.Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, down 2.7% from the prior-year quarter due to the repayment of our $250 million of 4 7/8% senior notes in January 2019 with borrowings from our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.6 billion at March 31, 2019, down from $2.7 billion at year-end 2018. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.2 times. During the quarter, we successfully issued $400 million of 4 1/8% 10-year senior notes.The transaction was oversubscribed, reflecting the strong demand for our credit and our ability to easily access the unsecured investment-grade debt capital markets. We use the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $180 million at March 31, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter compared to 18% in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a lower level of option exercises.We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full-year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $171 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.03 for the first quarter, up approximately 10% from the prior year in both cases. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate.Net cash provided by operating activities was $366 million for the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $45 million for the quarter, up 4.6% from the prior year, reflecting primarily increased software development to promote growth in organic businesses and recent acquisitions. CAPEX represented 7.2% of total revenue, reflecting the expected decline in capital intensity as the result of reduced capital spending on the Geomni initiative following its initial ramp up. Free cash flow was $321 million for the quarter, an increase of 13.1% from the prior year.During the first quarter, we returned $116 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 637,000 shares at a weighted average price of $117.82 for a total cost of $75 million. At March 31, 2019, we had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the second quarter.On March 29, 2019, we paid our first cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. And on April 29, 2019, our board of directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on June 28 for shareholders of record on June 14, 2019. Before I conclude, and looking ahead to the next quarter, I want to inform you of an accounting impact that will affect our financial results beginning next quarter. Based upon the vesting provisions in our share-based compensation plan, GAAP accounting requires that we expense the full impact of share-based compensation in the period for all employees upon the attainment of age 62 instead of amortizing the expense over the vesting term.Scott Stephenson, our CEO, will turn 62 during the second quarter of 2019. And as a result, we will incur incremental non-cash costs of approximately $6 million related to the expensing of a share-based compensation in the second quarter. That said, we will see a benefit in the remaining quarters of 2019 and into 2020. Also, on an ongoing basis, there will be a discernible concentration of compensation expense and impact on margin in the second quarter as new stock awards are granted, but this will be consistent over time and simply reflect a timing impact.We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line now for questions.[Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. -- Hi, good morning. Happy early birthday, Scott. -- Thank you. -- The question on the energy business and sort of a two parter. Obviously, great margin as you're returning the business to growth. But it also looked like costs didn't grow, and that was a sharp slowdown relative to the pace throughout 2018. So was there anything going on, or is that sustainable? And the sort of part B of that is just can you give us any sense how much you're investing in the newer areas and why we wouldn't see cost growing more quickly as you expand those businesses? Thank you. -- Well, this is Scott. Let me just give you a general characterization. then Lee, maybe you want to, or excuse me, Neal, maybe you want to jump in with any particular comments. But the way that we are operating in that business, it's a very balanced agenda where we are actually investing a lot in the categories that we talked about before, where you've got Lens, you've got subsurface, chemicals, power and renewables.But then where the rest of the business is concerned, there's been a lot of discipline. And so this is back into, say, the core of the research activities that we do. And you can just see that in the way that the operation is actually moving forward. So no, it's an investment-minded agenda, but we're being selective about where we're spending.Neal, I wonder if you want to add anything to that. -- No. Certainly, Scott. Also on the Lens side, the big focus of Lens is also to drive internal efficiencies, and we're really pleased to see that margin expansion as we roll out Lens. -- Thank you.Your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. -- Yes, thank you, good morning. Maybe I'll move to another segment on the financial side. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color and maybe help quantify a little bit what the growth of the underlying businesses that are doing well is, and when do you think the EDM piece stops becoming a headwind to the overall growth? -- So, Lee, you want to start with just kind of, at the results level, and then I can provide a little color on the context? -- Yes. Sure. So, Manav, thanks for the question. We saw solid growth in the spend-informed analytics and fraud and credit risk management.So we'd described that as north of 10% year-over-year growth in that. The portfolio management was in the mid-single digits range. That obviously is kind of the core of the business. And with regard to enterprise data management, that is where we had a year-over-year decline, but recognizing that, that reflects some of the implementation revenue in the first quarter.So that effect is concentrated within that sector. And it also continues to reflect across that business, the ongoing development and some of the greater choppiness associated with a new and developing business segment. -- Yes. And all I would add to that is that's one of those parts of the business where we've given real attention to try to smooth out some of the cycle that can exist there. But it is inherently a little bit lumpier just because it's moment in time really helping our customers improve their data analytic environment.Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. -- Good morning, thank you. I was hoping if you could sort of just quantify or give us a sense of how much elevated investment spend do you have going through your P&L and CAPEX? So you talked about cloud migration, we talked about Geomni. Just trying to gauge longer term how should we think about a step change in your free cash flow when this elevated investment spend sort of comes down to a more normalized level? Is there a way to think about that at a high level? -- So, Hamzah, thanks for the question. I think there is a way to think about it, and it revolves around CAPEX. And so a lot of our investment takes the form in of internally developed software. And so that's captured in CAPEX.And as we had discussed previously, a lot of the acceleration was associated with the ramp up of Geomni and the purchase of planes and sensors to build scale in that business. And while we continue to invest in that business, it is at a lower level proportionally relative to revenues than it had been in the past. And hopefully, as you saw in this quarter, the capital intensity, in other words, the CAPEX as a percentage of revenue, showed a decline relative to that level. And you saw in terms of the absolute growth rate a slower level of growth.And so I think that is one way to think about the level of capital intensity within the business. Beyond that, we have OPEX expenses associated with a number of our breakout initiatives, and we expect that to continue to grow as we fund these new breakout initiatives across the business. Some of them are profitable, some of them are at an earlier stage where they may be lower margin or not profitable yet. But across the board, we would expect that investment to continue to expand at a reasonable pace and scale it against our overall operating margin expansion that we seek to achieve.Your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. -- Toni, are you there? -- Can you hear me? -- Yes. -- OK, sorry. Energy and specialized saw the highest organic growth rate in three years. And Neal, you talked about how you see stronger growth in the coming five years. The data source that I use for industry CAPEX trends has been revising down sort of growth rates in the next couple of years.So I wanted to sort of get a sense of, if you have any color on how you're thinking about, are you outperforming the market because of the products that you're providing? Is your pipeline strong because of your sales process or products? I guess just what's the disparity between maybe some of the data sources and what you're seeing. Thank you. -- Neal, do you want to take that? -- Yes, no, absolutely, Scott. I think first of all, we see modest growth on investment of our key customers over the next five years, Toni. As I mentioned in the introduction, folks are now starting to look more at investment rather than being prudent on the cost side, which is a great operating environment for Wood Mackenzie. And as you know, the traditional strengths of Wood Mackenzie is the credibility with the market, our unique data sets.And then we are adding to that in terms of a really intuitive data analytic platform in Lens. And as I mentioned in the introduction, the launch of that in the fall of last year, we already have 29 paying customers and we continue to see that growth going over the medium term. -- Hey, Neal, just a thought or really a question for you at the contextual level, is there also some effect in the lower 48? Maybe it's not so much about CAPEX intensity as it is about kind of operating agility and the ability to rebalance your operations very quickly in the unconventionals. I wonder if there's just a little bit of a mix shift there also. Toni is looking at macro data sources. Maybe a little bit of the rebalance toward lower 48.Maybe that's in the CAPEX number a little bit also? -- Yes. No, absolutely, Scott. Toni, I was referring to global CAPEX. Scott is absolutely right.What we're starting to see is a little bit more discipline coming into the operators playing in the lower 48.Your next question is from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. -- Hi, thanks. Just wanted to ask on the insurance side maybe. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the claims side of the business? I noticed, I guess, given the tough comp, it seems like Xactware still grew even despite the comparison. So can you talk a little bit about what's driving the growth there? And I think this is one of the first times you, at least in the presentation, you've highlighted remote aerial or kind of remote imagery solutions.So have you seen a noticeable kind of pickup in adoption of that among the client base? -- Mark, do you want to take that one? -- Sure. So I think you've captured many of the themes. So first of all, I will let you know that across all of the businesses, that would be the Xactware business, which the repair cost estimate continues to be very robust and strong, there was a little bit of storm-related revenue back in 1Q of '18. So we kind of grew over that.Our ClaimSearch or claims analytics business continues to be very well penetrated, but very nicely growing. We continue to add new customers outside of insurance, as well as some of the analytic solutions. We signed a lot of very large contracts last year, which spurred growth. So those are onboard this year, and we continue to do well with those customers.And thirdly, inside that category, Geomni is clearly a contributor to growth from an organic perspective, and we continue to do well in taking customers and expanding the breadth of Geomni in the aerial imagery. So strength across the board.Your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. -- Yes, thank you. Good morning. So as I think about Lens or I guess previously Wood Mac 2.0 and what was talked about at the time of the acquisition originally, I think part of it, and I think you were referencing this, Neal, was related to the way that data is aggregated and automating that process. So I guess where are you in that journey? Have you largely automated the data aggregation process from the large energy companies that are supplying you with data? And then related to that, are there new fields of data, additional data that you're getting now that the process is aggregated, or is automated? Thank you. -- Neal, your favorite topic. Have a go. -- Thank you, Scott. Absolutely, a big win this year in terms of margin expansion was that automation that you referred to. We began the rollout of Lens, which is a true end-to-end process of reimagining which data sets we want to secure, how we automate the capture and the transformation of that data and then for our analysts in turn to add their interpretation and produce the products for clients. We started in onshore U.S.lower 48, exploration and production, and we're currently in the process of rolling that out to the global upstream this year. And your second part of the question, we're always looking for new data sets. But the wonderful thing about this automation and bringing on a new Chief Data Officer Nabeel Azar, is he is tirelessly looking for new data sets, be them in the public domain, be them through partnerships or indeed, other routes.Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. -- Hi, it's Andrew. Lee, Verisk [Inaudible] reported margin expansion in the first quarter, and obviously you're still investing in key growth initiatives [Inaudible] higher levels of investment spending was accomplished in 2018. Lee, with that in mind, is Verisk placed to have reported margins to be up directionally this year? -- So, Andrew, I appreciate the question. Again, looking for guidance on margin. We are striving every quarter to increase our revenues at a higher rate than EBITDA. We achieved that this quarter despite investments, and we'll continue to work to deliver on that.I think, certainly as we said, the growth in this quarter was impacted by some tougher year-over-year comparisons, which I think diminish over time. And so that certainly creates an opportunity for us to show some improvement ahead if we're successful there. -- Thank you.Your next question is from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. -- Hi, thanks. Good morning. The underwriting in ratings revenue piece of insurance business grew 6.8% in the quarter, which was slightly slower than claims revenue growth. And this is pretty typical.Underwriting typically grows at a slower rate than claims. Can you discuss internal initiatives that maybe accelerate the pace of growth for underwriting to the point where it could potentially surpass the claims growth? -- Mark, you want to take that one? -- Sure. So I first need to highlight what we will refer to as our business focused on the pricing and underwriting, and its the forms and coverage. That's it, a business that is kind of the foundation of Verisk for many, many years. It provides a very, very solid base.But at the same time, we're well penetrated, and it's difficult for that business to grow all that dramatically. So what we've been trying to do is grow around that, and we have added many new products and tried to go international to accelerate that growth. And in those areas, we are seeing very high double-digit growth to accelerate the overall growth of underwriting and rating. So we're pleased with the investment that's being made.We're very pleased with the progress that's happening. But to answer your question, international is kind of one way we're going to try to extend and expand. Analytics beyond those core solutions, very important. And as I described, inside this category in the quarter, cat bonds and the cat bond market was a little slow.But nonetheless, our catastrophe modeling continues to, on a baseline, grow nicely with some of those efforts. So I hope I provided you with a little bit of the portfolio and how we think about it to answer your question.Your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. -- Hi, this is Drew Kootman on for Joe. You guys mentioned that the integration, you guys have been having a lot of success on recent acquisitions. I was hoping you could highlight just a couple of those and discuss the pipeline you're seeing moving forward. -- So Neal talked about some of the ways that we've been able to get the cost intelligence side of the business and the supply side and demand side of the business all synchronized in the marketplace. So that's kind of the view on the energy front. And we also talked about how we pulled together LCI and Argus data sets in order to work on some of the more fraud and bankruptcy-related topics that you got in financial services. Mark, do you want to talk a little bit more about sort of the trifecta of SQL, AIR and Analyze Re? -- Yes. I mean, I referenced it kind of in a high level. From an international perspective, I think we've found some very nice opportunities in the U.K., specifically in the London market. We are seeing customers who kind of see the vision, like the ability to consume our analytic and data in a way they see most comfortable but know that we are behind the scenes seamlessly integrating it, which has created an opportunity to walk into a customer, talk about a suite of solutions and them coming to us and saying, geez, don't you also have this product? Wouldn't that fit in? And in a surprisingly and very good way, contracts and opportunities are growing.And I give a lot of credit to the team in the U.K. in how all of our business have really thought about a way to satisfy our customers. That has been reassuring, and it continues to show a lot of promise. -- And, Mark, we said it, but just adding on to this. The SQL tools, which relate to understanding exposures and their accumulations, that has sold almost exclusively in Europe today. Yet, the integration that you're talking about ties it in with AIR, where a very strong part of our AIR franchise is in the United States. So there's a real pull together there. -- The opportunity is not just the U.K. That's what we're thinking. -- Thank you.Your next question is from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust. -- Hey guys, good morning. -- Good morning. -- So my question is on Lens. I was wondering, what's the go to market for that product? Has the focus been on cross-selling to existing customers? And then can you give some color into what aspects of the product customers have been most excited about? -- Neal, you want to take that one? -- Yes. No, absolutely. And it's a dual track. We're really excited about Lens, both in terms of cross-selling into our existing customer base.And also, we've had huge interest from new clients, new logos to Wood Mackenzie. So it's certainly been both. And the feedback that we've got from Lens, and it ranges very much customer by customer, some really love the user experience, how intuitive it is, that they can use it on their laptop, iPhone, iPad. Other folks love the dynamic nature of it.So we have put in various assumptions with our unique data sets. And if they want to change them, they can change that on the fly and recalculate valuations, which would have taken minutes before in a matter of seconds. And then other folks really value that true integrated approach along the value chain, which we will continue to build and build and build over time. -- Neal, maybe you comment also on just kind of the, it's the same sales force that is taking Lens out to the same customers. That is already taking all of our other solutions out to market. -- Yes. No, absolutely. This is just one other avenue for our sales force in terms of how they can support and service our customers. -- The point being that there's leverage here. -- Got that, thank you.[Operator instructions] Your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities. -- So I wanted to ask about the two motion partnership. Basically, how does having a smartphone telematics platform impact your product capability? And does it let you expand your addressable market? Can you go after segments that you couldn't go after before? -- Mark, that's something-- -- Sure. So let me try to-- so reminding you, what we have done is we've partnered with a lot of the OEMs. Honda, Hyundai, GM. And from the vehicle, we've harvested data.We're up to 5 million cars, 90 billion miles, and that is helping our insurers do either modeling themselves or use our programs to understand behavior of those drivers so they can get a better price with regard to insurance. There's also some insurance claims use cases where we can help get assistance and actually initiate a claim. What we're trying to do is provide this consortium of all data available around the vehicle to help our customers understand the risk and price it better. So what the mobile devices do is they can provide that same type of information with, by the way, consent from users so that we have information about distance traveled, information about the quality of the driving, all of that about both the vehicle connected to the driver.In some cases, in deidentified ways. In other cases, we know the vehicle. So it is a part of a broader strategy to aggregate as much information about a vehicle and about a driver to help the assessment of that risk. So hopefully you can understand the expansive nature of what can be involved with telematics from the standpoint of the mobile phone, as well as telematics from the vehicle itself, harvesting from OnStar, as an example. -- Thank you very much.There are no further questions. -- OK. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. We appreciate the continued interest and support. And as you know, we'll be following up with a number of you.So have a great rest of the day. -- Thank you. -- Thank you all. -- Thank you.[Operator signoff] -- I think we set a speed record. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 19th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new July 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.75.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $133.25 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $140.21/share today.

Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 74%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.30% return on the cash commitment, or 9.28% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.80.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $140.21/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $145.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.70% if the stock gets called away at the July 19th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $145.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 22%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 18%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $140.21) to be 18%.

 month has gone by since the las  report for Verisk Analytics (VRSK). Shares have added about 4.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verisk due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Verisk Analytics'  fourth-quarter 2018 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues beat the same.Adjusted EPS of $1.04 missed the consensus estimate by 2 cents and declined 21.8% on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly revenues of $613.9 million beat the consensus mark by $4 million and improved 7.7% year over year on a reported basis. The figure improved 5.4% year over year on an organic constant-currency (cc) basis.Insurance segment revenues totaled $436.2 million, up 8% year over year on a reported basis and 5% at organic cc.In the segment, underwriting and rating revenues of $289.9 million rose 7.4% on a reported basis and 6.9% at organic cc. The improvement was primarily driven by strength in the company's catastrophe modeling services and underwriting solutions. Claims revenues amounted to $146.3 million, which improved 8% on a reported basis and 5% at organic cc. The uptick can be attributed to revenues from repair cost estimating solutions and claims analytics.As energy business' end market continues to improve, Energy and Specialized Markets segment revenues amounted to $130.2 million and improved 11.7% on a reported basis and 4.1% at organic cc. The improvement can also be attributed to revenues from environmental health and safety services, weather and climate analytics businesses as well as growth in consulting and research businesses.Financial Services segment revenues totaled $47.5 million, which slipped 1.8% on a reported basis and 2.8% at organic cc. The downside was primarily caused by headwinds from tough comparisons with prior-year implementation revenues as well as some timing differences.Adjusted EBITDA of $289.1 million increased 6.1% on a reported basis and 4.2% at organic cc. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.8% compared with 48.4% in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA expenses (cost of revenues; selling, general and administrative expenses; investment income and others) increased 9.1% on a reported basis and 6.4% at organic cc. The upside can be attributed to increased salaries and benefits associated with innovation and business growth of remote imagery business.Operating income in the fourth quarter was $216.2 million compared with $210.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating margin was 35.2% compared with 36.8% in the year-ago quarter.Verisk exited fourth-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $139.5 million compared with $147.6 million in the prior quarter.

ne of the most exciting innovations in energy over the past decade has been the development of energy storage technology. Batteries have become viable for almost every size project, from homes to the largest utilities. In 2018, 311 megawatts (MW) and 777 megawatt-hours (MW-hr) of energy storage were installed in the U.S., according to Wood Mackenzie and the Energy Storage Association's. The cumulative installations could power 75,000 homes for an entire year, and they're just the start of the industry's growth. Image source: Getty Images.777 MW-hr of energy storage is a lot, but it'll soon be dwarfed by a few projects. Earlier this month, the Gemini Solar Project in Nevada revealed plans to build a 531 MW/2,125 MW energy storage facility to accompany a 690 MW solar power plant. The project could then smooth out the , when solar intensity falls but electricity demand jumps. In Florida, 's  utility Florida Power & Light is planning a 409 MW/900 MW-hr facility that will be co-located with a solar power plant. In Hawaii, six projects were recently approved by regulators totaling 247 MW/998 MW-hr of energy storage. They will be paired with 247 MW of solar power plants, all of which will deliver electricity to the grid at $0.10 per kWh, or less, which is lower than the cost of fossil fuels on the island. Solar and energy storage have disrupted Hawaiian utility company    but Hawaiian Electric is (slowly) learning to use solar and energy storage assets to its advantage rather than fight renewable energy under its jurisdiction. It's no coincidence that energy storage is booming in scale right now. There's a need in the market to curb the volatility of wind and solar energy production, and battery costs have now come down far enough that energy storage with batteries is economical. It's not just large energy storage projects that are gaining traction. Storage is being attached to residential and commercial solar projects in growing numbers.   says that . On the residential side,  ,  , and SunPower are all offering energy storage for homeowners. The numbers are small, with only 15,000 home storage systems installed in 2018, but they're growing in market share and could be included in . Energy storage is still a small market, but it's growing quickly and costs are coming down just as fast. Lazard's Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis reports that between 2015 and 2018 the average cost of lithium-ion battery storage for utilities fell from $543 per MW-hr to $251 per MW-hr. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie analysts are expecting installations to surpass 4,500 MW in capacity by 2024. If we assume an average cost of $300 per MW, that's a $1.35 billion market for battery makers to sell and developers to add to their portfolios. The market isn't growing by accident, either. The arbitrage between when wind and solar power is provided and demand is highest is growing, creating an economic opportunity for energy storage. Regulators have also opened storage up to competitive markets like PJM, allowing them to bid into the market just like any other power plant. As the cost of batteries and other energy storage mediums fall and the energy markets open up to storage, investors should expect the industry to grow. That's welcome news for everyone from solar developers who are adding storage to projects to utilities who are using storage as a new regulated asset on the grid. And it's an asset class energy investors shouldn't ignore. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and SunPower wasn't one of them!

 is currently benefiting from strong organic revenue growth and acquisitions. The stock has gained 16.8% year to date, underperforming the 13.6% rally of the  it belongs to.With an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 10.2% and a market cap of $20.8 billion, Verisk seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio for now.Verisk Analytics provides predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect, interpret and analyze different types of data sets in real time and at scale.

The company continuously seeks to expand portfolio by leveraging deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new, proprietary data sets and predictive analytics by working with customers to understand their evolving needs. | Acquisitions have also been a growth catalyst for Verisk. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. In 2018, the company acquired four companies - Rulebook, Validus-IVC, Business Insight and Marketview. While Rulebook strengthens Verisk's position in the global insurance market, Validus helps to improve and automate the claims settlement process. The other two acquisitions help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.In spite of significant growth prospects, Verisk is not free from headwinds. It has a debt-laden balance sheet that may limit future expansion and worsen the risk profile. As of Dec 31, 2018, long-term debt was $2.05 billion, while cash and cash equivalents were $139.5 million.Moreover, as Verisk's business model centers on a huge amount of data, the company remains susceptible to security breaches.

For a full detailed analysis using NASDAQ's Guru Analysis tool, Since its inception, Validea's strategy based on John Neff has returned 135.90% vs. 155.57% for the S&P 500. For more details on this strategy,  : While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as ""relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative."" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund. : Validea is an  service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the April 18th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new April 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of 25 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $134.75 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $136.40/share today.

Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 67%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.19% return on the cash commitment, or 11.27% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $136.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.68% if the stock gets called away at the April 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 85%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.04% boost of extra return to the investor, or 2.23% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 21%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 20%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $136.40) to be 19%.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Nike (NKE), 3M (MMM) and Vertex (VRTX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see Buy-ranked  's shares have gained +26.5% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which gained +19.9% over the same period, driven by a strong earnings trend stemming from the solid execution of Consumer Direct Offense. Nike has delivered positive earnings surprise for over three years now, with second-quarter fiscal 2019 marking 26th straight quarter o  beat.Moreover, sales topped estimates for the seventh straight quarter. The Zacks analyst thinks strong progress on Consumer Direct Offense through innovation and focus on direct-to-customer are the key drivers. Growth at international and Nike Direct businesses alongside momentum in North America also aided fiscal second quarter results.Continued strength in Nike Digital is driving the top line. However, higher SG&A expenses due to increased demand creation expense and operating overheads are likely to remain a drag. Further, the unfavorable currency environment due to the global trade and geopolitical dynamics is likely to weigh on the company's sales.(You can  ).Shares of  have lost +5% in the past three months, underperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry, which has gained +8.7% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks 3M stands to gain from efforts to innovate products, solid demand and portfolio restructuring moves. Its acquisition of the technology business of M*Modal is likely to strengthen the Health Information Systems business in the months ahead.In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company's earnings and revenues surpassed estimates. However, on a year-over-year basis, net sales declined 0.6% due to the impact of divestiture and forex woes.For 2019, the company lowered its earnings projection and net sales growth guidance. Foreign currency translation is predicted to adversely influence sales by 1%. In addition, inflation in prices of major inputs and rising competitive pressures pose threats to near-term profitability. Shares also look comparatively overvalued.(You can  ). 's shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past year (+19.2% vs. -15.9%). Vertex beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter. The Zacks analyst likes Vertex's dominance in the CF market. A significant increase in the eligible patient population for its CF drugs is driving sales growth.Vertex's third CF medicine, Symdeko, in a very short time, became the primary driver of the significant growth in CF revenues in 2018. Vertex's CF pipeline is also accelerating rapidly. Studies on Vertex's triple combination CF regimens are moving fast. The CF triple-pill regimes are crucial for long-term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients.Meanwhile, Vertex's non-CF pipeline, though early stage, looks interesting. However, competitive pressure is rising in the CF market with many other companies developing triple combo CF drugs. Also, Vertex's dependence on just the CF franchise for growth is a concern.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include PepsiCo (PEP), Genuine Parts (GPC) and Verisk (VRSK).Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

From 2000 - 2018, while the S&P averaged +4.8% per year, our top strategies averaged up to +56.2% per year.Mark VickerySenior EditorPer the Zacks analyst, Verisk continues to benefit from organic growth and acquisitions. However, high debt may limit its future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Per the Zacks analyst, CBS benefits from an increasing demand for content, rise in retransmission rates and expansion of direct-to-consumer business.The Zacks analyst believes Diamondback's twin buys of Energen Corp and Ajax Resources should bolster its Permian hold. However, the region's lack of takeaway capacity is a concern.Per the Zacks analyst, rise in loans and deposits are likely to aid SVB Financial's revenues further. Yet, elevated costs and high debt level remain drags.Per the Zacks analyst, industrial & automotive acquisitions are helping Genuine Parts boost its products and expand. Also, its value-added services for existing and new customers are paying off.Per the Zacks analyst, Torchmark is set to grow on improving premiums driven by life and health sales growth in distribution channels.The Zacks analyst agrees that Diamond's rig award for Ocean Onyx will help the offshore contract driller fetch significant cash flow.Per the Zacks analyst, Moelis & Company's geographical expansion efforts, continuing solid mergers and acquisitions along with restructuring efforts across the world will likely aid revenue growth.Yelp is gaining from its alliance with Grubhub by providing access to a significant number of restaurants on the platform. Also, growth in paid advertiser account is a tailwind, per the Zacks analyst.Dollar General boasts impressive comparable sales run. Per the Zacks analyst, the company's better price management, merchandise, cost containment and operational initiatives should drive sales.Per the Zacks analyst, PepsiCo's significant international presence exposes it to currency headwinds. PepsiCo expects currency woes to hurt both revenues and EPS by 2 percentage points in 2019.Per the Zacks analyst, higher sales & marketing plus research & development expenses are draining LogMein's margins. Intense rivalry from Adobe Connect, Google and Microsoft Skype is another concern.Per the Zacks analyst, increased marketing investments, along with rising material and transportation costs are pressing concerns for Louisiana-Pacific.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Its acquisition of the technology business of M*Modal is likely to strengthen the Health Information Systems business in the months ahead.In the fourth quarter of 2018, the company's earnings and revenues surpassed estimates. However, on a year-over-year basis, net sales declined 0.6% due to the impact of divestiture and forex woes.For 2019, the company lowered its earnings projection and net sales growth guidance. Foreign currency translation is predicted to adversely influence sales by 1%. In addition, inflation in prices of major inputs and rising competitive pressures pose threats to near-term profitability. Shares also look comparatively overvalued.(You can  ). 's shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past year (+19.2% vs. -15.9%). Vertex beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter. The Zacks analyst likes Vertex's dominance in the CF market. A significant increase in the eligible patient population for its CF drugs is driving sales growth.Vertex's third CF medicine, Symdeko, in a very short time, became the primary driver of the significant growth in CF revenues in 2018. Vertex's CF pipeline is also accelerating rapidly. Studies on Vertex's triple combination CF regimens are moving fast. The CF triple-pill regimes are crucial for long-term growth as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients.Meanwhile, Vertex's non-CF pipeline, though early stage, looks interesting. However, competitive pressure is rising in the CF market with many other companies developing triple combo CF drugs. Also, Vertex's dependence on just the CF franchise for growth is a concern.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include PepsiCo and Verisk.Would you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: VRSK)Q4 2018 Feb. 20, 2019 , Good day and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Result's Conference Call. This call is being recorded.At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk, Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead. -- Thank you,Grace, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Lee highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today, Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.Now, I will turn the call over to Scott. -- Thank you, Stacey and good morning everyone. Apologies for my voice today. As we turn the page on 2018, I want to give you my bottom line view of the year just passed. We did well and see opportunity to improve. The singlemost important reflection of our vitality, is our rate of organic revenue growth and normalizing for the effects of exceptional storm-related revenues and a significant contract signing in Financial Services in 2017. Our organic constant currency revenue growth was 7.2%, ahead of our long-term financial target of 7%. Moreover, our growth was broadly based across our Insurance vertical, along with Wood Mackenzie in the Energy space and our core consortium, data analytics in the Financial Services vertical. The heart of our position in the three verticals is sound and forms the basis for cross-selling new solutions in the future.Looking more deeply into the organic revenue outcomes across the company, I see eight contributing factors. Number one, very high rates of customer retention; two, growth in the number of products consumed by existing customers; three, the introduction and adoption of new innovative solutions; four, positive pricing due to enhanced value in many solutions; five, in those places where we have head-to-head competition, share gains in most categories, including cat modeling, remote imagery, and underwriting decision support; six, affected progress in non-domestic markets, especially the UK; seven, a high rate of capture business with new entrants in the Insurance vertical, including the insure tech companies; and eight, our position as a partner to our customers, who continue to trust Verisk with their data, enabling us to build new solutions in new categories.For example, in Insurance we are working with our customers to repurpose some contributory policy data already used in our underwriting business to develop innovative claims solutions. One such solution will enable carriers to automate the subrogation process quickly and seamlessly. In Energy and Specialized Markets Wood Mackenzie is leveraging the consortium model developed by our Insurance colleagues and bringing it to the energy sector, where we believe it is in a nascent stage.We are currently finalizing an agreement to create an energy data consortium, in one of the key US tight oil plays, and in Financial Services, we are working with our card issuer partners in Mexico to launch a fraud consortium to help combat the transaction based fraud plaguing their system.An important underlying foundation to our growth is the agility of our technical infrastructure, which permits us to bring new solutions to market faster and with greater analytic content. On this front I was pleased with the following in 2018; our analytics community has grown substantially, through our own program of cultivating data scientists, along with industry hiring, and all of this, supported by the naming of our new Chief Analytics Officer. We saw a doubling of our consumption of public cloud capacity in 2018. We have made progress in advancing our data methods to support widespread tokenization, which contributes to our internal security and presents opportunities to access new datasets from equally security-minded data sources.On the innovation front, we introduced a wide variety of unique and customer-driven solutions across our verticals. In Insurance, we launched programs to address new risk exposure, including cyber and flood. We also successfully introduced a variety of disruptive and award winning innovations to the market, which Mark will talk to you about in more detail.In the Energy and Specialized Market segment, we launched Lens, a cloud-based data and analytics platform, which allows customers to access, analyze, and model data in every major commodity in every market and in our Financial Services sector, we delivered next generation merchant analytics to retailers.As a complement to our innovation agenda, we are very focused on driving operational efficiency. As we shared with you in detail at our Investor Day in December, we worked diligently to advance our operational excellence initiative through Lean Six Sigma. With 3,100 employees trained and 85 active projects under way and more soon to be launched, Verisk is driving a culture of continuous improvement, by measurably improving processes and meeting the critical customer needs of quality and speed.Another leading indicator for me comes from the many conversations I have with the CEOs of our leading customers. Are they thinking of Verisk as a partner? Or as a vendor? A consistent message across 2018, is that we are engaging our customers around some of their highest priority initiatives for the future and they see Verisk as a distinctive and trusted partner in doing so. The result of many of my CEO visits is a request that their teams to be placed in closer proximity to our innovation pipeline.A last comment about the year just passed, regards the planning cycle we went through at the end of the year. I have never seen a higher volume of fresh ideas for new solutions and approaches for engaging our customers. We have the wonderful problem of needing to choose among a wide variety of opportunities.Finally, I'm pleased to announce, as you've seen, that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a cash dividend to shareholders. This represents an important milestone in what is the 10th year of our history as a public company, and demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to drive sustainable profitable growth, generate significant free cash flow, and create long-term shareholder value through careful capital management.I will now turn the call over to Mark to comment specifically on our Insurance business. -- Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you, that 2018 was a strong year in our Insurance businesses. One marked by solid growth across most of our lines of business, fueled by leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement. Excluding the impact of approximately $16 million of storm related revenue in 2017, Insurance revenue, on an organic constant currency basis grew 8.3% in 2018. Our customer retention rates remain very high, and the overall portfolio of new and truly innovative solutions is more robust than ever.As Scott mentioned earlier, we received numerous innovation of the Year Awards for our creative solutions, including one, LightSpeed Auto, our innovative data forward workflow solution, that delivers a faster and more efficient experience for underwriting and buying Insurance. A fully bindable online auto quote is delivered after providing only three pieces of key data. We've extended the LightSpeed technology and platform for the rest of the property and small commercial Insurance segments. Several customers have signed contracts and our pipeline of interest for LightSpeed is growing.Two, Verisk Data Exchange. Our IoT data consortium that collects connected car data from our GM, Honda and Hyundai partnerships, on more than 4.7 million vehicles, covering more than 80 billion miles. The Insurance applications range from driving behavioral scores for underwriting to instant notice of loss, solutions for claims. And three, EPIX, our Energy and Power Intelligence Exchange, our Insurance platform that helps energy Insurance professionals research, assess and underwrite complex risks. This solution addresses a critical (inaudible) growth need by combining Verisk's risk scoring and benchmarking Insurance expertise, with WoodMac's unique energy data.A steady stream of first-to-market innovation is one of the four distinctives at Verisk and is also a key driver of our growth. It is also an important force of change within the Insurance industry. On that front, InsurTech is gathering lots of mind share and meaningful capital investment, which we think creates future growth opportunities for Verisk.In my view, InsurTech is growing in two distinct areas. One, start-up insurers and Managing General Agents or MGAs, who are underwriting and distributing Insurance. These type of insured tech start-ups are likely to need data analytics to effectively price and sell Insurance in a competitive market. We believe these start-ups have the potential to become Verisk customers, and in fact in 2018, we engaged with 67 of these start-ups on the 182 opportunities and had 79 product wins.Second, other InsurTech start-ups include service providers, who are trying to improve the Insurance process. These start-ups may be competitors of ours, but many recognize the value of our services and continue to solicit our data analytics, distribution channel or even possible investment. The threat from InsurTech players is igniting investment by more traditional insurers, who are focused on analytics, digital engagement and automation to compete with InsurTech and deliver a better customer experience for their policyholders. This momentum in insure investment have led to increased opportunities for us.A common description of InsurTech is the use of technology innovations, designed to improve the Insurance process by squeezing out savings and driving efficiency from the current Insurance industry model. With this definition in mind, I view Verisk as the most comprehensive and trusted InsurTech provider.As we've communicated to you over the years, international expansion is an important part of our long-term growth strategy, and in 2018 it was a solid contributor to growth. The United Kingdom provides a playbook for success in future international expansion. The global Insurance market, specialty -- especially specialty lines, has hubs -- world with London as the key gateway to  s, and an accelerating step on our journey to extend beyond the United States. This vision is becoming a reality in the UK. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions across the entire Insurance value chain, driving data and automation from broker to underwriter to reinsurer and from quote to claim settlement.During the quarter, we acquired Rulebook, industry leading provider of business intelligence and software solutions for the London Insurance market. Rulebook in combination with Sequel, furthers our goal of providing leading solutions to the global Insurance market, including a comprehensive chain of solutions to specialty insurers for mitigating risks and optimizing total cost of operations. Our customers are recognizing the advantages of these integrated solutions, resulting in new contracts and increased sales opportunities.With a successful 2018 behind us, we are focused on 2019 and are actively meeting with employees and customers. To kick-start each year, we held a series of townhall meetings at our major offices to share Verisk's Insurance solutions strategic direction. We also held our Annual Insurance Sales Meeting in Nashville, earlier this month. The first evening of the sales meeting was an award ceremony and a celebration of a strong 2018. The meeting then serves as a form for leadership to communicate our goals for 2019, and for the sales teams to learn about our new innovative solutions. Our 200-person sales team experienced demos from our product experts, and were briefed in our innovation lab, under a cutting edge AI and automation technologies. Several customers joined us and emphasized the importance of our products and thought leadership to their businesses, as well as suggested enhancements to our solutions. The teams left our townhall and sales meetings with a sense of accomplishment, energy and momentum from 2018 and motivated for 2019.With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. -- Thanks Mark. First, I'd like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. The presentation provides background data trends and analysis to support our conversation today.Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis revenue grew 7.7% to $614 million, as a result of an income tax benefit of $89 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to tax reform, net income decreased 28.5% to $146 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.87 for the fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 28.7% compared with the same period in 2017. Equalizing the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to that of the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 5.6% and 6.1% respectively.Let's focus our quarterly discussion on our normalized organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons and non-recurring items, including the impact of the storm related revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. On a normalized organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 6.9% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting strong organic growth across the Insurance and the Energy and Specialized Market segments, offset by weakness in Financial Services. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 47.8% was up from 47.6% on a normalized basis in the prior year period. Please bear in mind that our reported fourth quarter 2017 margin, not adjusted for the storms, includes the benefit of 100% margin on the $8 million in storm-related revenue.For the full year of 2018 normalized for both the storm-related and non-recurring implementation revenues we achieved 7.2% organic constant currency revenue growth and 7.7% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 2018, up from 48.3% in 2017. We achieved these results, while also maintaining substantial investment in our business, and sustaining ongoing recovery in our Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services sectors.Let's now turn to our segment results on a normalized organic constant currency basis. As you can see in the press release, Insurance segment revenue grew 8.5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9.9%, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5%, up from 52.8% in the prior year and inclusive of substantial investments in remote imagery and telematics. Within our underwriting and rating business, we saw solid performance with healthy growth in commercial lines, personal lines and catastrophe modeling services. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance across most of our claims businesses, partially offset by continued softness in our workers' compensation, claim resolution services.Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 5.1% for the quarter, as the Energy industry continues to recover. We experienced growth in both our core research and consulting solutions, as well as strong contribution from our breakout areas, including power and renewables, chemicals and subsurface. We also had positive contributions from environmental health and safety and weather and climate analytics revenues.Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.3% was slightly down from the prior year period of 31.4%, as we continue to invest in WoodMac 2.0 or Lens, as it is branded in the marketplace, and our chemicals subsurface and power renewables breakouts. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently.Financial Services revenue declined 2.2% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 12.8%. Solid growth in portfolio management solutions and spend-informed analytics were offset by headwinds from tough comparisons with prior year implementation revenues, as well as some timing differences.As we articulated previously, we continue to make progress on our initiative to reduce the variability of revenues in this segment, particularly around project based items. As we work through this process, we will continue to see quarterly fluctuations on revenue and growth, higher than our other businesses. That said, we are encouraged by the long-term growth potential in our Financial Services segment, as we set the business on a stronger foundation for future growth.Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter, up 1.6% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions over the last 12 months and our share repurchase program. Total reported debt was $2.7 billion at December 31st, 2018, down from $3 billion at December 31st, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.3 times. We are very pleased to share that on January 30th, Standard & Poor's upgraded Verisk's credit rating to BBB Flat, with a stable outlook from BBB minus with a stable outlook, and assigned a short-term rating of A-2.Our reported effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, this compares to the negative 14.1% we experienced in the prior year quarter, as we recorded a benefit resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with tax reform. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 16.8%, which was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of soon to expire employee stock options, related to our 2009 IPO, that produced a favorable tax impact.For 2019, we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Though there will be likely some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personnel decisions.Adjusted net income was $174 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.04 for the fourth quarter, down 21.8% from the prior year. This decrease reflects the impact of a prior year $89 million tax benefit related to the 2017 tax reform. Equalizing the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to that of the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 5.6% and 6.1% respectively. Further normalizing for the elevated storm revenue in the quarter, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 10% and 10.6% respectively, consistent with our long-term objective for double-digit EPS growth.Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million for the quarter, up 14.5% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $77 million for the quarter, up 9.8% from the prior year period, reflecting continued investments in future growth opportunities, including remote imagery, telematics and Lens, and software development to support and improve new and existing products across the organization. Total capital expenditures for 2018 were $231 million and represented 9.6% of total revenue. As we've said previously, we expect capital expenditures to decline as a percentage of revenues in 2019, and over the long term, and to be within a range of $220 million to $240 million in 2019.As that translates to depreciation and amortization we expect fixed asset, depreciation and amortization to be within a range of $175 million to $185 million in comparison to the $165 million for 2018, and we expect intangible amortization to be approximately $135 million in 2019 in comparison to $131 million in 2018. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability and future M&A activity. Free cash flow was $97 million for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% from the prior year period.This quarter, we returned $156 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 1.3 million shares at a weighted average price of $119.55. At December 31st 2018 we had $428 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $75 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the first quarter of 2019.Of course, the big news on the capital front, was the initiation of a cash dividend of $0.25 per share this quarter. We are very pleased to reach this milestone in our 10th year as a public company, and to deliver another source of value to our investors. This dividend underscores the stability of our business, profitability and cash flow, as well as a diversification of our capital return discipline, balancing share repurchases and dividends. We further expect that the dividend will open new groups of potential shareholders to Verisk.It's important to note that the dividend initiation does not reflect any diminution in our growth prospects or the opportunities to invest our capital. We will continue to have sufficient capital to support our long-term growth objectives, which remain unchanged. We remain excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.Thank you, Mr. Shavel. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning. Scott, you mentioned that you've been meeting with CEOs of your customers, could you just call out what seems maybe on their minds that might be different than last year, or just give us a sense of the most important priorities that they're focused on? -- Yeah. Thanks Toni. Two things immediately come to mind. One is, I would say almost every Insurance company CEO believes and expects that they can find ways to make their company grow faster than their competitors, faster than the industry. And I think that's really significant, because it means that what they are leaning into is improved methodologies. They're not just trying to sort of hunker down and play a cost game, they are looking to grow their businesses and they realize that the world around them really has changed and continues to change because of technology.So I would say that that's really the first and the most important thing that's going on. I would say a second thing that is also pretty obviously true, I would say, especially for the mid and larger companies, is they are really persuaded of the importance of accessing partnerships and supply from outside of their own companies. In other words, they realize that there are ways that their businesses can be benefited by tying in with in with others, and so I see a lot more partnering, I see a lot more venture investing, as they try to get closer to technology, and I just see a lot more outreach to a company like ourselves that is recognized as being sort of distinctively able to help across multiple fronts.So these are very constructive meetings, they are partnership meetings. -- Terrific. And then for my follow-up. I wanted to ask about margins. So in Insurance, I think we've seen investment impacting margins, seen with first quarter in Energy last year, I guess should we view 2019 as maybe a little bit -- a continuation of investing maybe a little bit less so than 2018 or how should we directionally sort of think about it and then outside of scale, are there any margin initiatives across the business like efficiencies that you're looking to drive this year? Thanks -- Thanks Toni. This is -- so I think it's -- I would start off by saying, certainly all our businesses, we think have superb operational --operating leverage. And so, as you know, across the organization, our expectation is that each of the businesses will demonstrate improvement in margin. I think it's a fair observation that in 2018, there was a high level of investment in a variety of initiatives, Geomni, Lens, IoT and telematics, where we chose to make those investments and that -- those obviously had a negative impact on margin.But notwithstanding that, I want to reiterate, as I mentioned in my comments that both -- for the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole, when you normalize for the storm activity, we had margin expansion on the year-over-year periods. And so from our perspective, recognizing that storm revenue and the implementation revenue for TSYS was 100% margin, and so that certainly skewed that year-over-year comparison. We believe that we delivered margin expansion, as well as substantial investment in the businesses for that period.In 2019 we won't have that storm comparison and as Scott indicated, we still see very attractive opportunities to invest. But I think it's fair to say that probably in 2018, from a scale standpoint, particularly around Geomni, it was a higher level, consistent with our CapEx guidance that was an acceleration. We expect to see that absolute level of investment decline as a percentage of revenue. So we feel good about the opportunity to strive toward our goal of margin expansion. -- Thank you. -- Thanks Toni.Our second question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thank you. Just on the Financial Services segment, maybe you could just touch on how you plan to reduce variability of revenues in that vertical, and maybe just timing of that initiative? -- Sure. Hamzah, this is Lee. Thanks for that question. So the process is essentially in recognizing in project related revenues. I think the tendency in the past had been to recognize more of that revenue upfront. I think as we have the flexibility in structuring those relationships as new business comes on, we are -- and this is not perspective, this is already occurring, we are structuring the relationship, so that revenue is realized over time, so that we don't have these large chunks of revenue that create that variability. So that is part of the objective. That's a structural initiative as we work with clients. But also I think fundamentally, as we think about developing the growth of the business, our focus is on building the sustainable growth component off of the four constituent businesses that we've described before. So that it is more incremental growth across that base. I think both of those will contribute to more stable, less variable revenue and profitability over time. -- Great. And just for my follow-up question, on the international business, what sort of next milestones should we be looking at in that business? I know you talked about products essentially needing to be more customized locally. So just any color on long-term international Insurance strategy? Thank you. -- Yes, thank you. This is Mark. Just to kind of follow up on the question. So I think what we've seen is, it's a bit of a build and buy scenario. So what we are now doing, which is become a very powerful in front of customers is, we've taken many of our solutions and we started to integrate them in a more holistic way. So walking into a customer as opposed to buying all these point solutions, there is an attractiveness of knowing that your data is going to flow from the beginning of a process that starts at maybe a quote or an underwriting decision on through the process, so you can see it from a portfolio perspective in some of our catastrophe modeling solutions, and all of that is information that's embodied in the solution at Sequel.The concept and the construct here is, I can do it more effectively, I can do it more efficiently and I can do it more accurately. And on top of that backbone, we've added some of, I will refer to it the ISO and some of the other analytics that has been so powerful here in the States.So that continues to evolve. I think we'll be able to do more and more with customers as we gain access to more data, and maybe just to take your question one step further, to maybe highlight that -- I think we see London as being kind of a gateway into the international community, especially with the specialty lines. So as we win these contracts, we're doing work, not just in the UK, but with companies who are located in UK, but are underwriting business throughout the world. So our next step into other geographies is that much easier. -- Great. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to ask about the Financial Services business, which was really weak for the second year in a row. I'm wondering if this business has the same distinctives that really characterizing both your Insurance and your Energy and Specialized Markets businesses, especially since competition here seems to be increasing with a number of well capitalized competitors like MasterCard offering more and more analytics to a credit card issuer.So my question really is, does this business really still fit within Verisk, especially given the broader capital allocation framework that you've rolled out today, which seems to focus more on capital return? -- David, it's Scott here. Yes, the business does that. The -- I think that many of the folks on the call today are familiar with, what we call our four distinctives, which we talk about a lot, which is just to remind everybody, our unique data assets, deep domain expertise, first mover advantage and deep embedment and customer workflows; and what we do in Financial Services has all four of those qualities. So as Lee previously talked about some of the things that have sort of moved through the business of late, we talked about the sort of the lumpy quality of the way that some of the revenues have been recognized in the past. What I would go back to is, that the heart of the business is built on consortium data, which is absolutely unique and unlike the data, which is available to anyone else, including the players you just mentioned, on top of which then, we have very deep relationships with our customers and really a large data platform, which is really remarkable for a company of that size.So all of the conditions are there and then I would also say, again echoing what Lee said, the strength of portfolio analytics, plus the spend analytics that we do, are the leading parts of the business and they're actually healthy. So we expect that, as these other effects sort of wash through, you'll get sort of a more clear view of those things built upon the distinctives, which really will power the business going forward. -- Thanks for that as a quick follow-up. I'd just like to ask about dividend policy. The math shows that the LTM payout ratio is about 28%. How do you think about the payout ratio that you're using to set the dividend and do you expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings or faster than earnings going forward? -- Thanks David, it's Lee, let me take that. So we -- in setting that level, we looked at the payout ratio, really also what proportion of capital are we allocating to the dividend and an eye on kind of yield and where yields are out there. We recognize that investors will expect and reward growth in the dividend over time, and we certainly believe that our ongoing earnings growth will provide a very strong consideration for these decisions by our Board in the future.We also expect to weigh capital investment and return opportunities in the allocation decisions ahead. So all of those I think factor into it, but there clearly is a recognition that there will be an expectation, given our overall growth that there -- that the dividend should grow as well. And that's what we will balance looking ahead in advises with the Board on these decisions. -- Thank you very much. -- Thanks David.Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Good morning. Scott, I think at the beginning of the call, you talked about the repurposing of 7B Insurance Consortium data, and I was wondering if you can just expand on that, maybe taking a step back and letting us know how much of the data do you have access now to play around and innovate with, and if this is a new or ongoing opportunity? -- So let me start and Mark you may want to amplify some of this. But when we think about data and the Insurance vertical, it's really a combination of looking for opportunities to tease additional meaning out of existing data sets and generating new datasets. So upfront, I mentioned for example, subrogation. Subrogation is essentially bound up in the claims resolution process, and as I think most folks know, we have a lot of claims data. So finding a way to point that at the subrogation case and to think about affiliated things like clearing payment between counterparts, is just interesting and it's really a process that hasn't really been transformed yet in the Insurance industry.So that would be an example of repurposing. But then there are other places where we're trying to generate original datasets. And one thing I would just comment on here is that, on the one hand we are very alert to opportunities to position data to where it can be repurposed. On the other hand, we are very diligent about the the reasons why our customers made the data available to us in the first place. And so we're going to always be striking a balance between the -- what's possible and what our customer contributors would like to see us do. But there's plenty of room in there for innovation. And then there are a variety of new data sets where we're making original calls for data. And you know, actually, even that takes a couple of forms. One is, we have existing platforms like PCS where we started to call data related to cyber incidents, and we didn't used to do that.So that's original data, but around an existing platform. We are always trying to enrich the data that comes into a platform like claims search, and then we're trying to find yet new forms of claims data that we don't receive today, for example, commercial claims histories are not as developed as personal claims histories. Mark, anything you want to add to all that? -- I think that was well said. I think it goes back to the earlier comment I made about partnerships in conversations with CEOs. In the world of data, obviously, our customers and many people feel their data is valuable. So we need to provide them with valuable use cases back to their businesses, in order for them to let us use the data. So having the great partnerships and relationships is very important. We continue to be a trusted intermediary for that data, and we feel that it's a privileged position. -- Got it and just for the follow-up. Lee, Just on the Energy and Specialized side I think last year you guys called out, I think it was a bank and then a merger related kind of headwind to the business. Have we lapped those comps and does that mean next year, your number should start looking better? -- Thank you, Manav. We will lap that in the first quarter of 2019. So we were still experiencing that headwind in the fourth quarter, but that will go away in the first quarter of 2019. -- Next question.Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Hi, it's Andrew/ I wanted to ask about WoodMac 2.0 Lens. What are some milestone and rollouts that we should be looking for, and will WoodMac 2.0 help margins and revenues or just one of them and particularly make a comment for 2019? -- Yeah, so let me take it at a general level. Andrew, maybe Lee, if you want to add anything. It's constructive on both the revenue and the margin side, because part of what Lens is getting after, is the very nature of our data aggregation, and it becomes more efficient on this platform that we've built. But equally, there's more functionality there for customers and so we think it will be constructive in in both ways.I don't -- I wouldn't point you so much to milestones, or at least not those that will be called out in the overall performance of the business. What I'm trying -- and I'm not making a comment about the future profile of the financial performance of the business. I'm simply saying, the revenue streams are all sort of -- think of it as a bowl of spaghetti, and Lens works its way through things that we already do, in addition to representing modules, new modules that we can license to customers. But I've called out specifics. Basically it will be -- we do business with so many companies already, this will really enhance cross-selling into existing relationships. But in terms of visibility to the outside I'm not -- I wouldn't call out any particular milestone, just the general progress of the business certainly. Lee, anything you want to add that? -- No, I think Scott covered it. I would just make the comment that Lens really represents the platform that enables us to continue the evolution of a very good research and consulting business into increasingly a data analytics business that can serve a broader customer base, can develop and integrate data products more effectively, which is beneficial both from a revenue growth standpoint, as well as from a margin perspective. And I would just finally add that the team there continues to work on operational efficiencies, to improve the margin as well. -- But Lee, might there be a time like maybe this year where you're running two infrastructures for WoodMac and it might be a drag to margins ? -- Well, I mean, yes, but no. So you observe something, yes. But the implication, I don't think is right. So yes we need to be running things in parallel and we have been investing, as Lee has referenced several times, to build the platform. But the actual operation of the platform, I mean one of the things that's so constructive inside of our business, is that we enjoy the gift of Moore's Law every day. And so actually, the cost of compiling data or even processing data inside of the platform that you have built, the incremental cost is not really all that great. I'm not saying that it's zero. So you're correct about what we will do operationally. But I think the implication you are trying to reach in terms of operating expense going forward is not so accurate. -- Yes, and I would go more broadly. And I think that definitely has some relevance with regard to our transition to cloud, where we are making investments and see opportunities to find greater efficiencies, where we still have legacy costs. I think that is -- would be a valid observation, not so much in this context. So thank you for the questions. -- Thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. -- Yes hello. First I wanted to ask on the Energy side of the business. In the prepared remarks, you talked about being close designing to signing a consortium deal. Can you talk more about that and the nature of the data, I guess and the product, I guess that would flow out of it? -- Yeah. So those of you who have followed us, know that the majority, in fact, a large majority of the data that we've had up until today, has been mostly about the commercial dimensions of the oil and gas business. So observations about productivity and the cost factors associated with the assets that produce either the raw materials or the refined materials. So those are the datasets, that have typically traditionally been a part of what we do. The datasets we are adding, are what we call the sub-surface datasets, and these are the ones that take into account the actual real-time operations, even in the oilfield, in combination with the nature of the rock and the nature of the fluids and the nature of the fields. So that we can complement everything we've already done -- always done, with basically much more real-time optimization of the operations of our customers' assets. And this is something that we haven't done as much of, in fact very little of, up till now. So the datasets relate to that; real-time operational optimization. -- And did you say it was for specific region or sub-sector of companies you would start with? -- Well you know -- so whenever we talk about the consortium dataset, you're always -- you're always talking about specific customers and generally specific product sets or specific places. So that does apply in what we're doing in building these new datasets, the subsurface data sets, and our focus right now, predominantly is the lower 48 in the United States, where the need -- the situation in the United States is different than the situation in most other parts of the world, because in the United States, what the operators are doing is basically saying, that particular rig should I move it 2,000 feet and I can move it and four days later, have a 1,000 foot well that's producing, and so that's the speed with which 'strategy' is being set and operations are being rebalanced in the United States. -- Okay, great. Thank you. And then just on the Insurance side, the aerial imagery product set, can you -- and I think you mentioned it is one of the growth drivers, I guess, but can you give us more color on adoption kind of competition for that product at this point? How it's scaling, maybe relative to what the initial plan was 18 months ago or 12 months ago when you kind of made a more aggressive push into this space? -- Sure. So this is Mark. I think your question is directed at Insurance and at the same time, we have been extendable (ph) beyond that. So first of all, we've been very pleased with the takeaway we had in the market. Our market share is growing, we've won significant customers and many of them that is clearly contributed to some of the organic growth that we've talked about here. Beyond what is -- I will refer to it as kind of market share, we've also continued to add products. So remember in the world of, what I view as a complete coordinated solution, if I was to take and use imagery in combination with some of the scoping and what we refer to as image to scope, which is the exact imaging tool behind or in-front of all this imagery, we can really automate and become more accurate and more cost effective for those claims adjusters. Literally, we think we can double the productivity of the claims adjuster field forces at our customer, saving them hundreds of millions of dollars. So we're seeing that.What I also like to highlight though, is that growth is extending beyond what is traditional Insurance. As you think about the world of contractors, if you think about the world of -- I will refer to it as mapping and construction, as well as roofing companies, all of those have found use cases in some slimmed down or innovative way we view some of the technology. So that is contributing to the growth across the board, even outside of Insurance. -- All right. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Good morning, everyone. -- Morning. -- So you mentioned the UK as a model and a gateway for international expansion. So culturally, there's a lot of similarities in the US and the UK. I guess, Winston Churchill would call them two nations divided by a common language. But as you go --as you look to prioritize your -- of the geographies for international expansion, what are the ones where you are going to be focusing first? -- So, I am going to assume that is a continuation of the conversation we had on Insurance. So, we think there's a more to do in the UK. So we'll continue to push there. I think what we've identified is, looking at like markets, looking at places that have a more mature Insurance marketplace, and a gross -- it's going to be a gross premium and a growing gross premium. We have really identified Europe, but more specifically Germany and France as kind of the next couple of places that are of interest.Down the road, and I think everyone thinks about kind of emerging markets -- emerging Insurance markets like China, India. We aren't turning a back on that, we are keeping an eye on it. But we kind of think to your point, trying to stay close to the markets that are a little bit more mature in Europe is probably the best next step for us. -- Got it. Then for my follow-up, your thoughts on FX impact to revenue in 2019? -- Yes. So Bill I know -- the reason that we try to focus on organic constant currency numbers is that, we can't can't predict what's going to happen from an FX standpoint. So we're focusing on results, excluding the FX range. I do think generally, given the very strong US orientation of our business, generally, the fact that WoodMac has a mix of US and international revenues, we think overall, the exposure is relatively low. So I'd say proportionally, we don't think it will have a big impact, but our focus is always to try to eliminate that factor, which we can't completely control. -- Got it. Thank you very much.Thank you. We have our next question from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now open. -- Yes, thank you. As you productize the subsurface consortium data as you were just kind of explaining, are you inventing new categories of solutions to sell to customers? And I don't mean new relative to Verisk, I mean, new relative to the market? Or certain another way, do you have to displace solutions from the leading incumbents that have subsurface data already, or are these, I guess greenfield opportunities? -- It's a combination of the two and it really hinges upon how much analytic content we get into what we do. So there are players today and that will provide observations about a number of the sort of individual parameters that apply, when you're trying to understand the productivity of real-time operations. So from one place you can get data that relates to, for example, the completion strategies that have been taken for the individual well. There are other sources where you can make sure that you have completely identified the leasing -- the leaseholding an ownership structure of whatever patch of land you're talking about, and then other places you can go for the heavy seismology work, and on and on and on like that.So part of what we will do is to increasingly make those kinds of those kinds of data available to our customers. But then, over and above that, what doesn't exist so much in the marketplace today is the -- is really the AI machine learned expression of all of that data in quantity across heterogeneous situations. So that in an automated fashion, you can really make predictions and drive decisioning, and there we expect, because we're Verisk, we will be distinguished. How much those kinds of solutions generate completely original revenue streams versus how much they displace, for example, some of these bespoke datasets. I would say that remains to be seen. The primary point here is, there is the opportunity for differentiation. -- That's helpful. And then on the Insurance business, there's been some underlying acceleration and there is a couple of years where maybe it was growing below trend a few years ago and you called out some various moment in time factors at that point. But I guess Scott, as you list out the eight factors that are driving it, they sound largely sustainable. So just how are you thinking about Insurance growth at this point. Like has bookings growth also accelerated, is bookings growth outpacing revenue growth? Thanks. -- Yeah, so, you definitely understood what I was saying upfront. All eight of those trends apply broadly across our company, but specifically in the Insurance vertical. I mean, if you just step back and you say OK, this environment -- this Insurance environment, what characterizes it? The customer set is relatively stable. There are occasionally some large merger transactions, and there are some segments like global reinsurance brokers, where there has been some of that seasonally. But by and large, the customer demography is steady. Regulation really doesn't change that much. Energy -- excuse me, technology is a constructive factor, as it relates to a company like us, because back to the top, every -- virtually every one of our customers believes they can grow faster than their competitors. And so everybody is trying to behave innovatively, and so that's, that's just inherently constructive for folks like us.And then if you think about all of the -- the many references that we've made this morning, they are just new things that we're doing and bringing to the market that don't exist. And so, it's a constructive environment. I mean, the United States Property and Casualty Insurance industry, our home market, is the grand daddy of large-scale contributory data analytics. I mean it was invented that way practically. And so we really have this wonderful privilege of being who we are inside of that very constructive environment. -- Thank you, Jeff. I think we have time for two more questions.Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks, good morning. I'd like to drill deeper into the Financial Services business; you touched on plans to reduce the variability of revenues through the restructuring of contracts. Can you elaborate on the initiatives you have to improve the overall growth of the segment? Because in the quarter, even after normalizing for the year-ago implementation revenues associated with TSYS, organic growth would have been pretty muted, any color there would be helpful? -- Sure. So George, this is Lee, and and I'm going to refer back to the kind of description in the organization that Lisa gave at Investor Day. And so, I think it's helpful if you think about it in the four components. The foundation of this business is the benchmarking solutions business. And as we indicated, the growth in that part of the business remains very stable. In addition, the spend-informed analytics component remains solid. The two areas where in the fourth quarter and I think represent our opportunity to make progress, is in the enterprise data management component, and that really is an emerging space, it is one where we are finding opportunities to develop new data management solutions for our customers. Given our scale, given our expertise, and that's something that we certainly think, based upon feedback from clients is very positive. But that is something that we will develop over time. We're encouraged by the initial responses.And the other element is the fraud component, and that's an area, similarly where we -- I feel very good about the contributions from our acquisition of LCI and G2, we are in the process of developing some of the infrastructure, some of the product sets around that, and we think that over time, that area will also be a stronger contributor to the growth overall.So that would be the way I would kind of organize thinking around where we see or where we have a immediate focus on improving the growth rate for that business. -- Very helpful. As a follow-up. I'd like to switch over to the Energy business, you saw an incremental step down in organic constant currency growth there, can you talk about trends in your non-recurring revenue streams in Energy and how annualized contract value growth is progressing, in light of some of the declines we've seen in  ? -- Sure. So I think in that -- that's principally the consulting -- consulting component business that was -- it was still growing and growing at a higher rate than our subscription business. But the third quarter was particularly strong, and so I think that contributed at one level to a slight -- and I would just view it as kind of a slight slowdown relative to the third quarter level. But overall, I think we see progress in this -- continued progress in the subscription component of the business, particularly as it relates to to the new breakout initiatives that are generating strong subscription growth within that segment. -- I would just add, the recent movement in the commodity is within a range that we don't consider it material to the performance of our business. -- Great, very helpful. Thank you. -- Thanks, George.Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for sneaking me in. I'll be quick. Just a quick numbers questions, Lee, what should we be modeling for interest expense this year, and also the tax rate guidance that you gave us for 2019, is that something we should view as longer term? Thanks. -- Yeah, so on tax, I think based upon what we see right now, obviously, any changes in tax legislation. I think that 19% to 21% range is a good basis. On interest expense, it's not something that we give formal guidance, we -- obviously that's going to flex, based upon what happens within the business and our capital allocation decisions. So, I think kind of starting with the point of just stability in overall debt levels and looking at the average rates, is probably a middle of the way road to go. But I wouldn't give you any specific guidance beyond that, because that will adjust based upon our our capital allocation decisions over time, I would expect that we remain within this -- within this leverage range, absent any other material changes. -- Okay. Thanks so much. -- Okay. Well thank you all very much for your continued interest in Verisk, and we look forward to following up with a number of you, as well as those who are taking a new look at Verisk, based upon our new capital policy, including the dividend. So look forward to our continuing conversations with you.

 is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Feb 19, after the bell.While we expect the company's top line to reflect segmental strength, the bottom line is likely to be driven by solid organic growth, 2017 tax reform policy (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and contributions from acquisition.Shares of Verisk have gained 28.3% over the past year, significantly outperforming the 8.2% rally of the  it belongs to and 1.9% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 Composite Index.The top line is expected to benefit from solid growth across all the three segments - Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services.Insurance segment revenues are expected to be driven by strength across its two units - Underwriting & rating and Claims. While strength in the company's catastrophe modeling services and underwriting solutions should boost Underwriting & rating revenues, Claims top line is likely to benefit from repair cost estimating solutions and claims analytics revenues.Improvement in the energy business's end market, and strength in environmental health and safety services as well as consulting and research businesses are likely to drive Energy and Specialized Markets segment. The Financial Services segment is expected to grow on the back of enterprise data management and portfolio management solutions revenues. | Strong organic growth, 2017 tax reform policy (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and contributions from acquisitions are likely to boost the company's bottom line.Please note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

"hen President Trump implemented tariffs on imported solar cells and panels early in 2018, it was intended to drive a manufacturing renaissance in the U.S. and potentially hurt the overseas solar manufacturing industry. But  and solar panel prices are actually lower now than when tariffs were implemented, a strange turn for the industry.As tariffs make a measured decline from 30% now to 15% in 2021, they'll become even less of a headwind. Here's a look at where solar panel prices are today and who may be affected.Image source: Getty Images.The quarterly  put out by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) tracks the per-watt costs of solar cells and panels in the U.S., which reflect the impact of tariffs. The table below shows the change in cell and panel pricing over the past year, and you can see that prices are actually declining, despite tariffs going into place in Q1 2018.
  
Source:  .What drove prices lower had nothing to do with U.S. manufacturing or the tariffs themselves. It was the high demand late in 2017 that led to unusually high panel pricing, and a subsequent drop in demand after tariffs were implemented in the U.S. and  .By mid-2018, the solar industry had entered a new phase of oversupply, and global cell and panel pricing plunged. According to an analysis by the website EnergyTrend, solar panels can be purchased in tariff-free international markets for $0.22 per watt, an incredibly low price for solar products.While demand has picked up for solar panels as prices have fallen, we should expect fourth-quarter earnings and guidance for 2019 to be mixed, depending on a company's manufacturing capacity. (NASDAQ: CSIQ) and China's  (NYSE: JKS) are two of the largest solar manufacturers in the world, and I would expect both to report lower revenue per watt sold, although margins may not be as bad as you might think.The one benefit for some solar manufacturers is that component pricing is down even more than panel prices. You can see above that the spread between cell and panel pricing remained about flat over the past year, and polysilicon and wafer prices (components that go into making solar cells) are down significantly as well. That dynamic could actually help Canadian Solar's and JinkoSolar's margin percentage because both assemble more solar panels than the number of cells they produce.U.S. manufacturer  (NASDAQ: FSLR) , which benefited from tariffs because it was never subject to them, has reported weaker-than-expected guidance for 2019 because it's seeing lower panel pricing. It doesn't have the same component benefit as Canadian Solar or JinkoSolar may have because it manufactures the full solar panel. Ironically, it has been hurt more than most competitors by the supply-and-demand imbalance in 2018, and that will continue this year. (NASDAQ: SPWR) is one company that may see both sides of the pricing dynamic. The U.S. company makes everything from polysilicon to solar panels for some of its high-efficiency solar panels, which could see lower margins as panel pricing pressure hits the market in residential and commercial solar. But in power plants, it's buying commodity cells and assembling them into solar panels known as its P-Series, which could see better margins as component prices decline.As rough as 2018 was for solar companies, low component pricing is helping drive volume demand going into 2019 and beyond. In the U.S., Wood Mackenzie and the SEIA increased their 2020 to 2023 solar-installation guidance by 3.2 GW in the last quarter, due to a rush of utility-scale project signings.

 business, Xactware, yesterday introduced EstimateON, a mobile application that provides repair and improvement cost estimates to real estate professionals.Upon entry of property address and a description of the type of work, the application immediately generates an estimate based on actual labor and material rates associated with similar jobs in the local area.EstimateON seems to be useful in real estate transactions as an immediate estimate of repair or remodeling cost can be factored into deals in real time. This will speed up negotiations and help close more deals.The application uses Xactware's comprehensive pricing data that includes localized, independently researched cost information for more than 10,000 material, labor, and equipment items.We observe that shares of Verisk have rallied 14.9% in the past year, against the 1% decline of the  it belongs to.We believe that the new offering will boost Verisk's insurance segment that provides repair cost estimating solutions. Performance in the segment was particularly strong in the las  ed quarter with revenues of $427.7 million, up 8% year over year on a reported basis and 5.5% at organic constant currency (cc).In the segment, claims revenues of $142.6 million rose 6.3% on a reported basis and 4% at organic cc.Currently, Verisk carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader  sector are Republic Services  , Waste Connections  and Navigant Consulting  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Republic Services, Waste Connections and Navigant is 10.7%, 11.7% and 13.5%, respectively.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $121.83, changing hands for $121.98/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $140.00. The standard deviation is $13.134.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $121.83/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $121.83 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:

 looks strong on the back of its predictive data analytics portfolio. The company continues to grow with the help of acquisitions and organic growth.The company's fourth-quarter 2018 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues beat the same. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share missed the consensus estimate by 2 cents and declined 21.8% on a year-over-year basis. Quarterly revenues of $613.9 million beat the consensus mark by $4 million and improved 7.7% year over year on a reported basis. The figure improved 5.4% year over year on an organic constant-currency (cc) basis.Verisk has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters. It delivered average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 1.3%.Verisk's expertise in providing predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect and interpret different types of data sets is impressive. The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing to serve customers in areas of rating, underwriting, claims, catastrophe and weather risk, natural resources intelligence and economic forecasting. Its efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying client demands and its technical prowess in analytics and Big Data provide Verisk an edge over its competitors.Higher organic revenue growth through a combination of increase in new customers for existing solutions, cross-sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and the sale of new solutions will help Verisk create long-term value. In 2018, total revenues grew 6.5% organically and 6.1% on an organic constant-currency basis. This marks an improvement from 2017 when total revenues grew 4.5% organically and 5.3% on an organic constant currency basis.Moreover, Verisk continues to earn a major portion of its revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements. In 2018, Verisk's three reportable segments: Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services generated a respective 82%, 78% and 73% of revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements for its solutions.Acquisitions have also been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. In 2018, the company acquired four companies - Rulebook on Dec 14, Validus-IVC Limited on Jun 20, Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5. While Rulebook should solidify Verisk's position in the global insurance market, the buyout of Validus will help improve and automate the claims settlement process. The other two acquisitions will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.Verisk's balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Dec 31, 2018, long-term debt was $2.05 billion while cash and cash equivalents were $139.5 million. Such a cash position implies that Verisk needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Since Verisk's business model centers on huge amount of data, it remains susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches at its facilities, computer networks, and databases, resulting in loss of its credibility and/or customers. Dependence on external sources for data supply can lead to contractual and pricing issues with data suppliers (some of them are also its rivals).Currently, Verisk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Omnicom  , Robert Half  and Automatic Data Processing  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

erisk Analytics (VRSK) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.84 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.93%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurance data provider would post earnings of $1.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of 4.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Verisk, which belongs to the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, posted revenues of $598.70 million for the quarter ended September 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.20%.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Verisk was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future.

all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Verisk Analytics (VRSK) reports results for the quarter ended December 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This insurance data provider is expected to pos  of $1.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +30.9%.Revenues are expected to be $609.26 million, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Verisk, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verisk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Verisk would pos  of $1.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.08, delivering a surprise of +0.93%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verisk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

t has been about a month since the last earnings report for Verisk Analytics (VRSK). Shares have added about 3.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verisk due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Verisk Analytics reported mixed third-quarter 2018 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same.Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.08 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and improved 30.1% on a year-over-year basis. The figure was driven by strong organic growth, 2017 tax reform policy and contributions from acquisitions. However, these were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, interest expenses as well as higher share count.Quarterly revenues of $598.7 million missed the consensus mark by $1.2 million but improved 9% year over year on a reported basis. Also, the figure improved 4.7% year over year on an organic constant-currency (cc) basis, partially offset by costs related to a nonrecurring project in the year-ago quarter as well as adverse weather conditions. segment revenues came in at $427.7 million, up 8% year over year on a reported basis and 5.5% at organic cc.In the segment, underwriting and rating revenues of $285.1 million was up 8.9% on a reported basis and 6.3% at organic cc. The improvement was primarily driven by strength in the company's catastrophe modeling services and underwriting solutions. Claims revenues of $142.6 million improved 6.3% on a reported basis and 4% at organic cc. The uptick can be attributed to revenues from repair cost estimating solutions and claims analytics.As energy business' end market continues to improve,  segment revenues of $127.7 million were up 14.6% on a reported basis and 6.3% at organic cc. The improvement can also be attributed to revenues from environmental health and safety services as well as growth in consulting and research businesses. segment revenues of $43.3 million increased 4% on a reported basis. However, the figure declined 9.2% at organic cc, primarily owing to an impact of approximately $6 million in non-recurring project revenues in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA of $284 million increased 5.4% on a reported basis and 1.6% at organic cc. Organic cc adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% compared with 50% in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted EBITDA expenses (cost of revenues; selling, general and administrative expenses; investment income and others) increased 12.5% on a reported basis and 7.9% at organic cc. The upside was due to increased salaries and benefits associated with innovation and business growth of aerial imagery business.Operating income for the third quarter was $211.1 million, up 1.3% from the prior-year quarter's tally. Operating margin of 35.3% declined 270 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter's figure.Verisk Analytics exited third-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents balance of $147.6 million compared with $132 million in the last reported quarter. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.04 billion, flat sequentially.The company generated $226.8 million of cash from operating activities and spent $55.2 million on Capex. Adjusted free cash flow was $171.6 million.During the quarter, the company repurchased 0.9 million shares for $102 million. It also entered into a $50-million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. The shares repurchased will be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of Sep 30, 2018, the company had $584 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.Currently, Verisk has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Verisk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $123.55, changing hands for $123.88/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $105.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $135.00. The standard deviation is $10.376.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $123.55/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $123.55 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: VRSK)Q3 2018 Oct. 31, 2018 , Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics Third Quarter . All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Brodbar. Ma'am, you may begin. -- Thank you, Regina, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Lee highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor Section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.Now, I will turn the call over to Scott. -- Good morning, everyone. It's good to be reporting another quarter, where we can see strength in organic growth of our business across all our verticals. Excluding exceptional events in the third quarter of 2017 in the Insurance segment due to extreme weather and in the Financial Services segment due to a contract signing. The organic growth of our company was 7.5% in the quarter, consistent with our long-term model. And the profile of our growth is also reflecting our long-term model and that it is balanced across all the verticals.I thought I would take a few minutes this morning to comment on the environment in which we do our work, and the factors which interact with our results. Fundamentally, we are aligned with one of the most powerful movements in the economy, which is, companies harnessing data analytics with even greater focus and investments. There is a new level of digitization of business operations that has become a necessity for companies in all the verticals we serve. While the notion of data's and asset has been around for a while, companies now are compelled to change the way they interact with their customers by becoming faster and more automated, more visual and easier to use. These changes at the front-end of the business model, require companies to rewire almost everything behind the front-end as well. As business has become more digital, they accumulate more data in real time and this causes them to become more analytic, given the decreased cost of ingesting and storing the data combined with improving data science.Against this backdrop, our ability to help our customers on the digitization journey in combination with our unique data sets and deep domain knowledge, give us expanding opportunities to add value for our customers. The search for efficiency and insight from data analytics will only increase for our customers. As long as we remain close to our customers, hearing their emerging needs and responding with timely useful solutions, that leverage our scale across industry participants. Our value to our customers will grow. It is a positive thing for us that our customers are becoming more data analytic and hiring more data scientists. This increases their propensity to the value of the things we do we.We are always alert to three risks. Is the regulatory environment changing, is the structure of the verticals we serve changing and is the environment causing changes in the cost of doing business. On the one hand, the regulatory front have seen some change, but on the other hand, there have been few changes that have materially impacted our business. One noteworthy move of the last several years has been more scrutiny in the banking sector. But the only effect has been our need to make some of our products more ready for reporting requirements and that shift has already occurred.At the societal level, there has been movement toward more concerned about data privacy with approaches, such as, the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR in Europe. The primary effect of this, is to reinforce the diligence we have always brought to keeping our data assets secure. Although data analytics, innovation and technology continue to evolve an increasing importance, the structure of our industry verticals is not changing to any material degree. In insurance, the global reinsurers and brokers have seen some consolidation as they work to adjust to a world in which risk can be borne directly by the capital markets. But the bulk of our work is with primary insurers and the reinsurers are being effective in modifying their businesses.And more generally, the effective digitization is to reduce distribution advantages and fixed costs, both of which will lessen the incentive to combine companies for cost advantage.The environment carries two trends, which pushed our costs in opposite directions. On the people front, we are increasing the mix of our team, which comes from the hard-core data science world. These folks are highly sought after and paid accordingly. On the technical infrastructure front, the move toward cloud computing and away from premise computing will reduce our computing and storage costs. We are in the early stage of seeing these benefits. So, our overall perspective is that the basic conditions of our environment remained constructive.What is down to therefore is the depth of our relationships with our customers and the capability of our team to innovate solutions and make them work for our customers. In the past 30 days, I've visited with four CEOs of our leading customers. In every case, I came away with an enhanced sense of opportunity. As they take their businesses forward in a digitizing environment, their expressed preference is for a relatively short list of partners, who can make sense of all the technical innovations and relate them to existing workflows. In such an environment, a trusted and tested partner like Verisk stands taller. As long as we continue to invest to keep our customers at the leading edge of innovation and do so with efficiency, we will realize value.On the talent front, I just received the results of our most recent employee engagement survey. We have once again qualified as a certified Great Place to Work. Additionally Forbes has named Verisk to it's World's Best Employers Lists and it's America's Best Employers for Women's Lists in 2018. This is supportive of our business, because our talent is what drives our customer depth and innovation agendas. We are expanding our business footprint globally, and in line with this, we are making moves to have centers of excellence in multiple geographies with special focus on India, and Eastern Europe.Lastly, our progress in the UK market remains encouraging with recent contract signings with market leaders. We are viewing our approach there as a template we will use as we target other specific markets in Europe and Asia.So with that, let me turn the call over to Mark. -- Thanks, Scott. In our insurance business, we had another strong quarter with all insurance facing businesses, underwriting and rating, as well as claims contributing to growth. Let me highlight a few areas that drove topline growth and update you on several initiatives that better position us for the future.During the quarter, underwriting and rating delivered another strong quarter of organic growth across personal lines underwriting, extreme event modeling and industry standard insurance program, through a combination of cross-sell of existing solutions to new customers and the sale of new innovative solutions. Our Risk and Analytics Summit recently took place in Jersey City, focusing on our underwriting and pricing solutions. We covered a wide range of topics, including industry disruption, talent drain in the insurance industry and cutting-edge technology, in combination with demonstrations to some of our newer solutions. The conference attracted about 150 insurance companies from around the world and featured a list of more senior level attendees this year.Feedback was very positive with participants excited by the direction of our solutions in complementary of the diverse and thought-provoking suggestion. The engagement with customers was strong, further cementing the type of relationship that has led to a high customer retention rates in Verisk, demonstrating the thought leadership in the property and casualty insurance industry that clients expect.In our extreme event modeling business, growth in AIR solutions remained strong. During the quarter, AIR Worldwide released Touchstone Re, a new catastrophe modeling application designed for estimating the loss potential of reinsurance contracts and portfolios, industry loss warranties and insurance-linked securities. Touchstone Re is a major upgrade from CATRADER that enables comfortably -- companies to model and price complex reinsurance structures, understand where their exposures are concentrated around the globe and summarize their portfolios and aggregate their overall risk.As you may recall, 2017 was marked by exceptional storms globally, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in United States. In fact, 2017 was a record setting year with catastrophe losses of more than $130 billion across the industry, which compares to an average loss of about $55 billion over the 10 years to prior to 2017. Our claims business benefited from the severe weather in third quarter of 2017, which resulted in a revenue surge of approximately $8 million. After normalizing revenue from severe weather, our claims business units experienced another very strong quarter with organic growth across all business units.Let me provide some color on these successes. The foundation of our claims business unit consisted two core solutions, ClaimSearch, our industry flood prevention solution and Xactware, our repair cost estimating and workflow tools. These solutions are well penetrated and deeply embedded in the workflows of US insurers. From this strong position, we have been successful in growing the business through a couple of avenues. The first path for growth is the sale of these core solutions to new segments. We continue to extend the consortium data in use cases for claims solutions, including new lines of insurance, such as health and disability.During the second half of 2017 and into 2018, we extended beyond insurance companies and have signed several contracts with service providers to help them manage their workflow and better serve their insurance customers. In addition, we continue to gain market share in the repair cost estimating market by signing new contracts during 2018 that have contributed to the growth. The second avenue of growth is the development of new analytics solutions, leveraging our underlying core solutions. A few examples of success, include , ClaimDirector. Our expert claim scoring systems that helps customers distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims. This proactive fraud fighting tool provides scores based on the analysis of each claims attributes, and the broader industry data from ClaimSearch.In addition, ClaimXperience, a digital engagement platform that provides insurance companies with important tools to help claims representatives work more effectively with policyholders. This workflow tool leverages the underlying Xactware solutions and helps ensurers to engage with their policyholders in their supply chain. Finally, Geomni, our business unit that aggregates an image library of commercial and residential structures, and leverages advanced analytics to extract measurements and data. Although applicable in many markets, Geomni's early success has been in the insurance claims adjusting market due to the tight integration with our exact repair cost estimating tools. This has resulted in noteworthy efficiencies for insurers and strong growth at Geomni, where we have signed several new contracts and has gained market share. Across all business from both a customer and financial perspective, we are very pleased with the performance of the insurance business.With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results. -- Thanks, Mark. First, I like everybody to know that we posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. The presentation provides some background data trends and analysis to support our conversation today. So moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and a GAAP basis, revenue grew 9% to $599 million. Net income was up 37.5% to $166 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.99 for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 37.5% compared with the same period in 2017.Before I begin discussing the financial results in more detail, I would like to call your attention to three exceptional items in the quarter that impact year-over-year comparisons. Number one; insurance segment organic constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth were impacted by $8 million in exceptional storm-related revenue in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2017. This was the result as Mark described, of exceptional client activity related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.Two; financial services segment, organic constant currency revenue growth, and adjusted EBITDA growth were impacted by $6 million in non-recurring TSYS project revenues in the third quarter of 2017 as we described in our last . These revenues were the result of the initiation and implementation of our partnership with TSYS and do not reoccur. We do anticipate over time, revenues from the joint marketing of our analytics products to TSYS customers. And three; in August 2018, the subordinated promissory note associated with the sale of our Healthcare business in 2016 was settled in full for cash proceeds of $121 million. As a result, we recorded a gain of $12 million in the third quarter of 2018. The interest income associated with this note was approximately $1 million per month or $3 million per quarter.Given the settlement timing, we recorded interest income of $2 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $3 million in the prior year's quarter. The related gain and the interest income from the note settlement were excluded from all adjusted EBITDA calculations. Please note that historically this interest income was included in adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, our ongoing adjusted EBITDA will be reduced by $3 million per quarter, mostly in the insurance segment.With those items covered, let's focus on our organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have a full year-over-year comparison and non-recurring items. Acquired revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic results were $32 million and $9 million respectively.On a reported organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA expense growth of 7.9% for adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.5%. The revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates reflect the impact of exceptional storm activity and the non-recurring TSYS revenue in the third quarter of the prior year. Normalizing for these events, revenue growth would have been 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.1%, reflecting organic growth across all our industry segments. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 48.5% was down slightly from 48.7% on a normalized basis in the prior period.Now, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you will see in table two in the press release, Insurance reported 5.5% revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.5%, reflecting the inclusion of exceptional storm revenue in the prior period. Excluding these events in the prior year, insurance revenue would have grown 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA would have grown 6.4%, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.3%, down from 55% in the prior year on a normalized basis due to continued investment in Geomni and other breakout opportunities, as well as higher commissions related to the strong sales and higher salary and benefit expenses to support growth opportunities.Within our underwriting and rating business, we saw solid performance with healthy growth in both personal and commercial lines. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance across most of our claims businesses, partially offset by a modest decline in our workers' compensation and claim resolution services.Energy and Specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 6.3% in the quarter, up from 5% in the prior quarter as the energy industry continues to recover. Growth improved in both our consulting and research solutions and we also had a positive contribution from environmental health and safety revenues. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.1%, also an improvement from 0.9% growth in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.8% was up from the prior-year period of 31%, despite the ongoing investments in WoodMac 2.0 and our chemicals subsurface and power and renewables breakouts that increased headcount and associated compensation expense. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood McKenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently.Financial Services revenue declined 9.2% in the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 28.6%, reflecting the impact of the non-recurring TSYS revenue of $6 million in the prior year period. On a normalized basis, revenue would have grown 9.1% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA would have grown 15.2%, reflecting growth in portfolio management solutions, which includes our foundational benchmarking analytics and spend in marketing solutions, where we are leveraging our data and expertise in consumer spending to support both financial and non-bank clients.In addition, expense control contributed to the strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.7% in the period compares to 32.8% in the prior year on a normalized basis. We continue to be encouraged by the progress in our Financial Services segment and certainly are pleased by the strong normalized results in this quarter, demonstrating the core growth potential of the business. It's important to keep in mind, that we are working to reduce the variability of revenue in the business, particularly around project based items. As we continue to work through this process, the Financial Services segment will continue to have a higher level of quarterly fluctuations on revenues and growth than our other segments.Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, up 6.6% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions in 2017. Total reported debt was $2.6 billion at September 30, 2018, down from $3 billion at December 31, 2017. We used the proceeds of $121 million from the repayment of the subordinated promissory note to pay down debt. And our leverage at the end of the third quarter was 2.2 times. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $152 million at September 30, 2018.Our reported effective tax rate was 13.9% for the quarter, compared to 33.2% in the prior year quarter as a result of recent tax reform. Our effective tax rate was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of soon-to-expire employee stock options related to our 2009 IPO, that produced a favorable tax rate impact. We are maintaining our estimate of our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 16% and 18%. However, the timing and impact of employee stock option exercises, depends in part on the Verisk stock price and personal decisions. We expect the impact from employee stock option exercises will be less pronounced in 2019, and thus we will revert it to a higher effective tax rate.Adjusted net income was $182 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.8 for the third quarter, up approximately 30% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and the impact of 2017 tax reform. Equalizing the third quarter of 2017 effective tax rate to that of third quarter 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 3.7% and 3.8% respectively. Further normalizing for the elevated storm and TSYS project related revenues in the quarter, net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 9.2% and 9.1% respectively.Net cash provided by operating activities was $227 million for the quarter, up 39.7% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $55 million for the quarter, up 33.7% from the prior year, reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni and software development for recent acquisitions.As we've discussed previously, 2018 will be the peak year of capital expenditure for Geomni. Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter, an increase of 41.8% for the prior year. We returned $102 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares in the quarter at a weighted average price of $117.97. At September 30th, we had $584 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And in addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the fourth quarter.In conclusion, I want to add an additional perspective. As you know, we are very focused in these calls on the results for the quarter. However, given the three items that impacted the quarter as we approach year-end, I think, it's useful to step back and look at our year-to-date results for the insurance segment and Verisk as a whole.For the year-to-date period, on an organic constant currency basis, and not, I repeat, not normalized for the exceptional storm activity, revenues were up 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA was up 7.6% demonstrating margin improvement. On the same basis and not normalized, Verisk revenues were up 6.3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 5.8%, reflecting a slight overall margin decline from 49% to 48.8% despite very high margins from the storm and nonrecurring project revenue in the third quarter of last year. These overall results, of course, reflected weaker performance of our non-insurance segments earlier in the year and tough comparisons in the third quarter. However, in the third quarter, we demonstrated continued progress in operating revenues and margins for both segments.We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on the long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk and we look forward to seeing many of you -- as many of you as possible at our upcoming Investor Day on December 6th in New York City or welcome your participation through our webcast. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us today, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up.With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning. Scott, my first question was just tied to your opening comments around digitization and the opportunity there. And I guess, more specifically, just in terms of the Decision Analytics side of insurance. Like how do you think that will perform if we do enter a period -- a tough period here in the next couple of years? -- I just want to clarify your questions, did you say, a tough period meaning the performance of -- the state of the insurance industry? -- Well, yeah. I mean, just, if you do hit a recession broadly, and just the insurance software. Like, how do you think the analytics piece of the -- of your insurance business -- -- I got it. I understand. Yeah, thank you. Well, the best answer to that, I think is, actually found in our own historical performance. There was a consecutive five-year period, where premiums were down year-over-year and our business performed very well during that period. And the reason is that, what the insurance companies need to do, whether they're in particularly strong moments of the cycle or weaker moments of the cycle is to continue to upgrade their ability to ingest information translated into insight and then reflect out in the way they price their product, structure their products, adjust claims around their products, et cetera. That is the work of the insurance companies and that's what we're fundamentally a part of.So, we're very comfortable with how our business -- our insurance business will do almost regardless of the cycle. I mean, I'm saying that very strongly, obviously, sort of extreme events in the moment can have an effect. But we've actually been through this and our business held up very well. -- Okay. And Mark, maybe just in terms of some of the new products and so forth you were calling out. I guess, maybe the one area maybe you can just update us on is the telematics initiatives. I mean, it sounds like all the insurance companies are, obviously, talking a lot more about it on their calls, but just curious, how we should think about when your exchange start driving some contributions? -- Yeah, thank you, and a question. I think we are very pleased with the position we're in, where we have these really exclusive arrangements with some of the larger OEMs and that has cemented us. So now, it's every day we have more cars, more miles and better data on that exchange. The early returns are really focused on two things. One, there's approach on the claims side to be easier and helpful to those driving your automobile. So think if an accident occurring, first of all, if there's some safety or public safety you need, ambulance can get you a ride, tow truck, but also led us quickly through a hot and ward transfer, notify the insurance carrier that there is a claim. So this is a first notice, well automated that is very attractive to all parties involved and that seems to be probably the place we lead.Secondly, we have found that a lot of carriers are taking the data and the information that is coming off, we call it, model ready data, but basically they're using the data to model and they're finding great lift in pricing policies using that industry or data exchange. So early days, I think, it will continue to grow. I would say, that we all think that IoT is happening, but probably at a slower pace than what we've seen in Europe and elsewhere. We remain optimistic and we'd love the position well. -- Thanks, guys.Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. -- Good morning. -- First, I wanted to ask about the insurance EBITDA. I think, Lee, you mentioned that there is going to be sort of $3 million lower in the future quarters in insurance EBITDA because of the interest expense recorded from that promissory note. I wanted to just make sure I had that right. And so basically, this quarter you adjusted that as well as the gain. So it would really be as if -- this quarter didn't have that, but prior quarters did. I just want to make sure I understood that right. -- Yeah. Thank you, Toni. I appreciate the opportunity Just to go into a little bit more detail on that. And so, you refer to it as interesting expense. Just to be clear on the note, there was an asset that we hold. We were receiving approximately $3 million of interest income on that note. And the reason that it's in EBITDA is that, under the SEC definition of EBITDA, you take net income and you add back interest expense, not net interest expense. So, it's included in that -- in that calculation. And so, since this was an acquisition related activity and we want to certainly separate out the gain and the impact of the interest income for comparability that the gain has been excluded.And then to the extent, that there is any interest income in the period, we have excluded from the third quarter of 2017, $3 million of that interest income from our EBITDA. And in the third quarter of 2018, $2 million of the interest income that we realized before its redemption. And so, the thing that we want for all of the analysts to understand is that, going forward, that $3 million which is in all of the segments, but the bulk of it is insurance. I would think of it at a corporate level of $3 million of EBITDA that comes out of our future quarterly results. Does that clarify things? -- It does. Thank you. And so my follow-up, I wanted to ask about energy. Really good strong organic growth quarter there. Just if you could give us a little bit more detail. I know, you mentioned the market is recovering. But just what are you hearing from clients? What are sort of some of the -- is it sort of driven by the consulting strength and basically, do you think that the positive trends should continue in the fourth quarter as well as into next year? Thanks. -- Yeah. So, maybe starting at the end of that Toni. The performance of that segment is really pretty broadly based. And what I mean by that is, it spans the kinds of solutions that we have traditionally provided. So sort of the core look at the supply chain of the oil and gas space, but also includes the upstream subsurface kinds of analytics which are relatively newer for us. Analytics related to the renewable forms of energy. And then kind of over the top on all of that, the digitizing trends that I talked about probably is differentially being felt more strongly in the energy space than it is in the others, because energy actually has started further behind.So, we've talked a lot about WoodMac 2.0 and essentially sort of changing our own technical infrastructure, which allows us to interact with our customers differently. That's a constructive movement in the business, because our customers themselves are also changing their digital methods on the commercial side of their businesses. So, it's really very broadly based. If you were to think of it in terms of -- sort of what it is that's getting delivered. And looking at where we have been in 2018 and where we're going in the future, we're always encouraged when we see consulting do well, because it tends to be a leading indicator of the propensity of our customers to be thinking into the future. And that has been strong. So that's an encouraging signal for us.But as those of you who are familiar with our story now, most of the revenues are related to subscriptions. And over the course of 2018, subscriptions have advanced nicely also. Across several of those telematics (ph) categories that I talked about. So, it's not really any one thing, it's really broadly based. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Hi, it's Andrew. I wanted to talk about two things around Argus. I know it's a smaller business for you. The first one. Scott, you said something about your prepared remarks about kind of changing products to I think just to regs. I was wondering if that's Argus related comment, because I remember in the second quarter, you talked about some rags about targeting within Argus that needed changes for the customers. And my question is, have those changes has been made and have customers move forward. And the second question is, the contracts that were announced in Analyst Day have those ramped up? -- Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, so to your question about the models. That comments in my remarks was it related to financial services and Argus specifically. And what's going on there just sort of reprieve that real quick is, that in the face of mounting regulation, the amount of documentation that is required on some of your models, if your bank or you are a credit card issuer have really, really ramped up. And so, we had created some offerings that were pretty popular with our customers and that summarize the lot into, what we call a wallet share model. And so if you're going to use sort of a wallet share model, what the regulators have said is, you cannot sort of operate that as a black box, you're going to have to show us what's inside of your black box.And so the -- sort of the burden for our customers of opening up the black box really got sort of pretty large. And so in the face of that, what we've done is, we have essentially disaggregated some of those models and sort of essentially taken the attributes which build up into the overall view, and that's what we are now making available to our customers. So, I just want everybody to understand that's the movement. So, the inside is still useful, but the way it gets presented has had to change. And then to your question, so in the third quarter of 2018, the net effect of moving -- some of our customers moving away from the wallet share models and moving into the attributes was essentially a drag on the revenue line in the third quarter. So the transition is not yet complete.What that means is, actually that there is upside for us going forward. We're feeling -- we have felt over the last couple of quarters the burden of that transition, And as we go forward, that's going to eventually even out or even move in the right direction. -- And Scott, I asked about the eight contracts from Analyst Day. -- Michael, let me take that one. So the answer is, from over this period, there has been a portion of those contracts that we have executed and have begun generating revenue. And then there have been a portion that has fallen out. I appreciate you're assiduousness in tracking that. It's not something that we are tracking on a regular basis, we're obviously looking at kind of the current portfolio. But we have realized some of those contracts and some of those, we did not get to get to execution on. And I can try to give you more detail on that once we've kind of researched and track those specific items as we have in the past, but I don't have those numbers in front of me. -- Okay, much appreciated. Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ham's Maseru with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. -- Good morning and thank you. My question is just around pricing. Just given inflation and the system, but more importantly, given your investment in data sets. Are you guys thinking about pricing differently than when you are owned by the insurance companies versus even just before you had Gemini. Just any sense on pricing philosophy and how that has changed and what we should think about going forward? -- Yeah. Our pricing philosophy is the same as it's always been, which is that we price to value. So, we're very focused on the utility of our solutions for our customers, and it's on that basis that we set the prices for solutions that we provide. And as has always been the case, our preference and the heart of our model is recurring subscriptions. And we find that that's good for our customers. They like knowing with some certainty what they're going to be paying for our solutions and it's good for us because of the visibility in the recurrence. So, we normally try to -- that's where we try to set our pricing model.There are some occasions where with newer solutions, particularly the customers would prefer that we started out transaction price, because they don't really know exactly how much of that they're going to consume as they begin using it. And so, we're perfectly happy to do that when that's what the customers want. But we generally find with times that they would like us to transition to subscription. And then the last thing I'll add is, as a part of our pricing philosophy, that we generally attempt to achieve mufti-year subscriptions with price inflates on an annual basis, which reflects the fact that, most of what we do is so basic to what our customers do it so embedded in their work flows that, it's just -- there's just sort of a mutual understanding that this is the way business is going to get done.And so our customers are comfortable with signing mufti-year agreements. And of course for us, that just represents an even higher level of recurrence. So everything I just said, has been a part of our of our approach since October of 2009, when you first saw us as a public company, and I'm very certain that will remain our go-to-market approach. -- Great. And just a follow-up question. I know you touched on healthcare a bit around insurance, maybe just remind us how much of your business today is not a P&C insurance? Specifically, auto, home, you touched on healthcare. And then maybe do you see any changes in terms of autonomous cars, connected homes impacting that business, just from our technology standpoint? Thanks. -- So Lee, in a minute. I'll let you just talk about the split of our revenues. But yeah, autonomous cars and Internet of Things, data coming from vehicles and from homes, very definitely a part of what we're doing. Those are constructive trends inside of our business and will only continue to be more important, especially for insurance companies. So, that's just sort of established inside of what it is, we're doing. Lee, do you want to just talk about the split of our business? -- And, Ham's, I think, it was first just to kind of start-up at a high level. Just from the overall insurance perspective for year-to-date 2018, the insurance segment represents 71% of our total revenue and 81% of our EBITDA. I think you were asking for a color around what portion of our revenues or our business composition is not P&C. And so, let me clarify, the vast majority of our insurance revenues are P&C related, and auto and home are -- what we do there is P&C Property and Casualty related. So, you may want some context around what portion is home-related or auto-related, and perhaps Mark can give you some perspective around that. I don't know that we have that breakout, because it's embedded in for instance our ISO and our claims businesses together. But perhaps, we can talk around that. Is that the sort of information that you were looking for? -- Yes, exactly. -- And so, maybe that's something we can come back to you and try to give you the breakout on some of those other components, but we don't have those, a sense of that right now. -- Yeah, we can do it offline. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys. -- Good morning. -- Scott, your high level industry comments are always much appreciated for perspective. And one of the things, I think, you said -- you touched a little bit on the insurance industry consolidation, and obviously, you have seen that flow through your business for the last few years and then I think, you made some comments on perhaps reinsurance. I wonder, if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of how the industry is changing via consolidation and what specifically you think that means to your business, maybe shorter term or intermediate term? I assume longer term is not as big an impact? But I just wonder, if you could maybe be a little more granular. -- Yeah, sure. So, just all the way to the top, just talking about what the demography of the industry looks like. At the top end of the market, there are a certain number of consolidations each year. My emphasis here would be on the fact that, it's really not a very large number. But also bear in mind that there are new entrants into the insurance space on a consistent basis and several of these are what get referred to as the insured tax. Sometimes, they're innovating based upon the way that they segment the market, you have some innovation in terms of, say, peer-to-peer forms of insurance which are kind of interesting, but they haven't really -- they haven't expressed themselves yet as particularly big trends.But think of it as an industry, where, yes, there is some consolidation at one end of the market, but there is also entry at the other end of the market. We do -- we have done very well with the new entrants. They find it really helpful to be able to make use of our methods as they get started. They are efficient, it helps them get into business quickly, it's actually a credibility for them as they do their business et cetera. So, as we talk about sort of the evolution -- and this is very real-time. What I'm describing here is these new companies come into the market, we find that they are vary inclined to work with us.When consolidations occur, and again, my emphasis here would be to how relatively few of them happen. But when they do occur, it's very situation specific in terms of what it does to our business. There maybe some cases, where the two companies coming together have -- they're very overlapping in their use of various solutions. And in that case, they very reasonably expect to that like-on-like there might be some reduction in the total invoiced amount for the solution that the two companies were using and now the one aren't using. But there are frequently offsets to that also, because it's also the case that one company maybe using our solutions and the other company is not. And in those cases, actually there is a very nice cross-sell opportunity within that same account.And so, when we go through these transitions with our customers were two become one. We dig in very deeply and talk to them about everything that they're using that comes from us and the things that they're not. There can be an effect, maybe in year one, although not particularly large. And then on an ongoing basis, generally, the profile of the account going forward, the growth profile is -- I think, Mark check me on this. But I think is generally about the same as it was before the two companies became one. So, we note consolidation. And as I say, it's very situation specific. But it's not a major effect on our business, anything you want to add to that? -- I think the only thing -- I think you were trying to get a little feel for it. I think, we feel that 2017 on the primary side of things, it was kind of business is normal. I think, there is some reinsurance mergers that may have a little bit of a headwind as it relates to more of our cat modeling business. That would be my high level short term view of things, if that helps? -- I mean, there might be a few more situations like, where AXA and XL Catlin came together and that's an interesting one, because I think, that one actually represents a fair amount of opportunity for us. But I mentioned that one, because that has sort of a global geographic markets to mention and it's also reinsurance sort of being layered more directly on top of insurance inside of one specific company. So I think, you may see some of that, but that's actually the most constructive kind of consolidation I can imagine for us -- constructive for us. -- That's certainly helpful. Thank you. And Scott, I think you also made a comment, maybe Mark, it was in your comments about Geomni share gains, I wonder if you could just talk about from whom Geomni is taking share? -- Well, there is only few competitors in the market, and I think we've been fortunate to deliver value and provide a quickly integrated solution that has been appealing to several insurers and service providers. So, we continue to see some opportunities and good pipeline as well as closed sales. So, that's contributing to the growth you're seeing in 2018 and should continue into the future. -- Thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Tim Mchugh with William Blair. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks. I Just wanted to follow up on -- there was an earlier question about Wood Mackenzie and Energy, I guess, more broadly. I understood that kind of broad comment. I guess, but can you help us drill down into how we should think about the growth trend within the subscription piece. The high level number in the earnings release about subscription revenue, and percentage of revenue from subscription would suggest. It has very strongly driven the growth in that segment by the consulting piece. And so, I understand there is a comparison with the loss of one contract, there'll be some noise there. Can you give more color to help us understand the progress? Or how much progress, I guess has being made on growing subscription revenue for that business? -- Yeah, actually, quite a bit of progress has being made on subscriptions. And again, I think you do need to look beyond one quarter to say a year or even multiple years. But since, we really called the turn on the business which would have been just referencing my notes here, about, I guess about 10 months ago or so. The progression of the subscriptions from that has looked very much like what we would expect, and is very supportive of the -- our view that this is a business which can be -- can perform above the rate of organic growth of all of Verisk, actually. So in the quarter, it happens that, the transaction revenues were particularly strong. And yes, we are working our way through one substantial subscription agreement that went off the book since 2018. We talked about that. But I think, that over intermediate and long periods of time, subscription revenue growth will be equal to or probably even exceed the rate of consulting. Just kind of, they will both be very strong contributors. But what we're focused on is subscription revenue growth. That's the heart of our business. -- It's, Scott. Maybe, I'll add some perspective. I think, Tim, that when we think about the subscription growth and kind of the core subscriptions, kind of putting aside some of the breakouts, and the breakouts are also largely subscription-oriented and research-oriented. And we have seen steady progress in the growth rate and new subscriptions in kind of the mid-single digits category, before we factor in the breakouts. And then we look at the breakouts and those have been very strong growth as we penetrated those new areas. And so, that gives us confidence, that moves us more into kind of a higher single digits range. And then on top of that, we have the consulting revenue, which as you point out was strong. Now, in consulting revenue and the growth that we saw and experienced was clearly a significant contributor to the overall growth. But we certainly see continued progress in that strength and the improvement in subscription growth supplemented by the breakout subscription growths which are at a high level. So, that maybe give you some context on relative growth rates to complement Scott's perspective.I guess the last point I would make is, that a lot of the subscription renewals occur in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So to a degree, it's not really quite surprising that the third quarter be relatively a little quieter with respect to subscriptions. -- Okay. And then, Lee just a follow up to that. Are those growth when you say, mid single-digits in the core and high single , including the breakout. Are you excluding the loss of the --the impact of this customer that you lost? -- Yeah, what I'm referring to are kind of are, what we're experiencing currently. And so, that reflects the impact of that loss of that large global investment bank. And so, I think as we've talked about in the past, that's kind of roughly a percentage point drag from a growth standpoint. -- Okay, thank you. -- Okay.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thank you. A couple the segment level margin questions. So first, on insurance, I know that there's other factors in here like the income from the year ago and the interest income effect, but just on the aerial imagery investments. I guess, can you just maybe talk about where you're at in that investment cycle? What's you're investing in terms of product, because I understand the planes and sensor investments, but I think that would flow through CapEx. So just on the margin impact, I guess where you're at on the aerial imagery product and what you're investing in currently? -- Sure. So, just let me at me approach it this way. So, yes, there is, certainly the bulk of the investment from a capital standpoint is going into purchasing planes and sensors in operations, and so that's something that we've talked about before, that will peak in 2018. We expect that will come down. Further as we are ramping up our the pilots and the personnel in order to drive that, that is effectively an additional investment. And as we are gathering and expanding the scope and the breadth of data, and so that is factored in and you see that in the P&L.To kind of give you some context, when we look at that impact across Verisk as a whole, that contributes about 1% roughly of our expense growth. And so, that gives you some context for the scale of that of that impact. It has a lesser impact currently on revenue, but we are obviously we are growing at a high rate. And so that translates into a slightly also smaller impact on EBITDA. So that kind of gives you kind of a sense of the scale of that investment. Mark, something you wanted to add to that? -- All I was going to say is, once you get those planes in those centers, you now need to put in the sky. So, we're looking to drive coverage as far as both nationwide and frequency. So we can see changes in property. So, that causes us to have to put up pilots in the plane, there is cost to operate, there's maintenance on the planes. Clearly, then we take all the imagery we process it, we're trying to use it for different use cases and we're extending the analytic capabilities of the team to provide underwriting use cases, extending the claims and cat exposure. So, I want to just emphasize, there's an OpEx piece as we continue to do a lot of advanced analytics along with build out coverage and kind of capability. -- And I think one thing to bear in mind, I think as Mark was describing, the benefits, the use of this data spans across multiple of our businesses. And so, it will have revenue impacts and EBITDA impacts positively, as we try to leverage that data across the business. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then on the energy and specialized markets margins has been quite good. I feel like a couple of quarters ago, you were calling out some investments there with WoodMac 2.0 and the breakout initiatives. And I don't know if you are more describing why when you started presenting segment margins, they were lower than investors might have expected. I just, I guess, I wanted to confirm that there wasn't some delay in those investments, they're are progressing as planned and the good margin we're seeing on a year-over-year basis in that segment is even with that investment. Thank you. -- Yeah. So, the -- certainly, there has been a level of investment that we've been making in WoodMac 2.0 as well as in the breakout opportunities that we have been investing in that have an impact. Those are proceeding as we expect. The WoodMac 2.0 will be an investment cycle that certainly existed in 2018 and will persist through 2019 as we expand that platform and in that we are already beginning to see some benefits of that within the business. But there will be continued CapEx investment, continued OpEx investment in that through 2019. And so, that's embedded in those margin numbers. And I think, one of the benefits that we saw is that, we had good cost control, headcount growth was I think a little lower this quarter, having brought on some of the development folks that we needed on that front. And so, that contributed to the clear improvement in margin that we saw in the third quarter. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, everyone. -- Good morning. -- So, first question, just a clarification on the storm contribution adjustment. I know that last year was a major year for storms and outsized gains from that. But there were also severe storms in the third quarter of '18. And so, when you make that adjustment, how much storm revenue -- was there -- the storm revenue contribution from the third quarter of '18 also backed out. I just want to understand the mechanics of that adjustment? -- So Bill, I guess our view is that 2017 was truly an exceptional year. There's always going to be severe weather. '18 is going to be in our mind there was something really strange happens here at the latter part of the years, its going be a normal year of severe weather. So, I don't think we see anything adjusted or any adjustments to normalization in '18. We've been focused on '17, because of the exceptional aspect. Let me just remind everybody, the way many of our contracts, specifically the Xactware repair cost estimating contracts work is, that we provide access to the solution for a number of claims. And then when you quit a threshold, you then get charged per claim at excess rate. It takes quite a substantial threshold or number of volume -- out of volumes to get above that threshold. I don't think we're going to see much of that in '18, '17 was noteworthy. -- And then from my follow up, Nielsen has been talking about how the GDPR regulation has been negatively impacting their marketing effectiveness business. And I know that they're a big user of the Argus data. And the Argus organic revenue growth showed a nice rebound in the third quarter. So, I wanted to ask, is that rebound taking place despite or even with that GDPR headwind. Is that something that you're seeing that you're able to overcome? -- Yes, so GDPR is a contextual factor for us, but not one that I can say is really interacting with our results near term. And as long as we protect our data assets, the way that we have and, I expect we will. I do not believe there it will be a material impact going forward. So, I can't comment on somebody else's control of the effective of the regulation. But where our business is concerned, the primary effect of it at the interface with our customers is, we have an extended discussion about contracts because we need to now talk about the assignment of liability at a higher level. We always had to talk about it, but we talked about it more than we used to. That's really the only effect that I see. And it's not material. -- Got it. Well, thank you very much, and Happy Halloween. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. So, I guess the first question. When I look back to the beginning of 2017, pretty clearly, you've had a significant investment cycle here, 20 some acquisitions in the meaningful internal step up things like Geomni, the WoodMac platform, et cetera. Can you just frame for us, how you think about the returns to the business that this investment cycle will deliver going forward. And I guess, I'm wondering, things like, should we think of this as incremental to revenue growth or really just bolstering the business, so it can continue to deliver. How do we think about the step down in margins and how that may trend over time and anything about how you're thinking about the return on this? Thank you. -- Right, good. So, I'll ask Lee to talk about margins in a moment. But with respect to the investments that we've made, very substantially, they go in the direction of putting us into new categories of solution sets that we otherwise either haven't provided or we have provided in ways that haven't fully expressed what it is we can do for customers. So for example, the acquisition of PowerAdvocate puts us in a category of spend analytics for the energy vertical that we weren't doing before. The Sequel acquisition puts us in a position to serve the London market, particularly with respect to complex commercial risks in a way that we weren't able to serve it before. And then, all the investments that we've done in Geomni, we were in the category of interpreting remote imagery into datasets into analytics for our customers.The issue that we had was, we didn't have enough high quality raw material. And so, a lot of the investment as you heard Mark saying on the Geomni side, was basically to put ourselves in a position to have a lot of great raw material. So again, that is very much aimed at putting us into a new and different position for enhanced revenue growth on the top line. So -- and then other internal investments, the same. WoodMac 2.0 will carry with it some efficiency gains, but it also makes us more capable in front of our customers. So, very much it is about contributing to incremental growth of our business. Its not about the maintenance of things that we already do.And that is also really part of our feeling about the likely returns of these investments that we're making, which as you would imagine, revenue ramps, most everything we do is scalable. So, as these investments mature and the revenues grow, I would expect to see it be constructive with respect to margin. And also, even if you look at more than just say a quarter and maybe Lee, you want to pick up here a little bit. You know, we still see constructive progression in the organic EBITDAs inside of our business relative to the organic revenue growth rates. -- I would just just quickly add, in addition to what Mark described to develop new sources of revenue growth or enhance the revenue growth that we're generating off of our data. We are also making investments for instance in cloud modernization that we think will yield overall improved returns on capital and improved margins for us. So, we are making those types types of investments as well. And we look at each of those investments on the basis of what type of return are we generating, whether it's through savings or through incremental profitability. So thanks, Gary. -- Great. Thanks. And then just the follow-up for me, so you've lapped three of the four chunkier, larger acquisitions from 2017 during this quarter. I know you don't like to talk about forward margin trends. But is there anything you'd call out that would lead us from believing the reasonable pathway here as to having lapped a lot of that drag that there's been in your profitability goes away at this point or soon? I realize you've got a tough comp in Q4 with the Insurance comparison, but anything else you'd call out or is it reasonable of having lapped a lot of that, things look better from here? Thank you. -- So, Gary, I think it's important to understand your frame of reference, because what we do try to accomplish with our organic constant currency margins is to look at the business on an apples-to-apples basis, so that the business isn't influenced by those trends. You will see in the difference between our reported and our organic margin that delta reflecting the impact of some of the acquisitions before we have a year-over-year comparison, and those also include some transition costs associated with those businesses. So, I think perhaps what you're seeing is a narrowing of the difference between that reported and the organic margin numbers, which I think reflects what you're describing is effectively the business is now absorbing that. We still have -- I think in the fourth quarter, we still have PowerAdvocate that is outside of that. So there still will be some adjustments for that, but we are narrowing that gap. -- Great. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. -- Hi. I was wondering to what extent do you think you could provide -- and I don't want to take anything away from the Analyst Day, but a medium or longer-term outlook for the growth rates for the segments? -- So, Joe, thanks for that. We do provide, as we described before, our target revenue and EBITDA growth rates, and what we've said is that over the long term we expect all of our businesses to deliver on those growth targets. So beyond that, we don't provide separate for that. I kind of think implied by that, obviously, the Insurance business is going to be expected to deliver on those growth rates and we certainly expect over time. And or I should say, based on historical performance, have seen both the Financial Services and, we believe, Wood Mackenzie have delivered on higher growth rates than that. And we certainly believe that that's an opportunity ahead of us in something that we are working toward. But those we are focused on our overall Verisk growth rates and each of the businesses are expected to meet those objectives. -- Got it. So, essentially those are kind of unchanged as of right now, just to be clear. And then the second question is, without being sort of on the inside of the business, maybe you could give us the top two or three drivers of margins at this particular juncture and any area where you think there might be some volatility on the margin targets going forward. Thanks. -- Yeah. So, from an overall standpoint, the important driver of margin improvement is our ability to leverage our cost base in our businesses are data businesses, across a broader customer set, and so that's the fundamental driver of that an additional subscription of our existing dataset, however, broadly we define that, is going to have a very high margin and one that is in all likelihood higher than our overall margin. And that's the fundamental dynamic that drives our confidence in our operating leverage and our ability to achieve that. I'd say beyond that, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient with the resources that we have.And so, Mark has been driving an initiative on looking at how we can be more efficient by leveraging our scale internationally within the business. And so, given that personnel costs represent about 70% of our cost base, we're always looking for how we can improve productivity from that base, which is something that Scott emphasizes highly in our discussions with the business. So, I think that's another dimension to what we do. And then from a technological standpoint, as I talked about, investment in cloud technology is something that we think has the opportunity to improve our margins, not just by reducing our technology costs, but by facilitating our development of products and our clients' interactions with data that kind of further extend kind of the initial dynamic that I talked about.So those, I think, would be three of kind of the things that drive our margins. -- Thank you.Our final question will come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- I have a question about organic EBITDA margin performance. You'd cited elevated investments in Geomni, breakout opportunities, and commission performance as drivers of the contraction, even on a normalized basis on a year-over-year basis. So, looking forward, can you talk about how you expect these investments to evolve and your general philosophy around organic EBITDA margin performance if you're targeting expansion over the near-to-intermediate term? -- Sure. So, George, let me take a crack at that. I think that there are a couple dynamics that we think about from organic margin performance. The first is starting with, at the highest scale level, are the growth of our business where we expect revenue growth to exceed expense growth, and that drives an overall expansion of that organic margin. Offsetting that in the near-term are investments that we make in new initiatives that are going to be -- at the outset going to be lower margins, but we believe that those margins will ramp-up quickly and be additive overall to the business. And so that has a near-term impact. And then as you described, the impact of acquisitions that may have a lower margin initially, and some of them may have a lower margin permanently, which may be dilutive to the impact, but each of them we expect in the businesses that we look at have a high degree of operating leverage.And we have an ability to improve their operating leverage over time improving margins for the business as a whole. But recognizing that we have businesses with exceptional margins, what we focus on in addition to overall driving margin growth for the business as a whole and in aggregate and consistent with our long-term targets of growing EBITDA faster than revenue, we also look at our returns on capital for those investments in new businesses. So, core growth in the business is the fundamental driver. We are making investments near-term that will diminish near-term margin, that's a function of the investment, but hopefully expand our growth and improve margins over time.And then the impact of acquisitions. Some of which we think have higher margin, all of them we expect to have higher margin over time, but they may -- as a function of their impact in the business, may be lower margin, but represent higher growth opportunities and higher return opportunities. So, hopefully that gives you kind of the perspective on the dynamics for that margin. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then turning to your Insurance business, if you look at the organic constant currency growth rate normalizing for weather from last year, it did still step-down from second quarter growth rate. Can you talk about any unusual drivers in the quarter that might have contributed to a normalized deceleration in Insurance constant currency organic growth? And maybe the momentum of the business over the course of the quarter and exiting the quarter? -- So maybe I'll try to take that. This is Mark. I think if you were to actually look back on 2017, I think the answer really lies there. We had probably a little bit of a slower start to the year 2017, and we had kind of a stronger growth at the second half. So, I think we referenced this maybe a little tougher comps in the third and fourth quarter just because of the nice pickup we had, some of it catch-up with first half of '17. What I'd just like to emphasize, and I think Lee did a nice job of it, is year-to-date we have had a very strong year from Insurance. We feel good about the direction of the business. We feel great about the relationship and the level of engagement we have with customers, and I do believe that the number of and breadth of new solutions we have provides an exciting year forward. So, I hope that emphasizes and answers your question. -- Got it. Thank you.I'll now turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. -- Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Appreciate your interest and we look forward to seeing many, hopefully all of you at Investor Day in just a few weeks.

" stock has rallied 27.8% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the 11.8% rise of the  it belongs to.Verisk's expertise in providing predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect and interpret different types of data sets is impressive. The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing. The majority of the technologies used by Verisk are developed, maintained and supported by almost 20% of its employees. Its efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying client demands and its technical prowess in analytics and Big Data provide Verisk an edge over its competitors.Higher organic revenue growth through a combination of increase in new customers for existing solutions, cross-sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and the sale of new solutions will help Verisk create long-term value. In the first nine months of 2018, total revenues grew 7% organically and 6.3% on an organic constant-currency basis. This marks an improvement from 2017 when total revenues grew 4.5% organically and 5.3% on an organic constant currency basis.Moreover, Verisk continues to earn a major portion of its revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements. In the first nine months of 2018, Verisk's three reportable segments: Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services generated a respective 81%, 78% and 72% of revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements for its solutions.Acquisitions have also been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. In 2018 so far, the company has acquired three companies -Validus-IVC Limited on Jun 20, Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5. While the buyout of Validus will help improve and automate the claims settlement process, the other two acquisitions will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.Verisk's balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $2.04 billion while cash and cash equivalents was $147.6 million. Such a cash position implies that Verisk needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Since Verisk's business model centers on huge amount of data, it remains susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches at its facilities, computer networks, and databases, resulting in loss of its credibility and/or customers. Dependence on external sources for data supply can lead to contractual and pricing issues with data suppliers (some of them are also its rivals).Verisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .A few better-ranked stocks in the broader  include Paychex, Inc.  , Genpact Limited  and WEX Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Paychex, Genpact and WEX is 8.5%, 10% and 15%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Horizon Managed Volatility Domestic ETF (Symbol: HUSV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $25.15 per unit.With HUSV trading at a recent price near $21.11 per unit, that means that analysts see 19.14% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of HUSV's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Walt Disney Co. (Symbol: DIS), Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK), and Aon plc (Symbol: AON). Although DIS has traded at a recent price of $100.35/share, the average analyst target is 22.02% higher at $122.44/share. Similarly, VRSK has 21.49% upside from the recent share price of $103.04 if the average analyst target price of $125.18/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AON to reach a target price of $166.56/share, which is 21.18% above the recent price of $137.44. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DIS, VRSK, and AON:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts See 19% Upside For The Holdings of HUSV@2018-12-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-see-19-upside-holdings-husv-2018-12-26
 is scheduled to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 30, after market close.While we expect the company's top line to do well on the back of segmental strength, the bottom line is likely to be positively impacted by solid organic growth, 2017 tax reform policy (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and contributions from acquisition.So far this year, shares of Verisk have gained 18%, significantly outperforming the 8.4% rally of the  it belongs to and 2.6% rise of the Zacks S&P 500 Composite Index.Let's check out the expectations in detail.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $599.87 million, indicating a 9.3% year-over-year increase. The top line is expected to benefit from solid revenue growth across all the three segments - Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services. The segments are also expected to improve organically as well as on an organic constant-currency basis.Insurance segment revenues are expected to be driven by strength across its two units - Underwriting & rating and Claims. While strength in the company's catastrophe modeling services and underwriting solutions should boost Underwriting & rating revenues, Claims top line is likely to benefit from repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics and aerial imagery solutions revenues.Improvement in the energy business's end market, favorable currency movement and growth in environmental health and safety services revenues are likely to drive Energy and Specialized Markets segment.The Financial Services segment is likely to get a boost from rise in enterprise data management and portfolio management solutions revenues. | In second-quarter 2018, revenues increased 14.9% year over year on a reported basis, 8.3% organically and 7.4% on an organic constant-currency basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.07, indicating year-over-year growth of 27.4%.

erisk Analytics (VRSK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This insurance data provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27.4%.Revenues are expected to be $599.87 million, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.35% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Verisk, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verisk will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Verisk would post earnings of $1.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of +4.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Verisk doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $120.80, changing hands for $120.97/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $105.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $130.00. The standard deviation is $10.622.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $120.80/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $120.80 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the June 2019 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $101.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $114.81/share today.Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 9% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.33% return on the cash commitment, or 5.09% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $114.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.40% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"arren Buffett's  (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) manages a staggering $200 billion, and while Buffett is best known for his own-it-forever stock-picking approach, he's not afraid to sell companies when he feels his money can be best put to use elsewhere.Because Berkshire Hathaway's so big, it tends to own huge stakes in companies that take months to unwind, so the prospect of being on the wrong side of an investment Buffett's soured on isn't a pleasant one. Fortunately, the stocks Berkshire Hathaway is selling are revealed every quarter in a 13F report it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to its latest disclosure,  (NASDAQ: VRSK) ,  (NYSE: PSX) ,  (NASDAQ: AAL) , and  (NYSE: UAL) all fell out of favor at Berkshire Hathaway last quarter.Berkshire Hathaway was one of the founders of Verisk Analytics back in the 1970s, and it was the only founding member of the company to hold on to all its shares when Verisk went public in 2009.IMAGE SOURCE: THE MOTLEY FOOL.In the second quarter, that long history came to an end. As I detailed in May, Verisk Analytics fell to an  position for Berkshire Hathaway in the first quarter of 2018 and, sure enough, Berkshire Hathaway unloaded its remaining 284,778 shares last quarter.Buffett's mum on why he decided now is the right time to sell, but the company's expansion into other markets that's reduced its reliance on property and casualty insurance clients like Berkshire Hathaway's GEICO could be a factor. It's also likely that Verisk Analytics rally to all-time highs this year made booking his gain too attractive. For perspective, the company IPO'd at $22 and its share price was recently north of $116.The fact Verisk Analytics has marched higher despite Berkshire Hathaway selling its shares is intriguing and now that Berkshire doesn't have anymore shares left to sell, it will be interesting to see what happens next for this company's share price. In the past, stocks such as  and  have ticked higher following Berkshire's exit. But Berkshire's stake in Verisk Analytics was markedly smaller than it was in those Goliaths and therefore Berkshire's selling likely wasn't much of a weight holding down Verisk's share price.Nevertheless, it might be worth keeping an eye on Verisk Analytics because its sales and earnings are growing. In Q2, revenue rose 15% to $601 million, including 7% organic constant currency growth, and earnings per share increased 29% to $1.06.
  
Positions current as of June 30, 2018. Data source: Berkshire-Hathaway SEC form 13F, filed Aug. 14, 2018.Perhaps Buffett's decision to sell more shares in Phillips 66, an oil and gas transport, storage, refining, and marketing company, this quarter was most surprising. Berkshire Hathaway sold 35 million shares of Phillips 66 in Q1. However, that decision appeared to be prompted by a desire to reduce Berkshire's stake below 10% to reduce regulatory burdens.Berkshire Hathaway came into the second quarter owning about 9.8% of Phillips 66, down from 16% previously, but apparently that wasn't small enough. In Q2, Buffett sold another 10.9 million shares, reducing Berkshire Hathaway's position by about 24% to 34.7 million shares.The decision to sell was made even as Phillips 66 shares were hitting new highs and ahead of second-quarter financial results that beat industry watchers' estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Specifically, the company's revenue rose 21% to $29.7 billion and its diluted EPS skyrocketed to $2.84 from $1.06 in Q2 2017. Its refining business was its best performer, generating $910 million in net income, up from $224 million one year ago.Often, significant selling of a stock by Berkshire Hathaway suggests its selling will continue. Because Phillips 66's refining capacity utilization was at 100% last quarter,  are near their highs, and Phillips 66's stock has been rallying, now could be a good time to book some profit in this stock, especially since Berkshire still owns a lot of shares it could sell.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Berkshire Hathaway bought a slate of airline stocks when it first included them in its portfolio in 2016, but recently, Buffett's been  his exposure to  (NYSE: LUV) and  (NYSE: DAL) and reducing Berkshire's holdings of American Air and United Continental.Rising jet fuel and nonfuel costs have dented the industry's profit margins in the past year and American's and United Continental's 9% operating margins significantly trail Southwest's and Delta's. American arguably has one of the least favorable balance sheets of the four because of a heavy debt load and worry costs could continue pressuring profit have made it a poor performer this year. Alternatively, United Continental's share price has rallied nicely in 2018, particularly following its second-quarter financial results. In the quarter, United Continental offset more of its costs with rising revenue per average seat mile than anticipated,  to up its full-year adjusted earnings-per-share guidance to at least $7.25 from at least $7 previously.Warren Buffett's preference for Southwest and Delta Air could indicate he's settled on those two as his favorite plays in the industry, and if so, investors might want to consider selling some of their shares in American and United Continental. As of June, Berkshire Hathaway still owns 26.7 million shares in United Continental and 44.7 million shares of American Airlines, so if he continues to unwind those positions, it could present a stiff headwind for their share prices.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Earnings were driven by strong organic growth, 2017 tax reform and contributions from acquisitions. However, these were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, interest expenses as well as higher share count.Quarterly revenues of $601.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $586.2 million. The figure improved 14.9% year over year on a reported basis and 7.4% on an organic constant-currency (cc) basis.

The improvement was primarily driven by strength in the company's catastrophe modeling services and underwriting solutions. Claims revenues of $140.5 million improved 16.7% on a reported basis and 13.2% at organic cc. The uptick can be attributed to revenues from repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics and aerial imagery solutions.As energy business' end market continues to improve,  segment revenues of $129.9 million were up 17.7% on a reported basis and 5% at organic cc.

 stock has rallied 21.8% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the 14.3% rise of the  it belongs to.The company is currently benefiting from acquisitions, solid organic growth and the 2017 tax reform policy. Its expertise in providing predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies raises optimism.Verisk reported impressive second-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.06 surpassed the consensus mark by 5 cents and improved 29.3% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $601.3 million beat the consensus estimate of $586.2 million. The figure was up 14.9% year over year on a reported basis, 8.3% on an organic basis and 7.4% on an organic constant-currency basis.Verisk's expertise in providing predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect and interpret different types of data sets look impressive. The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing. The majority of the technologies used by Verisk are developed, maintained and supported by almost 20% of its employees. Efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying client demands and its technical prowess in analytics and Big Data provide Verisk an unrivalled edge over its competitors.Higher organic revenue growth through a combination of increase in new customers for existing solutions, cross-sale of its existing solutions to existing customers and the sale of new solutions will help Verisk create long-term value. In first half of 2018, total revenues grew 8.3% organically and 7.2% on an organic constant-currency basis. This marks an improvement from 2017, wherein total revenues grew 4.5% organically and 5.3% on an organic constant currency basis.Moreover, Verisk continues to earn a major portion of its revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements. In the first half of 2018, Verisk's three reportable segments: Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services generated a respective 81%, 79% and 75% of revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements for its solutions.Acquisitions have been contributing to Verisk's bottom-line growth. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. From 2015-2017, the company completed 21 acquisitions. In 2018 so far, the company has acquired three companies -Validus-IVC Limited on Jun 20, Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5. While the buyout of Validus will help improve and automate the claims settlement process, the other two acquisitions will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.We are also impressed with Verisk's consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Since the launch of the company's share repurchase plan in May 2010, the company's board of directors has authorized up to $3.3 billion for the purpose, which includes an additional authorization of $500 million approved on May 16, 2018. In the first half of 2018, Verisk repurchased 1,711,166 shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $180.4 million. As of Jun 30, 2018, the company had $685.8 million available for share buyback under its repurchase program. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Verisk repurchased shares worth $276.3 million, $326.8 million and $20.4 million, respectively. Such moves indicate the company's commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.Verisk's balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Jun 30, 2018, long-term debt was $2.04 billion while cash and cash equivalents were $132 million. Such a cash position implies that Verisk needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Since Verisk's business model centers on huge amount of data, it remains susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities, computer networks, and databases, resulting in loss of its credibility and/or customers. Dependence on external sources for data supply can lead to contractual and pricing issues with data suppliers (some of them are also its rivals).Currently, Verisk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see A few better-ranked stocks in the broader  include Genpact  , Automatic Data Processing  and Broadridge  . All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rate for Genpact, Automatic Data Processing and Broadridge is 10%, 11.3% and 10%, respectively.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

he global business information industry is currently benefiting from rising demand for risk mitigation services. Changes in market dynamics are more or less a constant phenomenon and keep companies exposed to credit fund and operational risks. Accurate market and financial information is required for risk mitigation and that spurs demand for business information services. Technavio expects global business information market to witness CAGR of more than 5% in 2021.In the United States, steady economic growth, rise in corporate earnings on tax reforms, increased business spending along with the presence of a large number of big companies that provide business information services has kept the industry in good shape.Looking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the broader economic recovery is enhancing investors' confidence in the industry.The  , which is a group within the broader  , has outpaced the S&P 500 and its own sector in the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 26.5%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Business Services Sector have rallied 15.6% and 21.8%, respectively (the blue line in the chart below represents the industry).The strong run in share prices over the past year have, however, led to a relatively rich valuation.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis  , we see that the industry's 22.6X is ahead of the S&P 500's 17.1X. It does, however, compare favorably with the sector's 23.3X.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of , we see that the industry's 2.1X is again ahead of the S&P 500's 1.8X. It is also ahead of the sector's 2X.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of  , we see that the industry's 2.1X is again ahead of the S&P 500's 1.8X. It is also ahead of the sector's 2X.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of , we see that the industry's 28.5X is again ahead of the S&P 500's 23.3X. It is also ahead of the sector's 18.1X.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of  , we see that the industry's 28.5X is again ahead of the S&P 500's 23.3X. It is also ahead of the sector's 18.1X.So any way you cut it, the industry is overvalued.Constantly increasing volume of data from private and government organizations has augmented the demand for improved enterprise-wide financial performance visibility. Augmented demand for news, information, and analytics solutions will drive the growth of the market. An improving economy and Trump's business friendly moves are benefiting manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing sectors, which, in turn, are aiding business information services.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The earlier valuation discussion shows that market participants have been willing to pay up for these stocks already, potentially limiting further upside from the current levels.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects for a solid price performance going forward is the industry's earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $3.62 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Gaming industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the earnings of $3.62 per share of the industry for 2018, but how this number has evolved recently.As you can see here, the $3.62 EPS estimate for 2018 is up from $3.58 at the end of March and $3.32 at the end of July 2017. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks Business - Information Services Industry have been steadily raising their estimates.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Business - Information Services Industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #73, which places it at the top 29% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.While the near-term prospects look welcoming for investors, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Business - Information Services Industry appears promising. The group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate is at the current level of 11.4%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be the recovery in the top line that the Zacks Consulting Services industry has been showing since the beginning of 2016.This is a great place to invest in right now, both with respect to the near term and the longer term. While valuations do appear rich, there are indications that the momentum will continue.Rising demand for information, analytics solution and risk mitigation, and increasing volume of data from private and government organizations should support growth of the industry in the long run. A strong U.S. economy, reduced tax rates, robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity and higher government spending should support growth in near to mid-term.So while the more cautious of us might wait for a better entry point, here are some stock picks for the rest. (FDS): The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 25.3% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year EPS has risen 0.7% in the past 60 days.(VRSK): The Zacks Rank #2 stock has gained 31.5% over the past year.

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $111.00, changing hands for $111.57/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $105.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $123.00. The standard deviation is $6.548.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $111.00/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $111.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

arren Buffett's the most famous buy-and-hold investor on the planet, so if his company,  (NYSE: BRK-B) (NYSE: BRK-A) , is selling a stock in its portfolio, you might want to consider selling it, too.Fortunately, Berkshire Hathaway reveals which stocks the Oracle of Omaha is selling in its quarterly 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company's latest filing shows he sold shares in  (NASDAQ: VRSK) ,  (NYSE: IBM) , and  (NYSE: PSX) . Is it time for these stocks to exit your portfolio, too?When Verisk went public in 2009, Warren Buffett was the only owner not to  . Clearly, he believed that the long-term opportunity associated with crunching actuarial data for insurers was undervalued in the IPO, but he might not think that anymore.Image source: The Motley Fool.In 2018's first quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake in Verisk by 82%, leaving it with 284,778 shares worth only about $30.5 million, as of this writing. That's an ant-sized position for Berkshire Hathaway, which manages an equity portfolio that's valued at nearly $200 billion.Warren Buffett isn't saying why he sold so many of his Verisk shares last quarter, but you can hardly blame him for ringing the register. Verisk's stock finished the first quarter above $100, which is miles higher than the $22 fetched in its IPO.Berkshire Hathaway's relationship with Verisk was a long one. Alongside other property and casualty companies, Berkshire Hathaway founded Verisk in the 1970s to combine data to reduce the risk of unexpected insurance claims and costs.Verisk has grown substantially over the years. Its customers are responsible for about 85% of all the property and casualty insurance written, and acquisitions have expanded it into other markets, including energy and finance.Excluding tailwinds from acquisitions, organic revenue growth clocked in at a healthy 7% year over year in Q1 2018. That's far from worrisome, but Buffett may have decided that Verisk's changing business model makes the company less intriguing. As of Q1, insurance accounted for only 72% of Verisk's revenue, and given that about 20% of sales are now coming from the volatile energy sector, pocketing his profit may have become too irresistible.Once upon a time, IBM was one of Warren Buffett's top stock picks. Not anymore. He's soured on Big Blue's plans to transform itself from a legacy networking company into a nimble cloud-based solutions company. As a result, he's been selling IBM stock for over a year, and in Q1 2018, it vanished entirely from Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.In the past, Warren Buffett's said he avoids technology stocks because their competitive advantages are often fleeting, and identifying winners early enough to buy them at a reasonable price is difficult. A value investor, Buffett favors companies with deep  protecting their business model that he can buy on sale.Technology stocks are rarely cheap based on key valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings ratios, and when they are cheap, it's often because competitors are threatening their core business.That's certainly been the case for IBM. It once dominated the enterprise hardware and software market, but increasingly, companies are embracing cloud and hybrid platforms that don't cost as much money up front and that are more easily upgraded. IBM has responded to the change by entering these high-growth markets -- but that space is fiercely competitive, and challenges from  's AWS,  , and others have crimped its progress.As a result, the additional sales it generates from these fast-growing markets hasn't offset declining demand for its other products, causing a steady decline in its sales and profitability.Given the risk of IBM's turnaround taking longer than planned (or failing altogether), Buffett sold 64.5 million IBM shares between Q1 2017 and Q1 2018, including his final 2 million shares last quarter.Image source: Getty Images.Phillips 66 has been a staple in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio since 2012. But its impact on Warren Buffett's portfolio will be smaller following the sale of 35 million shares in the oil and gas transport, storage, refining, and marketing company last quarter.Although Warren Buffett sold a considerable chunk of his Phillips 66 holding in Q1, he doesn't appear to have plans to sell his remaining 46 million shares. Phillips 66 bought the shares directly from Berkshire Hathaway as part of its buyback program, while Buffett's decision to sell was driven by a desire to cut his ownership below 10% to reduce regulatory burdens, not because of worry over the company's business outlook. Berkshire Hathaway owned about 16% of Phillips 66 prior to 2018 and currently owns about 9.8% of the company.In exchange for his 35 million shares, Buffett received about $3.3 billion, or $93.73 per share. That price may have netted him  , according to number-crunching by fellow Fool Jason Hall.Admittedly, there's no guarantee Warren Buffett will hold his remaining Phillips 66 stock. Still, the company's business continues to hum along nicely, and absent any deterioration in commodities markets or its performance, I think he'll be content to hold on to his remaining shares for a while.Phillips 66 is among the few energy stocks that continued posting profits during the steep decline in  that began in 2014. Now that commodity prices are climbing again, its income is accelerating. For instance, its adjusted earnings skyrocketed to $512 million in Q1 2018 from $294 million in Q1 2017. data by  .With new pipeline projects that can boost revenue coming on line and increasing margins, Phillips 66 should be able to continue buying back shares and increasing its dividend. Since 2012, it has returned over $20 billion to shareholders via dividends, share repurchases, and share exchanges; undeniably, Warren Buffett has benefited significantly from that track record.Because a growing global population and expanding economic growth support Phillips 66's profitability, and Warren Buffett doesn't appear in a hurry to sell his remaining stake, this could be the best stock of the three to hold on to in your portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now… and Phillips 66 wasn't one of them!

The improvement was primarily driven by strength in the company's catastrophe modeling services and underwriting solutions.

The year-over-year organic constant currency increase was primarily driven by increased salaries and benefits associated with innovation and business growth.Verisk Analytics exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents balance of $149.8 million, up from $142.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

 yesterday announced the acquisition of U.K.-based claims management and insurance company, Validus-IVC but did not reveal the amount it paid for the same.The buyout will see the integration of Validus-IVC's subrogation platform with Verisk's data-driven claims solution set. The combined entity is expected to offer an improved and automated claims settlement process that lowers expenses and increases claims outcome consistency with the help of improved analytical tools.A glimpse at Verisk's price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past year. Shares have returned 33.1%, significantly outperforming the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and  's rally of 13.8% and 28.2%, respectively.The acquisition is expected to expand Verisk's claims solutions, thereby boosting its Insurance segment. In first-quarter 2018, the Insurance segment contributed the largest chunk (around 71%) to Verisk's total revenues. Revenues from this segment were $412.6 million, up 12.5% year over year on a reported basis and 8.7% on an organic constant-currency basis.Revenues from Claims accounted for almost 32% of the Insurance segment's total revenues in first-quarter 2018. Claims revenues were $132 million, up 16.1% on a reported basis and 12.6% on an organic constant-currency basis in the quarter.Additionally, we believe that Validus-IVC, which has offices in Norwich and Bath, will strengthen Verisk's position in the U.K. insurance market.Acquisitions have been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. Internally, it is focused on evaluating and integrating acquisitions that are valuable for its shareholders.From 2015-2017, Verisk completed 21 acquisitions. In early 2018, the company acquired two companies - Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5.

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $106.75, changing hands for $107.12/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $92.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $118.00. The standard deviation is $7.91.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $106.75/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $106.75 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:

 will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, after the bell.We expect the company's results to be driven by strong organic growth, acquisitions and benefits from U.S. tax reforms.In a year's time, shares of Verisk Analytics have gained 28.2%, outperforming the  's 24.7% rally.Here are the expectations in detail.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $565 million, reflecting an increase of 12.3% when compared with the year-ago quarter's actual figure. This upside is likely to be driven by strength across the company's two segments - Decision Analytics and Risk Assessment. In the last reported quarter, total revenues improved 12.7% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues at the Decision Analytics segment are expected to be driven by increase insurance, energy and specialized markets as well as financial services category revenues. While the insurance category is witnessing growth in repair cost estimating, claims analytics solutions and underwriting solutions, the energy category is banking on momentum in subscription business. The financial services category rides high on its analytical data warehousing products, media effectiveness solutions and share of wallet model algorithms.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Decision Analytics segment revenues is pegged at $365 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16.6%. In the fourth quarter, revenues from this segment increased 16% year over year.Risk Assessment revenues are likely to be driven by annual effective growth in 2017 invoices, new solutions in industry-standard insurance programs and increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenues.

ast year, for the first time this decade, the solar industry installed fewer megawatts than it did in the year before. According to  , 10,608 MW of solar power generation was installed in 2017 -- enough to power 1.74 million homes -- but down significantly from 15,128 MW in 2016.The decline was driven by a number of factors from national policy to company-specific challenges, some of which may impact the industry for the next few years. But there are already some bright spots emerging that solar investors will want to keep an eye on.Image source: .Image source:  .You can see in the chart above that the outlier in the long-term solar installation trendline is 2016, not 2017. That was in large part because 2016 was originally going to be the final year of the solar investment tax credit (ITC), a subsidy that allows project owners to get a 30% tax credit based on an installations' value. It's a subsidy the industry relies on to make solar projects economical, so when it was set to expire there was a rush to build solar projects.The  , but that didn't stop installations from falling off a cliff in 2017. Large solar projects take years of planning, so the extension was too late to slow the rush of projects being built to hit the old 2016 deadline.In short, there was a (well-planned) mad rush to build utility-scale solar projects in the U.S. in 2016, and 2017 was a natural retreat from that surge. That explains the utility-scale solar decline you see above, which accounts for most of the decline year over year. But residential and commercial solar could be bright spots, and as investors, that's where I think there are some interesting opportunities.Image source: Getty Images.Residential solar installations took a step backward in 2017, declining by 16% to 2,227 MW. It was the first time this decade that residential solar installations had fallen, but digging into the numbers the decline isn't all that surprising. The biggest drop in installations came in California, which accounted for half of the decline. The state is ending traditional net metering for rooftop solar (where solar customers would only pay for the net energy they use) and moving to time-of-use (TOU) rates, which are less favorable to solar homeowners. For example, rates are generally lower mid-day when the sun is out and higher in the evening when the sun is going down. The effect is lower compensation for the electricity sent to the grid, making it harder to justify rooftop solar. But that's not the only reason residential solar declined.In 2016, it became clear that the most interested customers had already bought in, so sales and marketing costs were starting to rise to unsustainable levels. The three biggest residential solar installers in the country --  (NASDAQ: TSLA) ,  (NASDAQ: RUN) , and  (NYSE: VSLR) -- all talked about focusing more on profitability and potentially foregoing growth for profits. That's exactly what we saw in 2017.Tesla took the biggest step backward,  , down 57% from its peak in Q2 2016. Tesla is lowering sales costs by eliminating most of its traditional door-to-door sales teams, but it's also just shrinking its solar ambitions. You can't grow a solar company by shrinking staff, which is exactly what Tesla is doing.Vivint Solar's installations fell 17.3% to 183.8 MW in 2017 as the company contracted the number of markets it served and focused on higher-value customers. The strategy appears to be working with revenue up 98% in 2017 to $268.0 million and gross profit swinging from a $38.8 million loss in 2016 to a $37.7 million profit in 2017. Sometimes smaller is better in solar energy.Interestingly, Sunrun was the one growth story among installers, increasing deployments by 15% to 323.3 MW in 2017 and taking over the top market share position from Tesla. Sunrun benefited from Tesla and Vivint Solar shrinking, allowing it to leverage its network of third-party installers to grow. Sunrun builds some of the solar systems it counts as deployments but doesn't install all of them. Rather it offers financing and design tools to regional installers who were eager to grow their businesses in 2017. That's where the company's growth came from.In residential solar, there are some bright spots despite the decline in installations in 2017. Vivint Solar is making more money than it did a year ago and Sunrun is growing on the back of regional installers it partners with. Amid the industry's decline, these two companies look like they're building winning strategies.Utility and residential solar had a tough time in 2017, but one segment that had a great year is commercial solar. These are solar installations on rooftops of warehouses, big-box retailers, or even small community solar developments that may be near your neighborhood. According to GTM Research, commercial solar installations jumped 28% in 2017 to 2,147 MW and with corporate interest in renewable energy growing, I see no sign of the momentum slowing down.The one company to watch in commercial solar is  (NASDAQ: SPWR) , who holds the #1 market share position and offers a flexible set of solutions for customers from rooftop solar to carports and ground mounted solutions. SunPower doesn't break out U.S.-only commercial sales, but globally it sold 426 MW of commercial solar products in 2017, bigger than both Sunrun and Vivint Solar's residential businesses. The challenge is that gross margin for the year was just 9.7% in the commercial segment, well below management's target of mid-teen margins. If SunPower can increase profitability on its #1 market share position in commercial solar this could be a great business long-term, but it has yet to live up to its financial promise.While 2017 was a down year for solar, the pipeline is filling back up with big projects. GTM Research says the contracted pipeline of utility-scale solar projects is 16,883 MW with another 26,700 MW announced and pre-contract. Those won't all be built this year, but growth should return to the large-scale solar industry in time. On a company level we're seeing evidence that momentum is returning to the utility market.  , which only serves the utility-scale market, shipped just 2.7 GW of solar panels in 2017, but it booked 7.7 GW of future sales, indicating that growth will return to utility-scale solar in coming years.Where I think investors should expect the best company performance in 2018 is residential and commercial solar. Vivint Solar and Sunrun are increasing margins and taking market share in residential solar, which is a positive sign for their businesses long-term. Growth isn't the metric I would look for to define success this year, but I would look at gross margins and even net income improvement as signs these companies are on solid footing in residential solar.SunPower is a complex company that produces utility-scale solutions and offers residential products, but where it has the most potential is providing solar to businesses and governments around the world. If it can expand commercial segment gross margins into the mid-teens and continue to ride the wave of growth in commercial solar installations it could allow the company to put massive losses the last two years behind it and return to profitability. If that happens, the company's stock could be a big winner for investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ne constant in the solar industry over the last 30 years has been the falling cost of solar panels. Core raw materials like silicon have become cheaper, manufacturing technology has made making panels faster and more efficient, and scale has helped lower costs. In almost every part of the value chain costs have been trending lower for decades. But in 2017, the trend reversed itself in the U.S.According to GTM Research, solar panel prices jumped nearly 25% in 2017 and global prices increased as well. There were a few factors that drove higher pricing, and if the trends continue, it could impact a wide range of solar companies in 2018.Image source: Getty Images.The table below shows the rising cost of polysilicon (raw material), slices of silicon called wafers, solar cells, and ultimately an assembly of cells that make up solar modules, according to GTM Research. The rock-bottom prices in late 2016 and early 2017 reversed course in the second half of the year as installers rushed to buy solar panels.Image source: .Image source:  .Supply and demand account for some of the increase in module prices, which allowed  (NASDAQ: FSLR) and  (NASDAQ: SPWR) to keep manufacturing plants running at full speed all year. As a result, margins and earnings  in 2017.First Solar and SunPower also have some company-specific tailwinds that will help them in 2018 as well. First Solar is the biggest solar manufacturer in the U.S., which gives it a unique position of avoiding the 30% tariff on solar imports implemented earlier this year. Until competitors build U.S. manufacturing (something they  ), the company should have a price advantage and will likely see strong margins as a result.SunPower is a high-efficiency solar manufacturer, so it sells most solar panels into residential and commercial markets, which are less price sensitive to the solar panel itself. Rather, they want to squeeze more power from limited roof space. That makes SunPower's product attractive, especially as commodity solar panel prices rise. Referrning to margins on residential installations, CFO Charles Boynton said in the most recent conference call that ""longer term, I think we still continue to believe it should be low-20%s to mid-20%s, and in some cases, low-30%s"" and in commercial solar margins in the ""low-teens to high teens"" are expected. That's better than most of the industry because of SunPower's superior technology.As we think about how higher solar panel prices impact the industry, we're not seeing benefits spread evenly. I outlined why First Solar and SunPower had better years than expected, but some manufacturers are seeing higher input costs squeezing margins. You can see below that gross margins for  (NYSE: JKS) ,  (NASDAQ: JASO) , and  (NASDAQ: HQCL) were all down in 2017, despite the rising panel price trends. data by  .Each of these manufacturers produces only some of the polysilicon in their solar panels. Hanwha Q-Cells had an estimated capacity of just 1.6 GW for polysilicon in Q4 2017 compared to 4.3 GW of solar panel capacity. JinkoSolar ended the year with 8 GW of panel capacity but bought most of its polysilicon and a large portion of solar cells as well. As a result, costs increased slightly late in the year and margins fell.These manufacturers give a glimpse of what the commodity solar panel market looks like given their large panel capacity. Even when prices are strong, it's tough to make money in solar manufacturing.Demand and pricing for solar panels appear to be strong even into 2018, leaving very little excess supply in the market, especially from top-tier manufacturers. But that doesn't necessarily mean everyone will have a profitable year.In the U.S., First Solar is the only major manufacturer who is going to completely avoid tariffs, leaving the company with a windfall of profits over the next few years. But Asian manufacturers and U.S. based SunPower, who manufactures solar cells in Asia, will be hit by higher costs. Even if they import panels to the U.S. the margins may not be attractive to investors.High polysilicon prices will also hurt margins for solar manufacturers who don't have enough capacity in-house. Even if solar panel prices remain elevated in 2018, margins may not improve because raw material costs are negating the higher price.Solar panel prices will swing based on supply and demand and technology changes, but cost drops of 30% or more in a single year may be a thing of the past. For companies with a unique geographic advantage, like First Solar, or a technology advantage, like SunPower, the end of falling prices may leave them with a competitive advantage over commodity suppliers who didn't see higher profits despite higher prices in 2017.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the May 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new May 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $98.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $103.81/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 75%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $103.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.94% if the stock gets called away at the May 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

" recently inked an agreement to acquire Kensho Technologies Inc. for approximately $550 million in a combination of cash and stock, to boost its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and thwart competition. The transaction is likely to be completed by early second-quarter 2018, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions and other regulatory approvals.Based in Cambridge, MA, Kensho is a premier provider of next-generation AI, analytics, machine learning and data visualization systems to leading investment firms and banks in the Wall Street as well as the National Security community. This Harvard Square start-up firm has created a niche market for itself since its inception in 2013 by developing and deploying scalable AI systems to solve some of the hardest analytical problems across the globe.The buyout will facilitate S&P Global to improve its core operations by applying actionable insights through the use of AI solutions and sophisticated algorithms, thereby augmenting its efficacy. On the other hand, the transaction will enable Kensho to leverage S&P Global's deep data sets, global-scale analytics platforms, essential benchmarks and strong leadership team to better serve clients while retaining the independent brand identity.The acquisition is the second of its kind. The first was S&P Global's buyout of a New York-based data analytics private company, Panjiva Inc. in February. Panjiva - a leader in machine learning and data analytics - provides deep, differentiated, sector-relevant insights on global supply chains, leveraging data science and technology to make sense of large, unstructured datasets. It offers customers macro data covering 95% of global trade flows and transactional data covering 35% of the same. S&P Global expects Panjiva to enhance its  Intelligence's data and analytical offerings for diverse customers throughout the world, generating higher top-line growth. With such opportune acquisitions, S&P Global has outperformed the  in the last six months with an average return of 24.2% compared with a gain of 13% for the latter.S&P Global expects the Kensho acquisition to be dilutive to its GAAP earnings for 2018 and has accordingly revised its earlier guidance. It currently expects GAAP earnings in the range of $7.95-$8.10 per share, down from earlier expectations of $8.15-$8.30. However, adjusted earnings' guidance is reiterated at $8.45-$8.60 per share.S&P Global carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks worth considering in the industry include TransUnion  , Verisk Analytics, Inc.  and IHS Markit Ltd.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

It exceeded estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5.2%.Verisk has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 11%. It exceeded estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.2%.IHS Markit has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 11.6%.

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $104.83, changing hands for $105.24/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $82.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $118.00. The standard deviation is $10.675.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $104.83/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $104.83 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

"n Feb 12, we issued an updated research report on business services provider,  .Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze troves of data, Verisk draws on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide predictive analytics and decision support solutions that are integrated into customer workflows. These facilitate its customers to take informed decisions with greater precision, efficiency and discipline about various risks involved in the businesses. In order to create long-term value for its clients, the company has extended its scalable data and analytic solutions by steadily putting resources into overseas markets. The scalability of its products has further led to highly cash-generative businesses characterized by high net margins and relatively low capital intensity.Verisk offers advanced technologies to capture and interpret imagery, telemetry data, sensory data and other emergent data sets in real time and at scale. At the same time, it provides visualization and consumability with emphasis on geo-location to predict weather patterns in advance. Multivariate regression trees and algorithms to estimate event likelihood and cohort belonging along with simulated Monte Carlo experiments for highly coupled nonlinear systems with wide variability and high underlying betas remain its forte. Such a deep technical prowess for analytics and Big Data provide an unrivalled edge over its competitors. Verisk has outperformed the  in the last six months with an average return of 15.8% compared with a gain of 9.7% for the latter.Moreover, Verisk aims to create long-term value through organic growth and better returns on invested capital. The company continuously seeks to expand its portfolio by leveraging its deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new, proprietary data sets and predictive analytics by working with its customers to understand their evolving needs. Verisk recorded an average organic revenue growth rate of about 8% over the past 10 years.However, Verisk is susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities, computer networks and databases, resulting in a loss of its credibility and/or customers. Data theft and misuse by third-party contractors could also lead to loss of businesses and pose a significant threat. The company is also vulnerable to high volatility related to continued end-market headwinds affecting its environmental health and safety solutions.Nevertheless, we expect Verisk to witness higher revenues in the future and remain impressed by its focused growth initiatives. Verisk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other noteworthy stocks in the industry include Exponent, Inc.  , S&P Global Inc.  and Intertek Group plc  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

" is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 14. The company's Integrated Agency Networks (""IAN"") segment, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues, is anticipated to generate higher revenues in the quarter.Whether this will lead to higher earnings remains to be seen.Interpublic is poised to grow on the back of its strong digital capabilities, diversified business model and extensive geographic presence. The company is anticipated to achieve targeted levels in the quarter based on diversification across emerging regions along with collaboration and integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in key global markets are likely to translate into higher revenues.The Group's best-in-industry talent and tools are expected to offer optimal and affordable solutions, thus rendering an edge over its peers. The company's cost-cutting efforts, continuous margin improvement, stronger balance sheet and better capital structure are anticipated to aid bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the quarter's Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the IAN segment is pegged at $1,874 million compared with $1,866 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Constituency Management Group segment are anticipated to be $401 million compared with reported revenues of $399 million in the prior-year quarter. Revenues from the domestic markets are likely to maintain a flat trajectory at $1,255 million, while that from the international markets are expected to be $1,028 million compared with $1,006 million reported in the year-earlier quarter.However, the company forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Agencies and media services compete with other agencies and creative or media services providers to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. These are likely to pose challenges to its prospects.Furthermore, constrained marketing budgets from big clients are anticipated to slow down organic growth and lead to account loss for Interpublic, which may hamper its financial position going forward. This apart, the company's exposure to foreign currency translation impacts might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Interpublic this time around.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the September 21st expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new September 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $83.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $98.76/share today.Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 14% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 92%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.29% return on the cash commitment, or 1.98% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $98.76/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.13% if the stock gets called away at the September 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

nvestors considering a purchase of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $99.22/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.7% return against the $95 commitment, or a 5.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $95 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisk Analytics Inc sees its shares decline 4.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $91.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.50 from $95), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $95 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $95 strike for the 5.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Verisk Analytics Inc (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $99.22) to be 15%.

"Shutterstock photoThe most recent short interest data was recently released for the 12/29/2017 settlement date, and Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 5.88 ""days to cover"" versus the median component at 4.65. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the ""days to cover"" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then divided by the average daily volume, to express the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.In the case of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK), the total short interest at the 12/29/2017 settlement date was 4,016,080 shares, which compares to the average daily trading volume of just 682,837 shares, for a ""days to cover"" ratio of 5.88.When short sellers eventually cover their positions, by definition there must be buying activity because a share that is currently sold short must be purchased to be covered. At the present levels of short interest, if from this point forward every single VRSK share traded represented a short position being closed, then at the average daily volume of 682,837 shares it would only be during the 6th trading day that every short position would be closed.So it would stand to reason that should some unexpectedly good news come out, and short sellers did not have 6 days of patience but instead wanted to cover their short positions very suddenly, that situation could result in sending the stock higher until the higher price produces enough sellers to generate the necessary volume to close out those positions quickly.Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) has something relatively rare for a stock with this much short interest, that being insiders taking the other side of the trade. Looking back over the trailing six month period, VRSK has seen 3 different instances of insider buying, as summarized by the table below:
  
Below is a chart showing the ""days to cover"" for VRSK over time:And looking at the chart below, VRSK's low point in its 52 week range is $75.802 per share, with $100.54 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $97.29.In recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) were changing hands at $97.29/share.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@VRSK: Insiders vs. Shorts@2018-02-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vrsk-insiders-vs-shorts-2018-02-05

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $87.60, changing hands for $89.88/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $78.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $95.00. The standard deviation is $6.077.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $87.60/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $87.60 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Verisk Analytics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for VRSK in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 79 cents per share for VRSK, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for VRSK, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.29% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that VRSK has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Verisk Analytics and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

he U.S. GDP is likely to grow around 1.5% in the third quarter, a fall from 2.1% in the prior quarter, mainly due to the devastating hurricanes - Harvey and Irma. Despite the setbacks, the overall economic sentiment remained fairly bullish buoyed by some sweeping policy changes proposed by President Donald Trump, which are likely to take effect in the ensuing quarters.The investor-friendly policies including a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years, overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and regulatory rollbacks, are likely to spur higher consumer spending. They are also expected to create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. The GDP is expected to pick up pace in the fourth quarter and grow at an annualized rate of 2.6% as Trump's policies gradually take center stage, tempered slightly by the geopolitical situations across the globe.U.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance and reached a 13-year high in September as the manufacturing index measured by the Institute for Supply Management recorded 60.8% - the highest since May 2004. This also serves as a precursor to the solid economic growth expected in the near future.On an average, there were 172,000 job additions per month till September, when the economy lost 33,000 net jobs due to natural calamities. However, the unemployment rate fell to a 16-month low to 4.2% in September due to higher participation rate of 63.1% as more people looked for work, a clear indication that the economy is improving.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence strongly held its fort. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index decreased slightly to 119.8 in September from 120.4 in August due to the storms, signifying optimism about the U.S. economy.As the companies take stock of the situation and deliberate on their future course of action, let's take a look at how the third-quarter earnings are shaping up so far for the business services sector.About 16.7% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector reported their earnings results through Oct 18, 2017. With a 'beat ratio' of 100%, total earnings for these companies are up 11.6% year over year. Revenues increased 5.8% from the year-ago period, with a 'beat ratio' of 100%.The entire Business Services sector is expected to perform slightly lower than the overall index. The earnings growth expectation for the sector is 0.8% versus 3% for the S&P 500. (Read:  ).The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects of job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the forecast, it might be a good idea to zero in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise should help these stocks outperform in the near term.The Business Services sector covers an array of services including marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the June 2018 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 232 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new June 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $73.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $84.76/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 81%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.60% return on the cash commitment, or 2.52% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.35. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $84.76/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.95% if the stock gets called away at the June 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.77% boost of extra return to the investor, or 4.36% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 20%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 17%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $84.76) to be 14%.

Trash collection and disposal probably isn't the most exciting industry to invest in, but when you're looking for stocks that can be held for decade-plus durations, ""boring"" companies that pay dividends often make for great portfolio additions. As America's largest garbage hauler, Waste Management has the type of boring, dependable business that likely will make its stock a treasure for long-term investors.With regard to returned income, the company boasts a solid 2.2% yield that's comfortably above the  's 1.9% yield and has raised its payout annually for 14 years running.

However, its hold on its markets and reliable income generation do a lot to offset those concerns, and the company is also steadily growing through  that are strengthening its industry dominance.With nearly guaranteed demand for its services, little in the way of competition, and income generation, Waste Management is a safe stock that you can hold to 2030 and beyond. U.S. midstream oil and gas partnership Magellan Midstream Partners is unlikely to be an exciting investment between now and 2030. But if history is any guide, it's a company you can safely own while expecting regular distribution increases along the way.For starters, Magellan's business is largely fee based. That means that oil and  are less important than demand for these key global feedstocks to Magellan's business. As long as the world is still using oil and natural gas for everything from gasoline to electric power to chemicals, Magellan's assets will have customers.Then there's the fact that Magellan is conservatively financed, with debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) below that of even  .

Management is always on the lookout for growth opportunities, too. Right now, it has plans for around $1 billion in spending. But there's another $500 million on the drawing board that could soon get the green light. That means Magellan should continue to grow its business and, in turn, its distribution over time at a slow and steady rate.Magellan is unlikely to excite you, but it won't likely keep you up at night, either. It'll just keep rewarding you for owning it while you collect the over 5.2% distribution yield, backed by regular distribution increases. Predicting what the world is going to look like in 2030 is difficult, if not impossible, but I'm fairly certain that the insurance industry will still be around. If true, then insurers everywhere still will be willing to pay up to get their hands on tools and data that allow them to measure and manage risk. That's why I believe that Verisk Analytics is a company that can  .What sets Verisk apart from other data providers is that it was founded by a consortium of insurance companies way back in 1971. At the time, the leading insurers of the day decided to pool their data together so they could more effectively price their policies. This fact provided Verisk with a unique database that isn't available anywhere else.Fast forward to today, and all different kinds of companies look to Verisk for risk-management solutions. What's more, those customers pay Verisk a hefty subscription fee in order to gain access to the company's tools and data. This makes its financial statements highly predictable.In addition, since it doesn't cost the company much to add one more customer to its platform, Verisk's profits tend to grow at a much faster rate than revenue. data by Between Verisk's price increases, acquisitions, and continued margin improvement, I think the odds are very favorable that the company's revenue and profits will continue to grow at a robust rate from here.

t has been more than a month since the last earnings report for  . Shares have lost about 5.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Verisk reported solid second-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in earnings from continuing operations. Revenues also increased from the prior-year quarter.Net income from continuing operations improved to $121.0 million from $106.8 million in the year-earlier quarter primarily driven by top-line growth. On a per share basis, net income from continuing operations increased to $0.72 from $0.62 in the year-earlier quarter.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations were up 12.3% year over year to $0.82 per share and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.05.Total revenue for the reported quarter improved to $523.2 million from $498.3 million in the prior-year period due to modest organic growth at constant currency basis, led by solid insurance business. Revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $520 million. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) from continuing operations for the quarter improved 3.7% year over year to $254.1 million.Decision Analytics segment's revenues from continuing operations increased 4.2% year over year to $330.6 million and accounted for 63.2% of total revenue. Energy and Specialized Markets category revenues declined 0.7% year over year to $110.3 million, owing to end-market headwinds and lower revenues in environmental health and safety solutions. Insurance category revenues increased 8.8% to $191.0 million on solid performance by underwriting solutions, catastrophe modeling solutions and claims analytics. Financial Services category revenues were down to $29.3 million from $30.6 million in the prior-year period due to completed contracts.Risk Assessment segment's revenues grew 6.4% to $192.6 million, accounting for 36.8% of total revenue. Property-specific rating and underwriting information revenues improved 4.7% to $43.8 million, driven by an increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenues. Industry-standard insurance programs revenues were up 6.9% to $145.6 million, primarily attributable to growth in new solutions.During the quarter, Verisk acquired seven premier aerial imagery firms to support its Geomni business. The strategic acquisitions are likely to create a proprietary database of property information derived from multi-tier, multi-spectral images in order to unlock a large addressable market. Consequently, Verisk aims to leverage its expertise in computer-vision-based imagery processing and large-scale data management to meet the increasing needs of property/casualty insurance with the required frequency, resolution and coverage across the U.S. We expect the acquisitions to be accretive to the company's earnings in the near future.At the end of the quarter, Verisk had about $140.7 million in cash and cash equivalents with long-term debt of $2,276.6 million. Net cash generated from operating activities for the first half of 2017 was $429.8 million compared with $385.1 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the first six months of 2017 increased 14.5% year over year to $357.3 million.Verisk repurchased 2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $79.73 per share for $156 million. At the quarter end, the company had $376 million worth of shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization.Verisk continues to deliver outstanding data analytics solutions to its customers across its core verticals of insurance, natural resources and financial services. The company's ability to generate strong cash enables it to meet its deleveraging objectives and helps it invest on behalf of its shareholders.Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, Verisk Analytics' stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Analysts Expect 10% Upside For The Holdings of SPXT@2017-08-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-expect-10-upside-holdings-spxt-2017-08-29
ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (Symbol: SPLV) where we have detected an approximate $79.6 million dollar inflow -- that's a 1.1% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 152,900,000 to 154,650,000). Among the largest underlying components of SPLV, in trading today Republic Services Inc (Symbol: RSG) is down about 0.1%, Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) is up about 0.1%, and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (Symbol: EXPD) is lower by about 0.1%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of SPLV, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SPLV's low point in its 52 week range is $39.61 per share, with $45.69 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $45.46. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Inflow Detected - SPLV, RSG, VRSK, EXPD@2017-08-04@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-inflow-detected-splv-rsg-vrsk-expd-2017-08-04
Shutterstock photoLegendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.9, after changing hands as low as $80.56 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 39.8. A bullish investor could look at VRSK's 28.9 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of VRSK shares:    Looking at the chart above, VRSK's low point in its 52 week range is $75.60 per share, with $88.17 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $80.58.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, VRSK makes up 1.53% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading lower by about 1.4% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Oversold Conditions For Verisk Analytics (VRSK)@2017-08-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/oversold-conditions-verisk-analytics-vrsk-2017-08-10

"usiness information services firm  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after market close on Aug 1. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, Verisk beat earnings estimates twice, delivering an average positive surprise of 1.71%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.During the quarter, Verisk acquired MAKE, a leading research and advisory business specializing in wind power. Per the deal, MAKE became part of Verisk's operating unit, Wood Mackenzie. This acquisition will enhance the company's offerings to its existing clients and help it become the leading market analysis and advisory firm. The company expects this acquisition to be accretive in the quarter to be reported.Also, Verisk's business arm, ISO signed a strategic alliance with IDP, Inc., for expanding the ISO Preferred Data Partnership program. Under the Preferred Data Partnership program, ISO accumulates and refines raw policy data straight from insurers. The collected data is used to form reports that are submitted to the regulatory authorities across the U.S. The two companies would thereby be converting the accumulated native data into valuable information and provide regulatory as well as statistical reports to the regulatory authorities, on behalf of the insurers (for both special data calls and conventional reporting requisites). This will help boost the company's revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, a significant portion of the company's revenues is generated from operations outside the U.S. With modest revenues coming from the U.K., Verisk is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering the productivity of the company. These undermine its long-term growth potential to some extent.Verisk's business model is centered on large troves of data. Consequently, the company is susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities, computer networks and databases, resulting in a loss of its credibility and/or customers. Data theft and misuse by third-party contractors could also lead to loss of businesses and jeopardize the fundamental existence of the company.Despite the inherent strengths, our proven model does not conclusively show that Verisk is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .) Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 77 cents. So, the difference - the Earnings ESP - is 0.00%. |  : Verisk carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Crestwood Equity Partners LP  , with an Earnings ESP of +160.00%, and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see American Railcar Industries, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +8.07%, and a Zacks Rank #2.Apple Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.27%, and a Zacks Rank #3.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

"'m a firm believer that the best way to become wealthy is to buy great companies and hold them tenaciously. For that reason, when I think I've found a great business, I mentally add it to my ""never sell"" list.So what are some stocks that I plan on keeping forever? Here's why I consider  (NASDAQ: VRSK) ,  (NASDAQ: MKTX) , and  (NYSE: MA) to be core holdings in my portfolio.Image source: Getty Images.Insurance providers are keenly aware that it is nearly impossible to profitably price a policy without having access to high-quality information. That's why they are happy to pay up in order to get their hands on Verisk Analytics' treasure trove of historical data.Verisk's database is so desirable because it was created by a number of leading insurance providers way back in 1971. At the time, those same insurers got together to share their information with one another in an effort to better predict losses and drive higher profitability.Fast-forward to today and Verisk has evolved to become the go-to consultant on any decision that involves risk. The company's platform is capable of collecting and analyzing information from  of different records in a flash. That allows Verisk to provide its customers with unique insights related to underwriting, economic forecasts, claims, weather events, and more.What I love about its business model is that Verisk has become deeply ingrained in its customers' daily operating practices. As a result, its revenue is largely recurring and the company is able to pass along regular price increases for its services. What's more, Verisk has a history of buying other information providers in an effort to expand into new industries. When combined, these factors help Verisk to post steady growth on its top and bottom lines over time. . Data by  .Moving forward, I think that investors can expect more of the same as the company continues to deepen its relationship with its current customers and broadens its reach into new markets. That should drive increased profitability down the road, which is why this is one stock that I plan on holding for the long term.I've been buying and selling stocks online for nearly two decades, so I was shocked to learn that the bulk of bond trading still occurs over email or the phone. Thankfully, MarketAxess Holdings is on a mission to allow bond traders to join the rest of the world in the 21st century. The company's online platform makes it easy for bond traders to buy, sell, or research a variety of fixed-income securities. What's more, MarketAxess' system also greatly increases transparency, liquidity, and enables rapid execution. What's not to like?Given the advantages, perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise to learn that trading firms are signing up in droves. At the end of 2011, MarketAxess' client count stood around 700. This figure has climbed to around 1,200 today and it continues to rise with each passing quarter.With so many clients on its platform, MarketAxess has become the lead husky in this market niche. This provides the company with a huge advantage over rivals since bond buyers will naturally be attracted to the platform with the most sellers. The same dynamic is also true for sellers, which positions the company well for continued growth.Looking ahead, I think that it is highly likely that its platform will continue to thrive as more and more traders realize the benefits of moving online. With  left to conquer, MarketAxess looks well positioned to thrive over the long term.I've been paying for life's necessities with debit and credit cards for years. I greatly favor them over cash or check because the process is seamless and I get to earn rewards with each purchase. I also like being able to review all of my transactions online and I also like the security that cards provide.All of these advantages have helped credit cards to become ubiquitous in the developed world. This has been a boon for electronic payment processors like Mastercard since it holds a vital role in connecting millions of merchants, customers, and financial institutions together. In exchange for providing this service, Mastercard gets to keep a small fee on each transaction that occurs on its network. With trillions of dollars being processed in the company's network each year, those fees are expected to help Mastercard pull in more than $12 billion in annual revenue this year.While the big revenue number is great, what attracts me most to Mastercard's stock is that it costs the company next to nothing to process additional volume. This allows Mastercard's profit margins to consistently get better over time. When adding in the company's habit of buying back stock, Mastercard's EPS has been able to grow at a far faster rate than revenue over the long term. . Data by  .Going forward, I think the company can continue to execute because 85% of global transactions still occur using cash or check. As networks continue to penetrate the developing world, I'm confident that more consumers will make the switch to electronic payment methods. That should allow Mastercard's bottom line to continue to expand at  rates for years to come, which is why I could see myself remaining a shareholder indefinitely.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market. (In fact, the newsletter they run,  has tripled the market!*)Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading today, for the March 2018 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 235 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new March 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $81.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $86.74/share today.Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.12% return on the cash commitment, or 6.40% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $86.74/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.68% if the stock gets called away at the March 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.92% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.09% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 19%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 18%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $86.74) to be 15%.

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $84.79, changing hands for $85.44/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $74.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $95.00. The standard deviation is $6.746.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $84.79/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $84.79 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 5.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Verisk reported sedate first-quarter 2017 results on muted industry growth and related headwinds. Net income from continuing operations decreased to $108.8 million from $109.7 million in the year-earlier quarter on higher operating expenses. On a per share basis, net income from continuing operations remained flat at $0.64 owing to lower number of outstanding shares.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations declined marginally to $0.74 per share from $0.75 in the year-ago quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.78.Total revenue for the reported quarter improved to $502.6 million from $492.7 million in the prior-year period due to modest organic growth at constant currency basis. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $512 million. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) from continuing operations for the quarter decreased 1.1% year over year to $245.7 million.Decision Analytics segment's revenues from continuing operations remained almost flat at $313.2 million and accounted for 62.3% of total revenue. Energy and Specialized Markets category revenues declined 5.9% year over year to $106.3 million, owing to end-market headwinds and lower revenues in environmental health and safety solutions. Insurance category revenues increased 4.1% to $178.6 million on solid underwriting solutions growth. Financial Services category revenues were marginally down to $28.3 million, as growth in media effectiveness and core banking solutions were offset by completed contracts.Risk Assessment segment's revenues grew 5.4% to $189.4 million, accounting for 37.7% of total revenue. Property-specific rating and underwriting information revenues improved 3.5% to $43.8 million, driven by an increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenues. Industry-standard insurance programs revenues were up 5.9% to $145.6 million, primarily attributable to growth in new solutions.During the quarter, Verisk acquired Bangalore-based data solutions company, Fintellix. Founded in 2006, Fintellix specializes in the development of data management platforms and regulatory reporting solutions for financial institutions. The company offers analytics, risk and compliance solutions for the banking sector.Per the agreement, Fintellix will become part of Verisk's Argus business. Fintellix's advanced data management platform, along with its regulatory reporting expertise, will be a valuable addition to both Argus and Verisk. The collaboration will help the company offer better services and highly advanced solutions to its customers. In addition, this deal will also enable Verisk expand its foothold across India as well.Verisk also purchased Arium, a liability risk modeling and decision support firm, for an undisclosed amount. Formed in 1998, Arium or Architects for Risk Identification, Understanding, and Management specializes in developing risk models, mainly for the reinsurance industry. The company uses a unique methodology based on dependency theory. Its casualty analytics platform enables other companies to run historical and emerging scenarios and build their own scenarios across all casualty lines. Incorporating Arium's methodologies will enable Verisk's clients to comprehensively manage risks across their portfolios in the casualty market. We expect the acquisitions to be accretive for the company in the near future.At the end of the quarter, Verisk had about $155 million in cash and cash equivalents with long-term debt of $2,281 million. Net cash generated from operating activities in the reported quarter was $317.9 million compared with $303.9 million in the prior-year period.Verisk repurchased 1.3 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $81.24 per share for $104 million. At quarter end, the company had $532 million worth of shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization.Verisk continues to deliver outstanding data analytics solutions to its customers across its core verticals of insurance, natural resources, and financial services. The company's ability to generate strong cash enables it to meet its deleveraging objectives and helps it invest on behalf of its shareholders.It turns out fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been three revisions lower for the current quarter. | At this time, Verisk Analytics' stock has a nice Growth Score of 'B', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a 'D'. Following the same course, the stock was allocated a grade of 'D' on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'C'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our style scores.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise that the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect below average returns from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the July 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new July 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of 25 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $75.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $74.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $80.40/share today.Because the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 86%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $80.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.91% if the stock gets called away at the July 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 82%.

n Jun 6, we updated the research report on business information services manufacturer  .Headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, Verisk offers data analytics services to diverse industries such as insurance, natural resources, healthcare, financial services, government, and risk management. Leveraging unique data assets and deep domain expertise, Verisk provides first-to-market predictive analytics and decision support solutions that are integrated into customer workflows for a positive outcome. Over the years, Verisk solutions have enabled customers to take informed decisions about risk, investments, and operations with greater precision, efficiency, and discipline.A significant portion of the company's revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. With modest revenues coming from the U.K., Verisk is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company. These undermine the long-term growth potential of the company to some extent.Verisk has grossly underperformed the  industry in the last three months with an average loss of 0.4% against a gain of 4.4% for the latter. On a P/E (TTM) basis, Verisk looks a bit overvalued compared with the benchmark S&P 500 index with respective tallies of 26.3x and 20.4x in the last three-month period. The stock is currently trading at the lower range of this period. This forces us to be somewhat cautious on the stock and investors should ideally wait for a better entry point.The company recently acquired MAKE, a leading research and advisory business specializing in wind power. Per the deal, MAKE will become part of Verisk's operating unit, Wood Mackenzie. This acquisition will enhance the company's offerings to its existing clients and help it become the leading market analysis and advisory firm. Also, in Jul 2016, Wood Mackenzie acquired Greentech Media. The company is continuing to expand its foothold in data and insight for the power and renewables sector. Decarbonization is currently in demand in the energy industry. Wood Mackenzie is strategically acquiring such companies to offer its clients the most advanced solutions in the renewables sector. The addition of MAKE to Wood Mackenzie would complement the company's existing practice. The continuous acquisitions, however, are putting pressure on the company's profitability.However, Verisk has a recurring revenue stream with 75% of its total revenue generated from subscription and long-term contracts. In addition, the company has a large and diverse addressable market with low customer concentration that mitigates operating risks. Operating in an industry with high barriers to entry, Verisk has an integrated research, sales & marketing, and consulting model designed to best serve client needs. This enables it to offer a steady stream of first-to-market innovations that provide a competitive advantage against its rivals.Verisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include Hitachi, Ltd.  , Publicis Groupe S.A.  and NCI, Inc.  . Publicis Groupe and NCI carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Hitachi sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Hitachi is currently trading at a forward P/E of 11.5x. It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13%.Publicis Groupe has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.51%.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.0, after changing hands as low as $76.52 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 57.6. A bullish investor could look at VRSK's 29.0 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

ccording to a compiled study by ISO, a subsidiary of  , and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, the private U.S. property/casualty insurance industry reported a drastic fall in earnings in the first quarter of 2017 due to a challenging macro-economic environment.According to the report, net income after taxes for the beleaguered industry decreased 42.2% year over year to $7.7 billion in first-quarter 2017 from $13.4 billion in the year-ago period. Overall profitability (measured by its annualized rate of return on average policyholders' surplus) fell to 4.4% from 7.9% as the industry faced three catastrophic events in the quarter.These included severe wind and thunderstorms that led to about $7.3 billion in direct catastrophe losses, the highest first-quarter catastrophe losses recorded since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The combined ratio for insurers declined to 99.6% from 97.4% for first-quarter 2016. Annualized quarterly investment yield was 3.0% in first-quarter 2017, which was quite low compared with the 3.6% average annualized quarterly yield over the last decade.However, not everything was gloomy for the industry and there were some encouraging revelations to cheer about. Net written premium growth improved to 4.0% in first-quarter 2017 from 3.2% a year ago, while net investment gains were up $1.2 billion year over year to $14.4 billion. The industry's surplus reached a new all-time high of $709.0 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.The industry is expected to absorb these short-term volatilities due to high capitalization and catastrophe losses are not likely to affect its ability to provide coverage and pay claims. However, in order to remain profitable and offer healthy return on investments, the industry requires long-term planning and disciplined underwriting efforts based on robust data and analytical insights. It is at this point when Verisk's expertise and in-depth knowhow come to the fore.Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze troves of data, Verisk draws on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide predictive analytics and decision support solutions that are integrated into customer workflows. These facilitate its customers to take informed decisions with greater precision, efficiency, and discipline about various risks involved in the businesses. In order to create long-term value for its clients, the company has extended its scalable data and analytic solutions by steadily putting resources into overseas markets. The scalability of its products has further led to highly cash-generative businesses characterized by high net margins and relatively low capital intensity.However, Verisk has grossly underperformed the  industry with an average year-to-date return of 2.5% compared with a gain of 17.4% for the latter.Verisk currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include S&P Global, Inc.  and Intertek Group plc  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and National Research Corporation  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .S&P Global has a solid long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.3%.Intertek Group has a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 12%.National Research has beaten earnings estimate twice in the trailing four quarters with a positive earnings surprise of 4.4%.Just released, today's 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention. If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List, they should be removed immediately. These are sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments.

ata analytics services provider  reported sedate first-quarter 2017 results on muted industry growth and related headwinds. Net income from continuing operations decreased to $108.8 million from $109.7 million in the year-earlier quarter on higher operating expenses. On a per share basis, net income from continuing operations remained flat at 64 cents owing to lower number of outstanding shares.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations declined marginally to 74 cents per share from 75 cents in the year-ago quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.Total revenue for the reported quarter improved to $502.6 million from $492.7 million in the prior-year period due to modest organic growth at constant currency basis. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $512 million. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) from continuing operations for the quarter decreased 1.1% year over year to $245.7 million.Decision Analytics segment's revenues from continuing operations remained almost flat at $313.2 million and accounted for 62.3% of total revenue. Energy and Specialized Markets category revenues declined 5.9% year over year to $106.3 million, owing to end-market headwinds and lower revenues in environmental health and safety solutions. Insurance category revenues increased 4.1% to $178.6 million on solid underwriting solutions growth. Financial Services category revenues were marginally down to $28.3 million, as growth in media effectiveness and core banking solutions were offset by completed contracts.Risk Assessment segment's revenues grew 5.4% to $189.4 million, accounting for 37.7% of total revenue. Property-specific rating and underwriting information revenues improved 3.5% to $43.8 million, driven by an increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenues. Industry-standard insurance programs revenues were up 5.9% to $145.6 million, primarily attributable to growth in new solutions.During the quarter, Verisk acquired Bangalore-based data solutions company, Fintellix. Founded in 2006, Fintellix specializes in the development of data management platforms and regulatory reporting solutions for financial institutions. The company offers analytics, risk and compliance solutions for the banking sector.Per the agreement, Fintellix will become part of Verisk's Argus business. Fintellix's advanced data management platform, along with its regulatory reporting expertise, will be a valuable addition to both Argus and Verisk. The collaboration will help the company offer better services and highly advanced solutions to its customers. In addition, this deal will also enable Verisk expand its foothold across India as well.Verisk also purchased Arium, a liability risk modeling and decision support firm, for an undisclosed amount. Formed in 1998, Arium or Architects for Risk Identification, Understanding, and Management specializes in developing risk models, mainly for the reinsurance industry. The company uses a unique methodology based on dependency theory. Its casualty analytics platform enables other companies to run historical and emerging scenarios and build their own scenarios across all casualty lines. Incorporating Arium's methodologies will enable Verisk's clients to comprehensively manage risks across their portfolios in the casualty market. We expect the acquisitions to be accretive for the company in the near future. | At the end of the quarter, Verisk had about $155 million in cash and cash equivalents with long-term debt of $2,281 million. Net cash generated from operating activities in the reported quarter was $317.9 million compared with $303.9 million in the prior-year period.Verisk repurchased 1.3 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $81.24 per share for $104 million. At quarter end, the company had $532 million worth of shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization.Verisk continues to deliver outstanding data analytics solutions to its customers across its core verticals of insurance, natural resources, and financial services. The company's ability to generate strong cash enables it to meet its deleveraging objectives and helps it invest on behalf of its shareholders.Verisk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include CBIZ, Inc.  , S&P Global, Inc.  and Huron Consulting Group Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .CBIZ topped estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 18.4%.S&P Global has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.3%. It has a positive earnings history, beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Huron has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.5%. It has a positive earnings history, beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

usiness information services firm  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2017 results after market close on May 2. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, Verisk beat earnings estimates twice, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.34%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Verisk continues to deliver outstanding data analytics solutions to customers across its core verticals of insurance, natural resources, and financial services. During the quarter, Verisk acquired a liability risk modeling and decision support company, Arium for an undisclosed amount. Per the acquisition, Arium became part of Verisk's AIR Worldwide (AIR) business. This deal augments AIR's product portfolio with additional modeling solutions and analytics for the casualty market. Arium's methodologies enable Verisk's clients to comprehensively manage risks across their portfolios in the casualty market. The company expects this acquisition to be accretive for the company in the quarter to be reported.In addition, the company also inked an agreement to acquire Bangalore-based data solutions company, Fintellix. The financials of the agreement remain undisclosed. Per the agreement, Fintellix will become part of Verisk's Argus business. Argus is a leading provider of information, scoring solutions, and advisory services to financial institutions worldwide. Fintellix's advanced data management platform, along with its regulatory reporting expertise, will be a valuable addition to both Argus and Verisk Analytics. The collaboration will help the company offer better services and highly advanced solutions to its customers. In addition, this deal will also enable Verisk expand its foothold across India as well. The company's acquisition spree will likely boost the top line.Verisk aims to create long-term value through organic and better return on invested capital. The company continuously seeks to expand its portfolio by leveraging on its deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new, proprietary data sets and predictive analytics, by working in unison with its customers to understand their evolving needs. Verisk recorded average organic revenue growth of about 8% over the past 10 years. At the same time, the company continues to extend its footprint in new markets, with healthy long-term growth potential, through targeted international expansion. This holistic growth model is expected to strengthen its leading position in the market.However, a significant portion of the company's revenues is generated from operations outside the United States. With modest revenues coming from the U.K., Verisk is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company. These undermine the long-term growth potential of the company to some extent.Verisk's business model centers on large troves of data. Consequently, the company is susceptible to operational risks related to security breaches in its facilities, computer networks, and databases, resulting in a loss of its credibility and/or customers. Data theft and misuse by third-party contractors could also lead to loss of businesses and jeopardize the fundamental existence of the company.Despite the inherent strengths, our proven model does not conclusively show that Verisk is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Most Accurate estimate for the company stands at 77 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 78 cents. So, the difference - the Earnings ESP - is -1.28%. |  : Verisk carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with -1.28% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:AGCO Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.88%, and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see Altra Industrial Motion Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.00%, and a Zacks Rank #2.Adient plc  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.64%, and a Zacks Rank #3.While we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 19th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new May 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.65. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $78.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $80.82/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.06% return on the cash commitment, or 12.76% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of 55 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $80.82/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.85% if the stock gets called away at the May 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 74%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

n Mar 2, we initiated a research report on business services provider  .Headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, Verisk offers data analytics services to diverse industries such as insurance, natural resources, healthcare, financial services, government and risk management. Using advanced technologies to collect and analyze troves of data, Verisk draws on unique data assets and deep domain expertise to provide predictive analytics and decision support solutions that are integrated into customer workflows. This helps its customers make informed decisions with greater precision, efficiency and discipline about various risks involved in the businesses. In order to create long-term value for its clients, the company has extended its scalable data and analytic solutions by steadily putting resources into overseas markets. The scalability of its products has further led to highly cash-generative businesses characterized by high net margins and relatively low capital intensity.Verisk aims to create long-term value through organic growth and better return on invested capital. The company continuously seeks to expand its portfolio by leveraging its deep knowledge and embedded position to develop new, proprietary data sets and predictive analytics by working in unison with its customers to understand their evolving needs. Verisk recorded an average organic revenue growth of about 8% over the past 10 years. At the same time, it continues to extend its footprint in new markets, with healthy long-term growth potential, through targeted international expansion. This holistic growth model is likely to strengthen its leading position in the market.Verisk offers advanced technologies to capture and interpret imagery, telemetry data, sensory data and other emergent data sets in real time and at scale. At the same time, it provides visualization and consumability with emphasis on geo-location to predict weather patterns in advance. Multivariate regression trees and algorithms to estimate event likelihood and cohort belonging along with simulated Monte Carlo experiments for highly coupled nonlinear systems with wide variability and high underlying betas remain its forte. Such a deep technical prowess for analytics and Big Data provide an unrivalled edge over its competitors.However, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the U.S. P&C (property & casualty) insurers (approximately 48.9% of total revenue in 2016). The insurance industry is likely to struggle for top- and bottom-line growth with evolving rules and regulations. Challenging organic growth prospects are likely to force the industry to seek cost-cutting measures and newer avenues for growth. This could lead to lower revenue generation for Verisk in the future quarters.In addition, a significant portion of the company's revenues is generated from operations outside the U.S. With modest revenues coming from the U.K., Verisk is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company. These undermine the long-term growth potential of the company to some extent.Nevertheless, Verisk appears poised for healthy long-term growth despite stiff competition from peers such as IHS Markit Ltd.  , National Research Corporation  and TransUnion  .If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

During the quarter, Verisk acquired The GeoInformation Group, a premier provider of geographic data solutions, for an undisclosed amount. In addition, Verisk Insurance Solutions launched its new energy insurance unit. This unit will focus on providing analytical services to the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation, and metals and mining industries to help improve operational efficiencies, minimize costs, and expand profitably. This will, in turn, help the company improve its top line in the to-be-reported quarter.During the quarter, the company also announced the acquisition of MarketStance, whose proprietary analytics model will help provide actionable insights in the insurance industry. The acquisition is likely to be accretive for the company in the near future.

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $82.39/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the June put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.7% return against the $75 commitment, or a 4.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisk Analytics Inc sees its shares decline 9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $73.70 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.30 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June put at the $75 strike for the 4.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Verisk Analytics Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $82.39) to be 16%.

n Jan 3, 2017, Zacks  downgraded  to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold) earlier. Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #4 have high chances of underperforming the broader market in the quarters ahead.Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Ingersoll-Rand designs, manufactures, sells and services a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products across the globe. From enhancing the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings to transporting and protecting food and perishables, the product portfolio of the company secures homes and commercial properties and increases industrial productivity and efficiency.Ingersoll continues to reposition its portfolio to focus on high-barrier markets. While such efforts are encouraging, they involve upfront costs which are likely to lead to earnings dilution in the near term. Consequently, the company is continually under stress to maintain profitability through stringent cost-cutting measures. Additionally, its international operations are subject to economic risks. Further, operations may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions and local government regulations.The company designs, manufactures and services products that incorporate advanced technologies, and entail various operating risks. The failure to develop new products and services that are readily accepted by the market could have an adverse impact on the company's results in the long term. In addition, Ingersoll operates in a competitive market, due to which it has to continually invest in R&D initiatives to stay ahead of competition. This increases its operating costs.Presently, with the economy in Europe being highly unpredictable post the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for the company to increase revenues and reduce costs. In addition, Ingersoll is likely to be stifled by the renegotiated deals and restrictions imposed on trade with other European Union members. Brexit could further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, lowering productivity of the company.However, the company outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry with an average return of 12% compared with 6.4% for the latter, over the past 90 days. Over the same time period, the consensus estimate for the full year jumped from $4.09 to $4.20 per share today.

n Dec 30, Zacks  updated the research report on consulting services company,  .Headquartered in Chicago, IL, Navigant is a provider of specialized consulting services. Its staff of seasoned consultants and industry leaders provides litigation support and investigative services, claims management and analysis, corporate finance services, discovery services, government contracting services as well as operations advisory and management process outsourcing services.Opportunities associated with healthcare reform continue to drive demand as the industry seeks expertise to improve profitability and address increasing regulatory pressures for compliance. The demand for data analytics in healthcare across all markets is also growing, given the access to new data as a result of the Affordable Care Act and new technologies. The company is presently developing data analytic tools across multiple groups to meet the growing demand for technology-enabled solutions that can help clients address many of the market challenges.Management is taking steps to restructure the business in order to better align the capacity with demand. Utilizing its strong cash flow generation capacity, the company continues to return capital to its shareholders and making investments in technology, new capabilities and client channels. At the same time, Navigant is focusing on corporate development efforts to build a robust pipeline of investment opportunities which is in line with its growth strategy. All these measures augur well for the long-term growth.Navigant has outperformed the  industry with an average return of 29.16% against a negative 0.72% for the latter, over a period of 90 days. In addition, over the same time frame, earnings estimates for the current year increased 7.9%.However, Navigant continues to face challenges on both the domestic and international fronts. This is primarily attributable to the difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations, relatively limited new assignments, currency fluctuations and regulatory stringencies due to the uncertainty in the global economy. At the same time, Navigant relies heavily on a group of senior-level consultants and business development professionals. The future success of the company is largely dependent on its ability to successfully recruit and retain its people. Competition for skilled consultants is intense and retention-related issues are a constant challenge for the company. The consulting industry has low barriers to entry and it is easier for consultants to start their own businesses. While hiring and retention of personnel are keys to driving revenues, full-time equivalent levels and related consultant compensation in excess of demand drive additional costs and can negatively impact the company's margins.Navigant currently carries a Zacks Rank 2 (Buy).

usiness information services firm  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2016 results after the markets closes on Nov 1. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, Verisk managed to beat earnings estimates twice, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 2.63%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Verisk continues to deliver outstanding data analytics solutions to customers across its core verticals of insurance, natural resources, and financial services. The company's ability to generate strong cash enables it to meet its deleveraging objectives and helps it invest on behalf of its shareholders. However, the company is focused on inorganic growth due to which it has to incur one-time expenses to ensure long-term gains.During the quarter, Verisk Insurance Solutions collaborated with SAP SE (SAP) to utilize its cloud-based solution Circular Authority for Insurance for tracking and analyzing Insurance Service Office Circulars. The addition of this software to Verisk's product portfolio will add value and functionality for its customers. Such collaborations will help the company augment its product offering, hence enhancing its top-line.In addition, Verisk Insurance Solutions also launched its new energy insurance unit. This unit will focus on providing analytical services to the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation, and metals and mining industries, which will help improve operational efficiencies, minimize costs, and expand profitably in challenging markets.Also, Elizabeth Casas was appointed as Verisk Insurance Solutions' managing director of energy and insurance. Casas has immense experience, having served companies in New York, Houston, London, Colombia, and Mexico. Prior to joining Verisk, she was the vice president and senior energy underwriter at Swiss Re Houston. Such appointments will help improve the company's decision-making abilities and will help it gain contracts going forward.The company also acquired data and subscriptions segment of Quest Offshore Resources, Inc.. The acquired segment is now part of Wood Mackenzie, Verisk's Analytics business. The deal will expand Wood Mackenzie's service offerings. The company will be able to offer better ways to analyze the offshore oil and gas sector. This acquisition will enhance the client's investment decisions by helping them understand the availability, capability, and cost in key offshore equipment and service markets. Using Quest's expertise in the data and subscription business, Verisk will be well positioned to enhance offerings to its clients. The company also acquired Greentech Media which joined Wood Mackenzie to enhance its research and other capabilities for subsectors, including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These strategic acquisitions will likely help the company to attract favorable contracts during the quarter, augmenting its revenues. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Verisk is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently at -2.67%. : Verisk carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Please check our  that enables you find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.ONE Gas, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +31.58% and a Zacks Rank #2.You can see  .Post Properties Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

nvestors considering a purchase of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $82.10/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the June 2017 put at the $70 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.35. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.9% return against the $70 commitment, or a 3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $70 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisk Analytics Inc sees its shares fall 14.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $68.65 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.35 from $70), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June 2017 put at the $70 strike for the 3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Verisk Analytics Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $82.10) to be 21%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 821,165 contracts, with call volume at 821,165, for a put:call ratio of 0.70 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Commit To Buy Verisk Analytics At $70, Earn 3% Annualized Using Options@2016-10-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/commit-buy-verisk-analytics-70-earn-3-annualized-using-options-2016-10-25

"ou won't find too many folks who put Warren Buffett and men's suit linings in the same sentence. But that's exactly how Berkshire Hathaway, one of the largest companies in the world, got its start. In the 1960s, when the Massachusetts textile firm was struggling in the face of foreign competition, Berkshire CEO Buffett saw an investment opportunity-then used it as a springboard to buy other businesses.And we know how that turned out.Today, this $365.8 billion conglomerate powerhouse has over 300,000 employees and sales of over $200 billion, a far cry from a struggling textile mill. Its shareholder meetings (that draw upwards of 40,000 live spectators) have become a kind of bellwether of the global economy and have driven some to pitch tents the night before just to get a good seat. Buffett himself has become something of a cult figure, although the Oracle of Omaha is nothing close to an investment world diva. He's more a salt-of-the-earth sage with a tireless work ethic who believes in analyzing businesses by sizing up their core fundamentals. The ""next best thing"" is the last thing Buffett looks for. Instead, he seeks companies with what he calls ""durable competitive advantage"" protected by an ""enduring moat"". That is, well-managed businesses with solid structures that render them nearly impervious to competitors.While for the average investor Buffett sings the praises of index funds, Berkshire's holdings reflect a value approach much like that of his mentor Benjamin Graham. At Validea, we have simulated the strategies of both of these legendary investors, among others, for over a decade. Specifically, our Buffett-based investment model identifies companies with:Once a company passes these tests, the second stage of our screen evaluates the stock price by calculating expected rates of return based on both return-on-equity and earnings-per-share. A stock will pass if the average is at or above 12% (although a minimum of 15% is the best case scenario).While Buffett has traditionally shied away from the tech sector, this past May he changed his tune with Berkshire's $1 billion investment in Apple Inc. He has since boosted the firm's stake to 15.2 million shares (worth $1.46 billion at the end of the second quarter).Not surprisingly, Apple (  ) earns a perfect score under our Buffett-based investment model. Another Berkshire holding, Verisk Analytics Inc. (  ), also gets a nod under this screen: designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players and related software with products including iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod, and Apple TV. The company's earnings are predictable and earnings growth has been steady and healthy over the past ten years. Current earnings of $46.8 billion could pay off the company's debt within two years, and management generated a 28.6% return on retained earnings (calculated by comparing the change in earnings-per-share over the past ten years to the total amount of earnings retained over the same period), which well exceeds the minimum requirement of 15%. Return-on-equity (10-year average) of 29.9% is nearly double the model's requirement, and return-on-total capital of 27.6% is more than double the 12% minimum. is a data analytics provider servicing customers in insurance, natural resources, healthcare, financial services, government and risk management. It earns high marks from our Buffett-based model in light of its steady profitability and historical earnings-per-share growth of 18.1% (10-year average). The company boasts consistently higher than average return-on-assets (10-year average of 10.4%) and management generated a 16.0% return on retained earnings, more than acceptable under this screen.While the following three stocks are not currently in Berkshire's portfolio, they score well under our Buffett-based screening model: is a branded-play company offering toys, game products, television programming and motion pictures and related products in the U.S. and across the globe. Our Buffett-based investment model favors HAS's predicable earnings and debt coverage (earnings can satisfy all debt within five years). Return-on-equity of 21.7% (ten-year average) indicates durable competitive advantage and exceeds the model minimum requirement of 15%, and management's use of retained earnings reflects a return of 16.7%. Using the models expected stock return formula, the shares could deliver a long term return of between 7-8%. is a global provider of information technology and knowledge process outsourcing services for the banking, healthcare, pharmaceutical, insurance and manufacturing sectors. Our Buffett-based strategy likes the company's consistent earnings history and conservative debt levels (which earnings can satisfy in less than two years), as well as its long-term growth in earnings-per-share of 15.7%. Average return-on-equity over the last ten years of 29.7% reflects durable competitive advantage, and ten-year average return-on-total-capital (which includes debt) of 28.9% is more than double the model's minimum requirement of 12%. The compounded rate of return on the stock is expected to be above 18% according to the model's calculations. manufactures and distributes paint, coatings and related products in the U.S. and Latin America. This company is a ""household name"" which scores highly under our Buffett-based model due to its durable competitive advantage. This model also favors SHW's conservative financing structure (debt can be satisfied by earnings within two years), and ten-year average return-on-equity of 31.3% (more than double the best case minimum). Return-on-total capital (which includes debt) of 25.5% is also more than double the minimum requirement, and management generated a return of 16.7% on retained earnings. Given the firm's earnings and return on equity, the stock looks like it could generate a long term return of around 11%.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@An Inside Look at Buffett’s Stock Selection Method@2016-08-31@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/inside-look-buffetts-stock-selection-method-2016-08-31

But the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet is the company's boldest bet so far. Jet aims to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on the quantity of items purchased. The company is almost certainly burning cash at a blistering pace, but the acquisition gives Wal-Mart an e-commerce brand that could grow very quickly in the coming years, as well as the services of Jet's founder.Wal-Mart expects to produce between $4.15 and $4.35 in adjusted EPS this year, putting the stock price at nearly 17 times the high of that range. That's not particularly cheap, but earnings will be depressed this year due to the company's investments. Still, I try to ensure an adequate margin of safety for all of my investments, and Wal-Mart has gotten just a bit too expensive. If the stock drops on short-term worries in the coming months, I'll be waiting. After running up 50% since the start of the year, energy infrastructure giant  (NYSE: KMI) is no longer the screaming bargain it once was. That said, there is certainly the case to be made that it is still on sale, given that shares are down more than 30% over the past year. However, I would rather wait until the next sale before bolstering my position any further.The reason Kinder Morgan's stock ran up so much this year is due to the significant progress it made on fixing its balance sheet problems. The company entered into  to sell or joint venture select assets. Those deals pushed its leverage ratio down to 5.3 times, which is below its year-end target for 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. That said, the company will not begin to return more cash to shareholders until its leverage is below 5.0 times debt to EBITDA. Given its current projections, that  .Because most investors are not that patient, I think they might grow restless, especially if Kinder Morgan does not start hinting that a dividend increase will happen early next year. That is why I am hoping that there just might be another golden opportunity to buy Kinder Morgan's stock in the near future. I could be wrong, and I own enough Kinder Morgan stock to be happy if it keeps going higher, but I would jump at the chance to buy more if the stock suddenly dropped by double digits due to investor impatience. I'm already a happy shareholder of  (NASDAQ: VRSK) , but I'm eagerly waiting for shares to go on sale so I can continue to build upon my small position.Verisk is a provider of tools and data analytics that help other businesses to measure and manage their risk profile. The company's primary customers are property and casualty insurers, but it is constantly adding new customers from other markets outside of the insurance sector that afford it plenty of long-term growth opportunities.Though Verisk might sound like a boring business to own, it exhibits many traits that make for an excellent long-term investment. For one, more than 80% of the company's revenue is subscription-based, and since Verisk boasts stellar retention rates, its top line is highly predictable. In addition, as a data provider, it costs the company very little to service additional customers, which allows Verisk to grow its profits at a faster rate than its revenue. data by  .Lastly, the company's data is proprietary and dates back to 1971, which gives it a huge leg up over competitors. And since its services are mission critical to its customers, Verisk can push along regular price increases without much fuss.All in all, Verisk is an extremely high-quality company with an enduring moat that I think should be able to grow at an above-average rate for years to come. I'd love to add to my position today, but the company's shares are currently trading for about 27 times full-year earnings estimates, hinting that they are a little bit pricey right now.

erisk Insurance Solutions, a unit of business service provider  , recently unveiled its 360Value Renewal Insight system to enable homeowner's insurers get insurance to value (ITV) till the policy period expires.This system utilizes the data from the company's Property InSight (aerial imagery-based data packages with location-specific details) to help calculate the present replacement estimates while renewing the policies.Per an industry study by Verisk, the possibility of an insurer's book of business to be underinsured is high, which can be avoided if the property information is updated with accurate details. It is a challenge to keep updating the changing costs related to a property, whereas it is also not possible for homeowners to continuously report property improvements. In such situations, the 360Value Renewal Insight will provide updated data during the renewal process.This highly advanced system will help provide accurate ITV over the life of the policy, which in turn will be profitable for insurers as well as policyholders. This system will augment the company's top line as more and more customers are likely to opt for this cost-saving hassle-free solution. Thus, this service will boost the company's client base, giving it an edge over its peers. | This year, the company also launched its new employee and workplace safety stewardship capabilities.

"n recent trading, shares of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $85.10, changing hands for $85.54/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Verisk Analytics Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $70.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $93.00. The standard deviation is $6.951.But the whole reason to look at the  VRSK price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with VRSK crossing above that average target price of $85.10/share, investors in VRSK have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $85.10 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Verisk Analytics Inc:

ver 60% of the total S&P 500 index members have released their second-quarter results through Jul 29. Following the disappointing trend set in other recent quarters, growth continues to remain elusive, while estimates have shown a decline although improving sequentially.

However, Autos, Construction, Conglomerates, Utilities, Medical, Retail, Consumer Discretionary and Business Services - eight in all - are projected to land up on the brighter side, booking growth this season.The Business Services sector is looking reasonably good. For the sector, earnings are expected to grow 5.7%, while sales are touted to rise 6.6% over last year.

" (  ) may not be the hottest name in the market or have the same brand recognition as, say,  (  ), but its stock has been on fire of late.A growing consumer credit market is benefiting the provider of consumer reports, risk scores and analytics, and TransUnion's diversification is helping it stand out from the pack. The company has transformed beyond its consumer credit roots and into a diversified risk management analytics firm. That's translated to soaring organic revenue growth and significant share price gains.Helping the Chicago-based company is what JPMorgan says is its extension into data sets that had been underutilized by consumer credit reporting vendors. That includes public records data such as court judgments, bankruptcies, liens, marriages and divorces. There's also driver history data as well as alternative data, including information on consumers with thin credit files.""While modest in scope currently, these unique offerings are growing quickly and morph TransUnion from a traditional (consumer reporting agency) into a diversified risk management solutions firm with an expanded addressable market,"" JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman said in an April 27 note to clients.He added that this evolution helps distinguish the June 2015 initial public offering from its primary competitors, namely Experian and  (  ), which is a member of Investor's Business Daily's IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks. The analyst notes that TransUnion is increasing its comparability to companies such as privately held LexisNexis Risk Solutions and  (  ) as well.A Zacks Equity Research report on May 10 noted the company's financial appeal, saying it has highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low capital requirements and cash flows that are ""strong and stable.""""Impressively, it deals with the 10 largest U.S. banks, the top 5 credit card issuers, the biggest 25 auto lenders, thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies,"" the Zacks report added.That recipe of a strong business model and notable client exposure had a positive impact on the company's latest quarterly results. After the market close on April 26, TransUnion reported a 60% rise in first-quarter adjusted earnings to 32 cents a share, beating analyst estimates for 26 cents. Revenue climbed 15% to $406 million for the quarter, handily topping projections for $380 million.""In our view, a beat in (2016's first quarter) was perhaps foreseeable, but the extent to which (TransUnion's) results outperformed despite lapping tougher (year-over-year) comps was exemplary,"" JPMorgan's Steinerman said.TransUnion's U.S. information services segment saw revenue grow 13% to $247 million, accounting for 57% of the top line total. Revenue from the company's international business increased 7% to 68 million, with 5% of the growth due to acquisitions. The company said the international segment's revenue growth would have been 22% on a constant currency basis.Consumer interactive revenue jumped 25% to $105 million, driven by strength in both direct and indirect solutions.""The new growth initiative investments, and productivity investments at Spark (a company analytics and technology investment project) are together helping to fuel not only impressive top line growth, but also notable margin expansion,"" said TransUnion Chief Executive Jim Peck during the company's quarterly conference call on April 26.TransUnion raised its full-year guidance, but it was on the conservative side. The company sees 2016 EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.34, up from $1.24 to $1.28 previously. The midpoint of $1.32 was a hair below projections for $1.33.TransUnion upped its revenue expectation to $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, from $1.6 billion to $1.62 billion, while analysts have modeled $1.66 billion.""While representing a slowdown from 2015's remarkable growth rates, 2016 guidance is likely lower due to mortgage assumptions, tough year-over-year comps, and beginning-of-year conservatism,"" Steinerman said. ""We find these goals achievable and we note guidance's implication that (TransUnion's) breadth and pace of growth will remain best-in-class.""Wall Street seems to have agreed. Shares vaulted 8.5% the day after the report to become extended from the 5% buy range from a cup-with-handle base it initially broke out of on March 29. Shares are now extended roughly 14% from the 27.15 buy point, after hitting a new all-time high and nearing the 20% profit-taking zone on May 10.TransUnion has risen roughly 38% from its June 2015 IPO price of 22.50. The stock earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, meaning it outperforms 98% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative share price performance.Looking ahead, TransUnion has more growth opportunities -- though it has strong prior-year metrics to compete against.""While we acknowledge tougher comps in the back half of the year, we are comfortable with (TransUnion's) forecasted margin expansion and continued strength in emerging verticals such as healthcare and insurance, in addition to the (2016's second half) launch of trended data with Fannie Mae that should boost performance,"" Cowen and Company analyst George Mihalos said in an April 27 research report.Steinerman says the company's management team is a ""critical component"" to the company's success.""Under current broad leadership, the company has diversified into tangential data sets/data analytics and has overhauled its technology infrastructure,"" he said.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@This Top-Rated Data Analytics Firm Is Seeing Exploding Growth@2016-05-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-rated-data-analytics-firm-seeing-exploding-growth-2016-05-13

usiness information services firm  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2016 results after the markets closes on Aug 2. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Over the last four quarters, earnings beat estimates thrice, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 7.78%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Verisk is focused on streamlining its business; as a result of this the company completed the sale of its healthcare business, worth $820 million. The sale is expected to enhance the company's focus on proprietary data analytics, which is its prime business.During the quarter, 3E Company, a division of Verisk, announced the launch of its new employee and workplace safety stewardship capabilities. 3E offers 24/7/365 Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) occurrence notification and reporting services, hazard communication training materials, and single sign-on authentication services for its customers. This launch is expected to boost top-line growth of the company in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.In addition, the company announced the expansion of its FireLine wildfire risk management service. Per the announcement, this service unit will expand across the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Based in the U.S., FireLine provides property-specific evaluation of wildfire risk that insurers use for various purposes which include underwriting, rating, and exposure management.Also, AIR Worldwide (AIR) - a business unit of Verisk - has expanded its earthquake and typhoon models for Southeast Asia. This model will provide insurers with a comprehensive and up-to-date view of risk in the region. The new earthquake model is built to account for tsunami and liquefaction subperils for earthquake prone areas which include Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Additionally, the model reach has been expanded to include the following countries and territories: Guam, Macau, Saipan, and Vietnam for typhoon risk; and Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and Malaysia for earthquake risk. This footprint expansion will bode well for the company. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Verisk is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it lacks key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently at -1.32%. Verisk carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Expeditors International of Washington Inc.  , earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #3.ONEOK Partners, L.P.  , earnings ESP of +3.77% and a Zacks Rank #2.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.  , earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - April 29, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  and Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Reminiscent of the performance in the last two years, the U.S. economy had a lackluster start to 2016 as the GDP grew at a paltry 0.5% annualized rate in the first quarter. Rather than being an indicator of a recession, the near-zero GDP growth signifies an economy that is inured to a sluggish pace of expansion with an average annual growth of 2%.Shaking off initial jitters from a global equity sell-off and concerns for an economic slowdown in China, the domestic equity market gradually picked up steam as the investors' fears were allayed by an apparent pick-up in China's economy. Oil prices have also recovered steadily, while the strength of the U.S. dollar has somewhat waned.However, the Fed has decided not to go overboard with its interest rate hikes, projecting only two hikes against four anticipated last December when it first raised interest rates in nearly a decade.Many economists feel that the first-quarter GDP data is an aberration and is not a true representation of the underlying growth boosters, the most notable among which is job additions. On an average there were 209,000 job additions per month in the first quarter.The unemployment rate rose marginally to 5% in March from 4.9% in the previous month due to a higher participation rate of 63% as more people looked for work - a clear indication that the economy was indeed improving.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence levels went up. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index improved moderately in March to 96.2 from 94 in February.However, consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. economy, is expected to significantly decline from 2.4% in fourth-quarter 2015 as it edged up a mere 0.1% in both January and February. Economists speculated that a dent in consumption was largely triggered by a massive stock market sell-off at the beginning of the year as households cut back on purchases and were keener on savings.Non-defense capital goods orders (excluding aircraft), one of the closely watched parameters for business spending plans, contracted 1.1% in the first quarter.

"eminiscent of the performance in the last two years, the U.S. economy had a lackluster start to 2016 as the GDP grew at a paltry 0.5% annualized rate in the first quarter. Rather than being an indicator of a recession, the near-zero GDP growth signifies an economy that is inured to a sluggish pace of expansion with an average annual growth of 2%.Shaking off initial jitters from a global equity sell-off and concerns for an economic slowdown in China, the domestic equity market gradually picked up steam as the investors' fears were allayed by an apparent pick-up in China's economy. Oil prices have also recovered steadily, while the strength of the U.S. dollar has somewhat waned.However, the Fed has decided not to go overboard with its interest rate hikes, projecting only two hikes against four anticipated last December when it first raised interest rates in nearly a decade.Many economists feel that the first-quarter GDP data is an aberration and is not a true representation of the underlying growth boosters, the most notable among which is job additions. On an average there were 209,000 job additions per month in the first quarter.The unemployment rate rose marginally to 5% in March from 4.9% in the previous month due to a higher participation rate of 63% as more people looked for work - a clear indication that the economy was indeed improving.Enjoying the fruits of a resurgent job market, low inflationary pressures and cheaper oil bills, consumer confidence levels went up. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index improved moderately in March to 96.2 from 94 in February.However, consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. economy, is expected to significantly decline from 2.4% in fourth-quarter 2015 as it edged up a mere 0.1% in both January and February. Economists speculated that a dent in consumption was largely triggered by a massive stock market sell-off at the beginning of the year as households cut back on purchases and were keener on savings.Non-defense capital goods orders (excluding aircraft), one of the closely watched parameters for business spending plans, contracted 1.1% in the first quarter. Business spending on equipment advanced 1.4% in the first quarter largely driven by military equipment.With lower orders, businesses are expected to accumulate $48-$56 billion worth of inventory in the first quarter (significantly down from $78.3 billion in the fourth quarter), as companies ramp up efforts to reduce inventory bloat, thereby paring seven-tenth of a percentage point from the first-quarter GDP growth.The Markit Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data declined to 51.3 in March from 53.2 in January.

 reported adjusted first-quarter 2016 earnings of 47 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Reported revenues came at $1.49 billion, up 2.0% year over year due to solid performance by its Buy and Watch businesses. Also, revenues were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5.2%.Buy business revenues were $793 million (53% of total revenue), down 0.6% year over year but up 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the foreign currency impact, revenues in the Developed and Emerging markets grew 2.0% and 10.0%, respectively.Watch business revenues were $694 million (47%), up 5.2% year over year or 6.3% on a constant currency basis. The increase came on the back of continued strength in Audience Measurement and marketing effectiveness, which improved 7.5% and 28.8%, respectively, on a constant currency basis.Reported gross margin was 56.9%, down 40 basis points (bps) from the year-ago period.Nielsen's operating expenses, namely selling, general and administrative expenses of $465 million, were down 3.3% from the year-ago figure of $481 million. However, operating margin expanded 150 bps year over year to 15.1%.On a GAAP basis, Nielsen recorded net profit of $100 million or 27 cents per share compared with $63 million or 17 cents in the year-ago quarter.On an adjusted basis, net profit per share came in at 47 cents compared with 42 cents a year ago.Nielsen exited the quarter with cash balance of approximately $432 million against $357 million in the last quarter.

The company reported decent results in the first quarter of 2016.Continued dividend payment and share repurchase reflect Nielsen's financial strength and commitment to return value to shareholders. Also, the company's product launches are progressing well and should drive revenues in the near term.However, continued investments in technology and infrastructure could weigh on margins and profitability, going forward.Currently, Nielsen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Verisk Analytics, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation  and FactSet Research Systems Inc.  carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 35.2%. Also, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in all the last four quarters, bringing the average to 83.23%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Changyou has gained recognition for its offerings like Tian Long Ba Bu (TLBB). Also, the company unveiled TLBB 3D in 2014, which continues to drive demand. Newer games like Warframe and Tree of Savior are also expected to contribute to revenues in the to-be reported quarter. Additionally, the China-based game developer stepped up its R&D efforts to develop more innovative and user friendly mobile games while also cutting down on its expenses. These should help the company post decent results in the to-be reported quarter.However, Changyou is facing operational challenges from the ongoing transition. Also, sluggishness in the online game and advertising businesses hurt margins. Increasing competition from players like NetEase, Inc.  remains a concern.Nonetheless, a rebounding Chinese economy, a strong product portfolio and a favorable valuation are positives for the company.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Changyou is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Changyou currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents. Changyou has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks that have a favorable rank and a positive ESP and are likely to post an earnings beat this quarter:Silicon Motion Technology Corp.  with Earnings ESP of +7.27% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Verisk Analytics, Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +1.30% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 scored a third successive beat with its first-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 30 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents by a remarkable 20%. Robust top line growth, coupled with productivity improvement initiatives, drove the company's profits.The credit-reporting company's shares rose 1.6% in after-hours trading, as it delivered stronger-than-expected first quarter results and raised its 2016 guidance as well.Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $58.2 million, almost doubling from the previous-year quarter's tally of $29.6 million. Strong growth momentum across the three segments, combined with new product growth initiatives, led to the impressive bottom line performance.Revenues for the quarter increased roughly 15% year over year to $406 million, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $380 million. On a constant currency basis, the top line rose 17.6% year over year, driven by double-digit growth across all three segments.Revenues in the  segment came in at $247 million, up 12.8% year over year. The segment saw solid growth in financial services, rental screening, insurance and healthcare verticals. Online Data Services revenue grew 9.7% year over year to $161 million due to higher credit report volumes.Marketing Services revenue was $36.9 million, up 11.8% from the prior-year period, driven by higher batch activity resulting from demand for solutions such as CreditVision. Decision Services revenues grew 24.7% year over year to $49 million, driven by robust healthcare and insurance markets.The  segment revenue rose 6.8% year over year to $67.8 million. However, on a constant currency basis, revenues grew an impressive 21.9%. While revenues from developed markets increased 10.8% (19% on a constant currency basis) to $23.2 million, that from emerging markets went up 4.8% (up 23.3% on a constant currency basis) to $44.6 million.Canada and Hong Kong stood out with solid growth, along with emerging markets like India, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.Revenues in the  segment came in at $106.1 million, up 25.4% year over year, driven by significant revenue growth from both direct and indirect channels.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $141.4 million, up 23.1% from $114.8 million in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted operating income for the reported quarter increased 24.3% year over year to $113.4 million, while adjusted operating margin for the quarter rose 210 basis points year over year. Successful productivity enhancement initiatives helped transmit the striking revenue growth to the bottom line, thus expanding margins.The USIS segment's adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 31.2% on a year over year basis. The increase was driven by growth in top line, partly offset by higher product costs and investments in strategic growth initiatives.The International segment's adjusted operating margin increased 240 basis points to 24.8% on a year over year basis, which was driven by an increase in revenues and productivity initiatives.The Consumer Interactive segment's adjusted operating margin rose 560 basis points to 39.8% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was driven by top line growth as well as improved productivity.As of Mar 31, 2016, TransUnion had cash and cash equivalents of $150.3 million compared with $133.2 million as of Dec 31, 2015. Long-term debt stood at $2,309.5 million at quarter end, compared with $2,160.7 million as of Dec 31, 2015.For the first quarter, cash flow generated from operating activities aggregated $41.7 million compared with $16.5 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues as well as lower interest expense.Encouraged by its robust top and bottom line growth in the first quarter, TransUnion raised its full-year 2016 guidance. Consolidated revenues are now expected to lie in the range of $1.63 billion and $1.65 billion (up from earlier expectations of $1.6 billion and $1.62 billion), reflecting year-over-year growth of about 10% to 12%.Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to come in the range of $600 million and $610 million (compared with the previously guided range of $580 million and $590 million), up 16-18% year over year. The outlook for 2016 adjusted earnings per share was increased from $1.24-$1.28 to a range of $1.30 and $1.34, which now reflects earnings growth of 19-23% year over year.For second-quarter 2016, consolidated revenues are expected to come in the range of $405 million and $410 million, up about 10% to 11% compared with the previous-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is likely to be in the range of $145-$150 million, an increase of about 11-15% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between 31-33 cents during the quarter, up 15-22% year over year.We expect TransUnion's solid growth momentum to accelerate in the near future, as it continues to leverage new product growth initiatives, key strategic investments and productivity initiatives. The company stands to benefit from offerings and growth initiatives like CreditVision and digital marketing, as well as newer initiatives, like Prama.However, adverse foreign currency translation impact will likely continue to be a formidable headwind for the company.TransUnion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include The Dun & Bradstreet Corp.  , FactSet Research Systems Inc.  and Verisk Analytics, Inc.  .

nvestors considering a purchase of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $85.40/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.25. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.7% return against the $75 commitment, or a 4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Verisk Analytics Inc sees its shares fall 12.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $73.75 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.25 from $75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $75 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $75 strike for the 4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Verisk Analytics Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $85.40) to be 25%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  . (  ) is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 18, after the market closes. Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.68%. Over the past four quarters, the company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.37%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.IBM had a tough 2015 given the ongoing and heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud. Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware along with foreign exchange volatility remain added concerns.We believe that revenues will continue to be affected in the near term as the company is currently transitioning to higher-growth markets that are not yielding enough to offset declines in traditional segments. Also, intensifying competition in the industry is a major headwind.Nevertheless, IBM's strategic growth initiatives, including its Big Data & business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth. In 2015, cloud, analytics, social, mobile and security revenues grew 17% over the last year and represented 35% of total revenue in the year. Cloud revenues grew 43%, business analytics revenues grew 7%, security business revenues increased 5% while mobile business registered a threefold jump. Reportedly, IBM estimates SoftLayer to generate $1 billion in revenues in 2016. SoftLayer is the primary infrastructure of IBM's cloud operations.In addition, IBM's policy of making strategic acquisitions (over 150 companies since 2000) will lead to incremental revenues, strengthening its technology leadership and resulting in a more favorable mix of business. The acquisitions have also increased its scale of operations globally. This year IBM has made 10 acquisitions so far, which include Bluewolf Group, Resilient Systems, Truven Health Analytics,Optevia and The Weather Company's B2B, mobile and cloud-based web-properties. Strong cash flow generation is expected to provide the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the changing business environment.Our proven model does not conclusively show that IBM is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. IBM has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.07. IBM carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some stocks worth considering that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Silicon Motion Technology Corp.

 is set to report second quarter fiscal 2016 results on Apr 20, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 6.82%. Over the past four quarters, the company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 2.07%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that a strong number of program wins is a big positive for the company. In the last reported quarter, Plexus won 34 programs worth approximately $179 million in its Manufacturing Solutions group. Plexus anticipates these wins to contribute about 3% to 4% to revenues in the second quarter. As an engineering-focused EMS player, it is well positioned to benefit from increasing outsourcing trend among health care, industrial and defense/aerospace OEMs.Plexus has also been growing its manufacturing footprint in low-cost regions, like Mexico, Malaysia, China and Romania. With the construction of the new facility in Guadalajara, Mexico now complete, we believe the company's shift into low cost regions as well as consolidation of manufacturing facilities will boost profitability.However, macroeconomic headwinds as well as softening end-market demand continue to remain big worries for Plexus. The company's significant exposure (35% of revenues) to the slowing Networking and Communications industry also remains an added concern.For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, revenues are projected in the range of $600 million - $630 million. Adjusted earnings are projected within 47 cents to 55 cents per share.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Plexus is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Plexus has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 51 cents. Though Plexus' Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a few companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Silicon Motion Technology Corp.  with Earnings ESP of +7.27% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Verisk Analytics, Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2Intel Corporation  with Earnings ESP of +4.08% and a Zacks Rank #3Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 18, after the market closes. Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.68%. Over the past four quarters, the company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.37%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.IBM had a tough 2015 given the ongoing and heavily time consuming business model transition to cloud. Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware along with foreign exchange volatility remain added concerns.We believe that revenues will continue to be affected in the near term as the company is currently transitioning to higher-growth markets that are not yielding enough to offset declines in traditional segments. Also, intensifying competition in the industry is a major headwind.Nevertheless, IBM's strategic growth initiatives, including its Big Data & business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth. In 2015, cloud, analytics, social, mobile and security revenues grew 17% over the last year and represented 35% of total revenue in the year. Cloud revenues grew 43%, business analytics revenues grew 7%, security business revenues increased 5% while mobile business registered a threefold jump. Reportedly, IBM estimates SoftLayer to generate $1 billion in revenues in 2016. SoftLayer is the primary infrastructure of IBM's cloud operations.In addition, IBM's policy of making strategic acquisitions (over 150 companies since 2000) will lead to incremental revenues, strengthening its technology leadership and resulting in a more favorable mix of business. The acquisitions have also increased its scale of operations globally. This year IBM has made 10 acquisitions so far, which include Bluewolf Group, Resilient Systems, Truven Health Analytics,Optevia and The Weather Company's B2B, mobile and cloud-based web-properties. Strong cash flow generation is expected to provide the financial flexibility required for strategic investments in the changing business environment.Our proven model does not conclusively show that IBM is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares Russell 1000 Low Beta Equal Weight Portfolio ETF (Symbol: USLB), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $27.07 per unit.With USLB trading at a recent price near $23.28 per unit, that means that analysts see 16.27% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of USLB's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are IMS Health Holdings Inc (Symbol: IMS), Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK), and IHS Inc (Symbol: IHS). Although IMS has traded at a recent price of $24.74/share, the average analyst target is 25.30% higher at $31.00/share. Similarly, VRSK has 21.80% upside from the recent share price of $68.22 if the average analyst target price of $83.09/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting IHS to reach a target price of $119.12/share, which is 21.36% above the recent price of $98.16. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of IMS, VRSK, and IHS:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"n Mar 11, Zacks  initiated the research report on business services provider  .Headquartered in Chicago, IL, TransUnion operates as a consumer information services firm that offers data and analytics solutions, particularly in credit risk management. The company is one of the three largest credit reporting agencies in the U.S. TransUnion boasts rich domain proficiency across a wide range of industry verticals, including insurance, healthcare and financial services. It also caters to verticals like wireless, real estate and general commercial/business information.The company's addressable market includes the rapidly rising Big Data and analytics market, which is expanding swiftly as companies are realizing the advantages of building an analytical enterprise where decisions are derived from data and insights. Numerous underlying trends are supporting this market growth, including the creation of massive amounts of data, advances in technology and analytics that allow data to be processed more swiftly and efficiently, and mounting demand for these business insights across industries and geographies.Research firm IDC projects that global spending on Big Data and analytics services will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (""CAGR"") of 23.1%, and will reach $48.6 billion in 2019. In order to capitalize on the immense growth potential of this market, TransUnion has leveraged its next-generation technology to strengthen its analytics capabilities and further expanded its database.The company's gigantic treasure trove of data is its most distinguishing asset and is also perhaps the biggest barrier to entry for competitors. TransUnion has over 30 petabytes of data, growing at an average of over 25% annually since 2010. Acquiring or building such data is difficult for a new company as it involves huge costs. This fortifies TransUnion's ability to sustain its competitive advantage and protect its market share.However, TransUnion's revenues are considerably influenced by the overall macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates, employment levels, consumer confidence, accessibility of affordable credit and capital, inflation and housing demand. Economic recovery has been fragile so far, and consumer spending growth has been limited. This continues to exert pressure on TransUnion. The company's revenues are also significantly affected by industry trends, including the demand for information services in insurance, financial services and healthcare industry. Adverse developments in the debt, consumer credit and financial services markets can hamper the company's growth.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. Some other stocks in the industry that are worth a look include McGraw Hill Financial, Inc.  , Verisk Analytics, Inc.  and Franklin Covey Co.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options begin trading this week, for the September 16th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new September 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $65.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.40/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $71.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.20% if the stock gets called away at the September 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

"Shutterstock photoV erisk Analytics has watched its stock price soar to new highs, again and again, after its quarterly earnings reports. The stock notched a new high a couple of weeks ago after the company reported second-quarter earnings. The same thing occurred after it posted first-quarter and 2014 fourth-quarter results.Verisk (  ) provides risk assessment services and decision analytics to professionals in a variety of fields, including property/casualty insurance, financial services, health care, government, human resources and energy -- the last of which it entered in May via the biggest acquisition in its history.The company has been on a pretty good roll of late, with three straight quarters of accelerated earnings gains.After the close on July 28, Verisk posted a 35% year-over-year earnings increase -- its biggest in at least a dozen quarters. Results easily surpassed consensus analyst views. The next day Verisk stock climbed 9% to a record high of 79.88 intraday before closing up 7% to 78.60.Similar spikes occurred on April 29, a day after Verisk reported Q1 results, and on Feb. 25, the day after it reported 2014 fourth-quarter earnings.How does Verisk view such stock action?""It's always interesting to try to understand that. Fundamentally, I'd say all of our verticals are doing well,"" said Eva Huston, Verisk's senior vice president and chief knowledge officer.In addition, she told IBD, the company has ""a lot of consistency"" in terms of financial performance.""Investors value that,"" she said.That consistency is partly the result of having expertise that spans more than 40 years.Verisk was founded in 1971 when Insurance Services Office, or ISO, launched operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry. The original business remains part of the company's Risk Assessment segment. Verisk also operates a Decision Analytics segment, which now makes up the bulk of the business.The Risk Assessment segment primarily helps property/casualty customers define, measure and manage risk via the flagship ISO subsidiary as well as several other units. The products and tools include data and statistical services, actuarial services, standardized insurance policy programs, underwriting information and rating-integrity tools.Its Decision Analytics segment provides a wide variety of customers with tools to help them make informed decisions about managing their assets and risk. These tools are used to predict future losses, select and price risk, detect and prevent fraud and quantify losses that have already happened.Decision Analytics Drive GrowthIn the second quarter, the Decision Analytics business posted a 24.6% revenue increase to $325.9 million, with more than half of the gain coming from the insurance sector. Revenue in the Risk Assessment segment grew 6% to $171.7 million.Total revenue for Verisk rose 17.5% to $497.6 million. Organic revenue, which excluded recent acquisitions and other items, grew 9.4% year over year.Verisk's second-quarter earnings came in at 77 cents a share, up 35.1% from a year earlier and well above consensus estimates for 66 cents.Much of Verisk's recent profit growth can be traced to what it calls a ""build it once, sell it many times"" revenue model, as well as investments the company has made in new solutions, Huston says.""Over the past few years we have been doing more investing in our business, thinking up new analytics to help customers run their businesses better,"" she said.Huston cites the company's investments into its new software platform called Touchstone. Touchstone is designed to perform advanced analytics to help companies better assess their risk.""That took a fair amount of investment, but it allows us to increase our revenue growth,"" Huston said. ""We are now providing a solution that might have been used in a small portion of the insurance industry before, but can now be used by underwriters and a wider portion of the industry.""Similar investments have been made in Verisk's aerial imagery tools. Among other things, these tools let insurance customers view structures from their computers to assess associated risk. This lets them avoid the time and cost of visiting the structures themselves.Verisk's biggest investment came in May, when it closed its $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie, a Scotland-based provider of data analytics and commercial intelligence for the energy, chemicals, metal and mining industries.One major benefit of the acquisition -- the biggest in Verisk's history -- is that it greatly expands the company's global footprint.""Wood Mackenzie has offices around the world -- in Tokyo, Hong Kong, China, Australia, all throughout Europe,"" Huston said. ""We can leverage that footprint into selling our existing solutions into those markets. For example, we have the opportunity to expand our footprint into China, where we didn't have a presence.""In a recent report, JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman noted that ""WoodMac has the ability to transform Verisk on the global front,"" though the acquisition ""bears risk due to its energy end market."" He also expects reinvestments in WoodMac ""to boost revenues over the medium term.""The deal has already paid bottom-line benefits, notes Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Arash Soleimani: ""Verisk's (Q2) outperformance relative to our estimate stemmed mostly from likely recurring tax benefits associated with WoodMac's UK domicile and higher-than-expected gross margins.""Meanwhile, Verisk continues to broaden its product lineup. On Aug. 5, it announced that its Verisk Insurance Solutions unit launched the ISO ClaimSearch mobile application available onApple 's (  ) iTunes andGoogle 's (  ) Google Play.The app gives subscribers, including adjusters and investigators, a new tool that provides real-time access to the company's database of claims.""ISO ClaimSearch mobile users will see instant search results to help them investigate and adjust claims more efficiently, whether they're on a roof, in a salvage yard, in a home, at a business, or at a catastrophe site,"" Carlos Martins, vice president and general manager of ISO ClaimSearch Solutions, said in a statement.Users will be able to securely access the claims inquiry function on ISO ClaimSearch via their iPhone, iPad or Android phone and tablet.Verisk has an IBD Composite Rating of 95. The company belongs to IBD's Commercial Services-Market Research group, which ranks No. 64 of 197 industries tracked. The group's biggest stocks by market cap areThomson Reuters (  ) andMoody's (  ).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@When Risk Firm Reports Earnings, Investors See Reward@2015-08-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/when-risk-firm-reports-earnings-investors-see-reward-2015-08-10
I know you have a relatively small position in Verisk Analytics. Just a question on the investment thesis, the valuation, capital allocation, and more specifically the Wood Mackenzie acquisition, which the company announced in March.I will try to be brief. Our position in Verisk (  ) rounds to 0.0% of the portfolio. So I would not consider it a real position. It is a great business. Verisk is basically becoming a platform for buying data analytics firms. Its core business in the insurance space has as big a moat as you are going to find anywhere but the returns on its expansion businesses, the jury is still out. The acquired businesses are good but the returns on those investments are not anywhere approaching the returns in its core business. It is probably not worth it to take any more time because we really do not have a material position.From  .Read More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

n Jul 6, 2015, Zacks  downgraded security and protection services provider  to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Despite the relative weakness, the stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 16.5x with long-term earnings growth expectation of 6.6%, which signify its inherent growth potential.ADT operates in the security alarm industry, which is highly fragmented due to the low barriers to entry. Consequently, it is facing significant pricing pressure and competition on factors like product installation, monitoring and service fees. In addition, cable and telecommunications companies are also eroding ADT's market share by expanding into the monitored security alarm industry and bundling their existing offerings with monitored security services. As such, ADT has to continually invest in R&D and similar other value drivers that act as a hedge against tough competition. This has increased its operating costs and reduced its profitability to some extent.In addition, most states and provinces in which ADT operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the security services industry. Increased government regulation escalates costs and restricts operations, somewhat impairing the long-term growth of its business.Furthermore, ADT's business strategy hinges on inorganic growth and making investments that complement its existing businesses. These acquisitions entail huge integration costs, which often become a drag on the profitability of the company. ADT also incurs significant upfront investments for expanding its customer base, including direct material and labor costs to install security and home/business automation systems, indirect sales costs, marketing costs and administrative costs related to installation activities. The economics of the installation business also varies depending on the customer acquisition channel. Consequently, ADT's long-term profitability is dependent on long customer tenure and minimal customer attrition. These often lead to margin contractions and reduce bottom-line growth.Over the last one-year period, ADT has performed relatively weaker in comparison to the overall S&P 500 with an average return of -2.6% compared to 5.0% for the benchmark index. A downgrade in the Zacks Rank serves as one of the triggers to exit certain underperformers at the right time to maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can at times be difficult, but with the continuous share price decline since mid-April, it seems to be an opportune time to get rid of this stock before more losses hit your portfolio.Some other stocks in the industry that look promising include FactSet Research Systems Inc.  , IHS Inc.  and Verisk Analytics, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"irroring the performance of 2014, the U.S. had an unenterprising start to 2015 as the economy contracted 0.2% in the first quarter. Reminiscent of the first quarter of 2014, when severe winter conditions led to a sharp contraction in the economy, the odds are currently staked pretty high for a similar rebound in the second half of 2015 as seen last year. Experts anticipate second-quarter 2015 GDP to grow in the vicinity of 2.7% and by 3% on an average in the second half of the year.On the surface, the disappointing first-quarter GDP data primarily appears to be the result of the fallout of the growing global malaise on domestic activity. Strong dollar appreciation and prevailing macroeconomic turmoil have adversely affected exports and led to sluggish corporate investment levels.Strong appreciation of the dollar has dented the export basket, as the U.S. goods and services have been rendered expensive upon foreign soil. Lower  have further added to the woes of the industries that directly or indirectly source businesses from the energy sector. While first quarter exports declined 5.9%, imports increased 7.1% on a year-over-year basis, leading to high negative balance of trade.Capital expenditures in businesses contracted 2% - the largest decline of this kind since the second quarter of 2009. Inflationary pressures remained muted in the first quarter as personal consumption expenditures price index fell 0.5% - the weakest since the first quarter of 2009. This is likely to provide the Fed with a perfect alibi to keep the interest rate at near zero levels until September.About 8.7% of the total S&P 500 companies in the Business Services sector have reported earnings results till Apr 15, 2015. With a 'beat ratio' of 50.0% and a median surprise of +3.7%, total earnings for these companies are up +3.4% year over year. Revenues increased +1.0% compared with the year-ago period, with solid revenue 'beat ratio' of 100.0% and a median surprise of +4.2%. The entire Business Services sector is expected to perform relatively better than the overall equity market with an earnings growth expectation of -0.6% in the second quarter versus -4.7% for the S&P 500 index.The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry hinge on a healthy economy with decent prospects for job growth, higher disposable income and new business initiatives. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers make the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.Given the lacklustre forecast, it might be a good idea to zero-in on a handful of Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise should help these stocks outperform in the near term.The Business Services sector covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. Amid a diverse range of companies in the Business Services arena, picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a colossal task. An easy way to narrow down the list is to look at stocks that have a solid Zacks Rank and a favorable Zacks  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP is usually a harbinger of an earnings beat and serves a perfect success formula on a platter. For investors seeking to benefit by applying this strategy to their portfolios, we have mentioned three Business Services stocks below, which match these criteria, and thus may be potential winners this earnings season. (  ): Based in Baltimore, MD, and founded in 1982, FTI Consulting provides specialized consulting services across varied foreign countries. The company has a team of highly qualified professionals, who provide problem-solving and technology services primarily to major corporations, financial institutions and law firms.The company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.0%. FTI Consulting currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 along with an Earnings ESP of +2.17%. The company is expected to report its second-quarter 2015 results before the opening bell on Jul 30. (  ): Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Global Payments operates as a provider of payment technology services. The company offers a comprehensive portfolio of processing solutions for credit and debit cards, business-to-business purchasing cards, gift cards, electronic check conversion and check guarantee, verification and recovery, as well as terminal management.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.1% and an Earnings ESP of +1.18%. The company is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results before the opening bell on Jul 28. (  ): Founded in 1865, Towers Watson offers consulting, technology and solutions in the areas of benefits, talent management, rewards, and risk and capital management. Based in Arlington, VA, the company operates as a premier global professional services firm with a technical know-how and breadth of experience to help professionals reach their goals.The company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.8%. Towers Watson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 along with an Earnings ESP of +1.42%. The company is expected to report its fourth-quarter 2015 results on Aug 11. (  ): Headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, Verisk operates as a provider of information about risk to professionals in insurance, healthcare, financial services, government, supply chain, and risk management across the globe. The company offers analytics and decision support solutions in fraud prevention, actuarial science, insurance coverages, fire protection, data management and weather risk.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.3% and an Earnings ESP of +1.52%. The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2015 results after the closing bell on Jul 28.Morgan Stanley economist Ted Wieseman perfectly summed up: ""We're optimistic the stronger recent consumer spending indications represent the start of a more robust run reflecting a delayed spending of earlier gas savings amid generally positive consumer wealth, debt and income fundamentals."" As the U.S. stocks look to gain solidarity with a healthy rebound in the economy, a sneak peek to the space for some possible outperformers backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP could be a great idea for investors to gain from this earnings season.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

he business services sector provides ancillary services to firms in various other sectors in the marketplace. Hence, the core business of one company in this sector can be a business service for another.Operating efficiencies demand companies to focus on functions and activities that are close to their core competence. This not only helps them reap the benefits of economies of scale in those core functions, but also improves their competitive positioning. Importantly, this dynamism opens the door to many business services companies.The fortunes of business service operators are closely tied to the health of the broader economy. As per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.4% pace in 2014. Following a contraction of 7% in the first quarter, the U.S. GDP is back on growth track with expected improvement by nearly 2% in the second quarter. The growth momentum expected to accelerate this year by 2.2% and the next by 2.6%.This improving outlook for the U.S. economy is therefore a net positive for the sector. The bureau also estimates total industrial production to grow by 1.5% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016, thus offering opportunities for growth and expansion of business service providers. Moreover, a projected rise in expenditure should also lend support to the business service sector.Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are relatively conservatively managed, with a large number of sharing their excess cash with shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Nonetheless, the business service sector is highly fragmented, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. As per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to overall revenue. However, given its unique nature, Zacks has classified the group as one of 16 sectors (the S&P's official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the 'Industrials' sector).This industry covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenue of about $620 billion, though many companies mentioned below do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry.Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries (at the medium or M-level) and 258 industries at the expanded or X-level. We rank all 258 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 258 industries is by dividing it into positive, neutral and negative categories depending on the Zacks Rank. The outlook for the top one-third of the list (Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third of the list (Rank of #89 to #176) is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Rank #177 and higher) is a clear negative.Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks that is the core of our Industry Rank, has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (1 to 3 months). We have 7 X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely, Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services:Auction/Valuation Services at Zacks Rank #16, Consulting at Rank #63, Staffing #36, Business Information Services #75 and Financial Transaction Services at #72 fall in the upper 1/3 and have a positive outlook.Outsourcing at #157 and Waste Removal at #172 are positioned in the mid 1/3 of all Zacks industries and have a neutral outlook.Business Services at #181 falls in the bottom 1/3 of all Zacks industries and has a negative outlook.This distribution of industry ranks within the sector shows that the overall sector has a positive to neutral outlook.Our top picks from the Consulting Industry are Accenture plc (  ), while from the Staffing Industry we pick Heidrick & Struggles International Inc. (  ) and On Assignment Inc. (  ). We also favor Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. (  ) from the Auction/Valuation Services and Verisk Analytics, Inc. (  ) from Business Information Services industry. Global Payments Inc. (  ), Green Dot Corp. (  ) and Total System Services, Inc. (  ) from Financial Transaction Services are in our basket of favorites. All these stocks presently carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In the first quarter of 2015, earnings for the business sector show 7.1% growth, faring better than the overall 2.4% growth for the S&P 500.Revenues show an improvement of 0.7%, faring much better than the S&P 500's year-over-year average of negative 3.2%.As the second quarter earnings releases are due in the next few weeks, let's have a look at how the sector might deliver. Earnings are expected to decline 1.8% with revenues decreasing 2.3%. However, both these are expected to outperform the S&P 500 which is projected to see earnings decline of 7.3% and revenue decline of 6.1%.The graph below shows year-over-year bottom-line growth of the business service (BS) sector in comparison to the S&P 500.The graph below shows year-over-year top-line growth of the business service (BS) sector in comparison to the S&P 500.Nonetheless, the sector will be back on its growth track in 2015 and 2016. For 2015 and 2016, earnings are expected to improve 6.8% and 12.7%, respectively. This compares favorably with the expected 0.8% for 2015 and 11.8% for 2016 for the S&P 500.Revenue growth is expected at 0.1% for 2015 and 5.7% for 2016 for the sector compared with a decline of 5.6% and an improvement of 6.0% for the respective years for the S&P 500.

n Sep 8, Zacks  updated the research report on security and protection services provider  .With a wide array of products to cater to a broad spectrum of customer needs, ADT has a strong footprint in the large and growing residential and small business security market. The product portfolio of the company includes some of the most respected, trusted and well-known brands in the industry. As reputation and reliability serve as the two key elements in the decision-making process while purchasing home and small business security and automation services, ADT has a distinct advantage over rivals with its well-recognized and reliable brands.Additionally, ADT continues to add new features and capabilities to its Pulse platform to ensure that the product continues to be the best home security and automation solution in the industry. The depth in product portfolio, strong brand identity and a well-diversified customer base offer an unrivalled competitive advantage to ADT.A bulk of the monitoring and home/business automation services and a large portion of the maintenance services are governed by multi-year contracts with automatic renewal provisions, which generate significant recurring revenue for ADT. This insulates the company from the volatility in the market and enables it to invest for a healthy organic and inorganic growth. The company has also improved customer retention by heavily investing in its Pulse platform.Moving forward, ADT envisions significant growth potential by leveraging on its efficient operating model and lower technology costs over time. These would then enable the company to considerably reduce the cost of basic installation and services, thereby making it affordable for a wider market acceptance by a larger portion of households and businesses.However, ADT faces significant pricing pressure and competition as the security alarm industry is highly fragmented due to low barriers to entry. The company also witnesses significant competitive pricing pressures on installation, monitoring and service fees. In addition, cable and telecommunications companies are eroding its market share by expanding into the monitored security alarm industry and bundling their existing offerings with monitored security services. As such, ADT has to continually invest in R&D and similar other value drivers that act as a hedge against tough competition. This increases its operating costs and reduces its profitability to some extent.Nevertheless, we remain encouraged with such inherent growth prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Other stocks that look promising and are worth a look now in the industry include Nielsen Holdings plc  , Verisk Analytics, Inc.  and Accenture plc  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 recently announced that Valcon Acquisition Holding (Luxembourg), its selling stockholder, intends to make an underwritten secondary offering of 8.96 million shares.The shares will be sold by stockholders affiliated to The Carlyle Group and The Blackstone Group. Consequently, Nielsen will not obtain any proceeds from the offering which is expected to be priced at $44.51 per share. Goldman, Sachs & Co. will act as the underwriter for the note offering.Also, in March, Nielsen's subsidiaries priced a secondary offering of 8 million shares at $45.21 a share. The proceeds are likely to be used for share repurchases, reducing outstanding amount under its revolving credit facility, paying related fees and expenses and general corporate purposes.Nielsen Holdings is an information and measurement company which provides media and marketing information and analytics about what consumers watch (consumer interaction with television, online and mobile) and buy on a global as well as local basis. In the recently reported first-quarter 2015, Nielsen's net debt position came in at $7.0 billion and net debt leverage ratio was 3.80x. The company had a cash balance of approximately $343 million versus $273 million in the prior quarter.The company's revenues decreased 10% sequentially and 2.1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.46 billion. The decrease was due to weakness in the Buy segment and unfavorable foreign currency. Also, earnings of 43 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Currently, Nielsen has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks that have been performing well are Verisk Analytics, Inc.  , FactSet Research Systems Inc.  and Morningstar Inc.  . While Verisk Analytics sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), FactSet Research and Morningstar have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise nearly 6% on the day. The upside was driven by the company's announcement of better-than-expected first-quarter 2015 results. This led to solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. Yesterday's rally breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $71.16 to $72.94 in the past one-month time frame.In the last 30 days, the company witnessed one positive estimate revision and the Zacks Consensus Estimate also moved higher over the same time frame, suggesting that more solid trading could be ahead for Verisk Analytics. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward to see if yesterday's jump can turn into more strength down the road.Verisk Analytics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another well-ranked stock in the business info services industry is National Research Corp.

ooking back to 37 days ago, Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) priced a 9,640,000 share secondary stock offering at $70.00 per share. Buyers in that offering made a considerable investment into the company, expecting that their investment would go up over the course of time and based on early trading on Friday, the stock is now 5.7% higher than the offering price.Investors who did not participate in the offering but would be a buyer of VRSK at a cheaper price, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $65 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.00. That would result in a cost basis of $64.00 per share before broker commissions in the scenario where the contract is exercised. If the contract is never exercised, the put seller would still keep the premium, which represents a 1.5% return against the $65.00 purchase commitment, or a 3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Secondaries can often present buying opportunities for bullish investors interested in purchasing shares, because the sudden extra supply of stock tends to require that the offering be priced at an attractive discount to where the stock had previously been trading before the offering announcement. That can also introduce near-term volatility which improves the premiums a put seller can achieve. Selling a put does not give an investor access to VRSK's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. The chart below shows the one year performance of VRSK shares, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, VRSK's low point in its 52 week range is $57.97 per share, with $78.09 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $74.26.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, VRSK makes up 1.70% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Ex-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQXT) which is trading lower by about 0.6% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Use Options For a Chance To Buy VRSK at a 14% Discount@2015-06-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/use-options-chance-buy-vrsk-14-discount-2015-06-12

"nvestors in Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) saw new options become available this week, for the December 18th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the VRSK options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $67.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of VRSK, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $72.47/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.71% return on the cash commitment, or 5.67% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $75.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of VRSK stock at the current price level of $72.47/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.87% if the stock gets called away at the December 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if VRSK shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Verisk Analytics Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing VRSK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.38% boost of extra return to the investor, or 5.16% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 19%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 18%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $72.47) to be 15%.

he business services sector provides ancillary services to firms in various other sectors in the marketplace. Hence, the core business of one company in this sector can be a business service for another.Operating efficiencies demand companies to focus on functions and activities that are close to their core competence. This not only helps them reap the benefits of economies of scale in those core functions, but also improves their competitive positioning. Importantly, this dynamism opens the door to many business services companies.The fortunes of business service operators are closely tied to the health of the broader economy. As per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.4% pace in 2014. Following a contraction of 7% in the first quarter, the U.S. GDP is back on growth track with expected improvement by nearly 2% in the second quarter. The growth momentum expected to accelerate this year by 2.2% and the next by 2.6%.This improving outlook for the U.S. economy is therefore a net positive for the sector. The bureau also estimates total industrial production to grow by 1.5% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2016, thus offering opportunities for growth and expansion of business service providers. Moreover, a projected rise in expenditure should also lend support to the business service sector.Economic sensitivity aside, business service companies are relatively conservatively managed, with a large number of sharing their excess cash with shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Nonetheless, the business service sector is highly fragmented, with no single service provider enjoying market dominance. As per business reports, the top 50 companies of the sector contribute less than 25% to overall revenue. However, given its unique nature, Zacks has classified the group as one of 16 sectors (the S&P's official GIC classification has only 10 sectors where business services are grouped within the 'Industrials' sector).This industry covers an array of services that include marketing, consulting, staffing, security, telecommunications, Internet services, logistics and waste handling. In its expanded sense, the U.S. business services sector generates consolidated yearly revenue of about $620 billion, though many companies mentioned below do not strictly fall within the generally accepted definition of the industry.Within the Zacks Industry classification, we have divided the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 industries (at the medium or M-level) and 258 industries at the expanded or X-level. We rank all 258 X-level industries in the 16 sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 258 industries is by dividing it into positive, neutral and negative categories depending on the Zacks Rank. The outlook for the top one-third of the list (Rank of #88 and lower) is positive, the middle one-third of the list (Rank of #89 to #176) is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Rank #177 and higher) is a clear negative.Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks that is the core of our Industry Rank, has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, in particular over the short term (1 to 3 months). We have 7 X-level industries within the Business Services sector, namely, Auction/Valuation Services, Business Information Services:Auction/Valuation Services at Zacks Rank #16, Consulting at Rank #63, Staffing #36, Business Information Services #75 and Financial Transaction Services at #72 fall in the upper 1/3 and have a positive outlook.Outsourcing at #157 and Waste Removal at #172 are positioned in the mid 1/3 of all Zacks industries and have a neutral outlook.Business Services at #181 falls in the bottom 1/3 of all Zacks industries and has a negative outlook.This distribution of industry ranks within the sector shows that the overall sector has a positive to neutral outlook.Our top picks from the Consulting Industry are Accenture plc (  ), while from the Staffing Industry we pick Heidrick & Struggles International Inc. (  ) and On Assignment Inc. (  ). We also favor Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. (  ) from the Auction/Valuation Services and Verisk Analytics, Inc. (  ) from Business Information Services industry. Global Payments Inc. (  ), Green Dot Corp. (  ) and Total System Services, Inc. (  ) from Financial Transaction Services are in our basket of favorites. All these stocks presently carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In the first quarter of 2015, earnings for the business sector show 7.1% growth, faring better than the overall 2.4% growth for the S&P 500.Revenues show an improvement of 0.7%, faring much better than the S&P 500's year-over-year average of negative 3.2%.As the second quarter earnings releases are due in the next few weeks, let's have a look at how the sector might deliver. Earnings are expected to decline 1.8% with revenues decreasing 2.3%. However, both these are expected to outperform the S&P 500 which is projected to see earnings decline of 7.3% and revenue decline of 6.1%.The graph below shows year-over-year bottom-line growth of the business service (BS) sector in comparison to the S&P 500.The graph below shows year-over-year top-line growth of the business service (BS) sector in comparison to the S&P 500.Nonetheless, the sector will be back on its growth track in 2015 and 2016. For 2015 and 2016, earnings are expected to improve 6.8% and 12.7%, respectively. This compares favorably with the expected 0.8% for 2015 and 11.8% for 2016 for the S&P 500.Revenue growth is expected at 0.1% for 2015 and 5.7% for 2016 for the sector compared with a decline of 5.6% and an improvement of 6.0% for the respective years for the S&P 500.

isk lurks everywhere. And it can be incredibly profitable -- as long as it can be identified, forecast, and tracked. So decades ago, Warren Buffett joined a consortium of America's biggest insurers to create a risk lab that can do just that.That number crunching consulting firm,  , has proven vitally important to Buffett given that some of his biggest -- and most successful -- investments have been insurers that rely heavily on quantitative analysis to model pricing and profit.Verisk remained behind-the-scenes for years, but as the walls separating insurance and banking were torn down (Glass Steagall) and increasingly complex financial instruments were developed and sold to insurers (CDOs/CMOs), Verisk grew big enough that the consortium was able to spin it off to raise cash to bolster sagging balance sheets during the great recession.Today, Verisk's data mining solutions are used by all 100 of the country's largest property and casualty insurers and that means that Verisk has a hand in pricing as much as 85% of the $540 billion in P&C premiums written annually. But it's not just P&C insurers that are embracing Verisk's solutions, it also doing big business with banks and healthcare companies, too.Buffett's deep pockets allowed him to hold onto his stake in Verisk following its IPO and that has -- unsurprisingly -- paid off for the Oracle of Omaha. Since going public, Verisk has generated an impressive 127% return for Warren and his partner Charlie Munger.That return reflects growing post-recession demand for Verisk's solutions, including new, adjacent markets like healthcare, where reform and rising costs are leading to quantitative approaches displacing empirical (and often subjective) practices and processes.That shift has led to Verisk inking contracts with nine of the top 10 largest health insurers -- Verisk competes with  's Optum unit -- and a variety of health care providers and employers, resulting in health care sales climbing from just $50 million in 2009 to $270 million in 2013.As a result, Verisk's total sales have grown a compounded 12% annually since 2004, rising from $540 million to nearly $1.6 billion last year. An expanding client base has also (importantly) reduced the company's reliance on its legacy P&C clients, which represented 80% of its sales in 2004, but represent just 47% of sales today. ) data by But it's not just growing demand for its products and services that's likely impressing Buffett. It's also a business model that allows Verisk to build-it-once and sell-it-many-times. That means that Verisk operates a highly scaleable, and profit-friendly, business that gets about 75% of its revenue from bottom-line boosting subscriptions.As a result, even as the company's revenue has accelerated in the past five years, with annualized growth north of 15%, capital spending to revenue has remained south of 10% and EBITDA margin has remained solid, at roughly 47%.Verisk's success has enabled the company to kick off more than $300 million in free cash flow in each of the past three years, contributing to shareholder friendly share buybacks, bolt-on acquisitions, and earnings growth.Verisk has returned roughly $1.4 billion to investors through share repurchases since 2009, including $279 million last year. Additionally, the company has been able to finance more than $1.2 billion in acquisitions that expand its product line-up. Overall, Verisk's shareholder friendly behavior seems to be just what Buffett is looking for given that his stake remains unchanged at 1.5 million shares. If so, investors might want to warm up to Buffett's approach to risk and consider Verisk, too. At the recent Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett admitted this emerging technology is threatening his biggest cash-cow. Buffett's fear can be your gain.

Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expenses.Nielsen reported revenues of $1.46 billion, down 10% sequentially and 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.

hares of Verisk Analytics, Inc. (  ), a provider of data and analytics to insurance, healthcare and financial end markets, declined in the first quarter on reports of subdued fourth quarter results.

n Feb 19, 2014 we issued an updated research report on  (  ). Ever since McGraw Hill posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2013 results and provided an upbeat guidance for 2014 (on Feb 4), the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been trending upwards. Stellar performance across all segments except the Standard & Poor's Ratings Services was the driving factor. Further, since the earnings release, the stock has garnered a return of nearly 4.7%.The company's top and bottom lines of $1,250 million and 81 cents easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while rising 2% and 12% respectively, year over year. Following the strong performance, McGraw Hill now projects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.75-$3.85 per share. Further, the company anticipates revenue growth in mid single digits in 2014, and is likely to generate free cash flow worth $1 billion.Consequently, for 2014, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved to $3.80 from $3.76 and for 2015, it has risen to $4.30 from $4.27, over the last 30 days.Further, McGraw Hill is an attractive pick for investors seeking both growth and income, as the company announced a dividend hike on Jan 29, 2014. Moreover, it raised its quarterly dividend by 7.1% to 30 cents per share (or $1.20 annually) from 28 cents (or $1.12 annually). The new payout will be given on Mar 12, 2014 to stockholders of record on Feb 26.Also, McGraw-Hill, which competes with  (  ), now seems to be well positioned to focus on high margin business after it offloaded the Education segment and Aviation week. The company is now concentrating on more on core financial areas that would help it emerge as a leader in rating provider, benchmark provider, and analytics in the global capital and commodity markets.Further, McGraw-Hill is likely to benefit from its strategic investments such as formation of S&P Dow Jones Indices coupled with the S&P Capital IQ's acquisitions of Credit Market Analysis, QuantHouse, R2 Financial Technologies and TheMarkets.com along with a significant stake (68%) in India's leading rating agency CRISIL as it positions to grab a wider market share.Mc Graw Hill currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other stocks worth considering in the financial services sector include  (  ) and  (  ).

"n the latest look at stocks ordered by largest market capitalization, Russell 3000 component Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Red Hat Inc (Symbol: RHT), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK), the market cap is now $11.08B, versus Red Hat Inc (Symbol: RHT) at $11.07B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VRSK vs. RHT:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, VRSK and RHT collectively make up 1.45% of the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF (  ) which is up by about 0.8% on the day Thursday.At the closing bell, VRSK is up about 4.1%, while RHT is up about 1.3% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Verisk Analytics Moves Up In Market Cap Rank, Passing Red Hat@2014-02-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/verisk-analytics-moves-market-cap-rank-passing-red-hat-2014-02-13

ecurity and protection services provider  (  ) recently announced a 60% year-over-year hike to its dividend payout. The quarterly dividend now comes to 20 cents or 80 cents per share on an annualized basis. The increased cash dividend is payable on Feb 19 to shareholders of record as of Jan 29.Based on the closing price of $39.08 on Jan 10, 2014, the proposed dividend translates into a yield of 2.0%. A steady dividend payout is part of the long-term strategy of ADT to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. The company has paid a steady dividend ever since its inception as a standalone listed firm in Oct 2012.Headquartered in Boca Raton, Fla, ADT offers electronic security products along with a wide range of interactive home and business automation and monitoring services for residences and small businesses in the U.S. and Canada.ADT's electronic security and home/business automation solutions primarily include installation and monitoring of residential and small business security and premises automation systems. These products are designed to detect intrusion; control access; react to movement, smoke, carbon monoxide, flooding, temperature and other environmental conditions and hazards; and address personal emergencies, such as, injuries, medical emergencies or incapacitation.ADT has a single operating segment. The products and services of the company comprise ADT Pulse interactive home and business solutions, home health services, and monitoring center supported personal emergency response system products and services.

n Jan 8, we initiated our coverage on  (  ) with a Neutral recommendation. The sideline stance is based on its balanced business model with a diversified product portfolio and customer base, while the stock remains vulnerable to gross margin pressures and stringent government laws and regulations.With a wide array of products to cater to a broad spectrum of customer needs, ADT has a strong footprint in the large and growing residential and small business security market. The product portfolio of the company includes some of the most respected, trusted and well-known brands in the industry. As reputation and reliability serve as the two key elements in the decision-making process while purchasing home and small business security and automation services, ADT has a distinct advantage over rivals with its well-recognized and reliable brands. The depth in product portfolio, strong brand identity and a well-diversified customer base offer an unrivalled competitive advantage to ADT.The company believes monitored security and home/business automation services remain under-penetrated in North American households. In addition, rising concerns about crime and security issues (especially by an aging population), increasing customer interest in lifestyle and business productivity, and technology advancements are likely to support the higher penetration of interactive services and home/business automation. As such, the company envisions significant growth potential and intends to capitalize on this opportunity by leveraging on its efficient operating model and lower technology costs over time. These would then enable the company to considerably reduce the cost of basic installation and services, thereby making it affordable for a wider market acceptance by a larger portion of households and businesses. We remain encouraged with such inherent growth prospects of the company.A bulk of the monitoring and home/business automation services and a large portion of the maintenance services are governed by multi-year contracts with automatic renewal provisions, which generate significant recurring revenues for ADT. This insulates the company from the volatility in the market and enables it to invest for a healthy organic and inorganic growth. Mergers and acquisitions continue to play a pivotal role in ADT's growth over the years. Periodic investments for improvement of the direct sales force and complementary distribution channels should also enable ADT to retain and capture additional market share to fuel its growth engine.On the flip side, ADT faces significant pricing pressure and competition as the security alarm industry is highly fragmented due to low barriers to entry. The company witnesses significant competitive pricing pressures on installation, monitoring and service fees. In addition, cable and telecommunications companies are also eroding its market share by expanding into the monitored security alarm industry and bundling their existing offerings with monitored security services. As such, ADT has to continually invest in R&D and similar other value drivers that act as a hedge against tough competition. This increases its operating costs and reduces its profitability to some extent.In addition, the operations of the company are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and Canada in areas such as consumer protection, occupational licensing, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax and other laws and regulations. In addition, most states and provinces in which ADT operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the security services industry. Increased government regulation escalates costs and restricts operations, somewhat impairing the long-term growth of its business.ADT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other stocks that are worth a look in the industry include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@ADT Initiated at Neutral - Analyst Blog@2014-01-09@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/adt-initiated-at-neutral-analyst-blog-2014-01-09
e suggest investors stay invested in security and protection services provider  (  ) based on a relatively balanced view. The stock at present neither calls for a bullish take nor a hurried sell-off.

Increased government regulation escalates costs and restricts operations, somewhat impairing the long-term growth of its business.ADT's first quarter fiscal 2014 results also failed to impress. GAAP net income declined to $77 million or 39 cents per share from $105 million or 44 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to high operating costs and interest expense stemming from its status as a standalone public company.With a mix of both positive and negative factors, we currently maintain our Neutral recommendation on the stock.

iven the recent run-up in the market, here's a screen I've been using recently for my own stock picking.First, it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries. Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buys and Holds, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And that's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:We're screening for only those stocks with the best (lowest) average Zacks Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sectors give us the best 50% of sectors.Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru. Since there are 264 'X' or expanded industries we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru. If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it's outside of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s. No Sells or Strong Sells (Zacks Rank #4s and #5s) allowed.Only stocks over $5 with at least an average of 100,0000 shares traded daily will be considered.This means we're screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.Then finally we're scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market, they increased in price less than their peers.So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector. This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks, you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from.And from that list of winners, we're selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list. Remember, these stocks aren't 'dogs' or unresponsive stocks. Quite the contrary; they have all outperformed the market. It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list. But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry, we've singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It's an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names.Here are 5 from that list: The Laclede Group Steven Madden Universal Health Services Verisk Analytics Wintrust FinancialAll great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test. It can all be done with the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting software.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Top Stocks with Big Potential Catch-Up Moves - Screen of the Week@2013-11-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-stocks-big-potential-catch-moves-screen-week-2013-11-05

"Shutterstock photoBig Data is a big buzz word. But it's nothing new or trendy to Verisk Analytics.The New Jersey-based risk-information firm has been collecting and analyzing data for decades.""We were Big Data before Big Data was popular,"" said Chief Executive Frank Coyne.Verisk (  ) was founded as a non-profit agency in 1971 to provide data for owner insurance firms, such asTravelers (  ),American International Group (  ) andHartford (  ).It expanded into analytics as it built ever larger databases -- the equivalent now of some 2 petabytes of data. That's a lot of data: 1 petabyte equals 1 quadrillion bytes, or 1,000 terabytes.Using that data, the company's decision analytics business helps customers predict future losses, price risk, detect fraud and quantify losses that have already occurred.""Data doesn't get us anything; we need to analyze it. And Verisk is good at building the software to analyze data,"" said UBS analyst Jennifer Huang. ""Once they have built the software they sell it multiple times to different customers.""The majority of Verisk's revenue is subscription based.Verisk is the leading supplier by far of risk assessment and analytics to the commercial property and casualty industry. It's the go-to source for more than 90% of property and casualty insurers.The industry's five-year down cycle has been turning up lately and should generate more revenue for Verisk over the next few years, analysts say.But Verisk still grew during the soft cycle because of its diversified offerings, such as helping insurers project losses from storms.Verisk also sells mortgage products to large underwriters, such asJPMorgan Chase (  ), leveraging its huge database on commercial properties.But that business hasn't been growing much. Management expects to see longer-term opportunities as the real estate market stabilizes.In more recent years, Verisk has been growing its presence in a faster growing area: health care data and analytics, largely by way of acquisitions.Last year's included Bloodhound Technologies, which helps health care payers combat fraud through real-time pre-adjudication claims editing, and Health Risk Partners, focused on Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans.On March 30, Verisk paid $348 million for MediConnect Global, which sells systems and services to facilitate the aggregation and analysis of medical records. That buy will start showing up in results in the second quarter.""Verisk fits into the center of two important trends in technology,"" said analyst James Friedman of Susquehanna Financial. ""One is analytics and the other is outsourcing.""He figures Verisk's total addressable market adds up to $8 billion with health-care analytics the biggest at $5 billion.Health care is still a relatively small portion of Verisk's business, but first-quarter revenue in that area nearly doubled from last year to $30.4 million. Customers include health insurers, such asHumana (HUM), among others.Verisk's overall revenue in the quarter totaled $346.5 million, up 10.7% from last year. Profit grew 18% to 47 cents a share.In health care, Verisk is a small but growing fish in a big pond, competing with larger players, such as the data and analytics unit of health insurerUnitedHealth Group (UNH) and the tech solutions division ofMcKesson (MCK).Another rival is Truven Health Analytics, the renamed former data and analytics unit of Thomson Reuters, which private equity firm Veritas Capital recently bought for $1.25 billion.Despite its four-decade history, Verisk didn't break into the spotlight until 2009, when it went public in an initial offering that at the time was the largest domestic debut sinceVisa's (V)a year earlier.It raised $1.9 billion after pricing 10% above its midpoint range, and closed the first day up nearly 24%, to 27.22. Shares were last trading around 47.""The stock has been one of the best performing stocks in the information service sector,"" said Huang. ""Investors like it because the business model is subscription based, the revenue stream is very predictable and they respect the management team.""Coyne has led the team since 1999, when he arrived to help transition Verisk to a for-profit firm.One large shareholder, Warren Buffett'sBerkshire Hathaway (BRKA), still owns 5.2 million shares, or 3.2% of the company's total even after taking some profits in recent months.The firm's flagship operating unit is known as ISO, which refers to the company's former name, Insurance Services Office. ISO has many databases, including a vast commercial property database.""The insurance companies have come out of a soft cycle, so that's a tail wind for Verisk for two reasons,"" Huang said. ""As they become more profitable, they tend to spend more on decision analytics. And in risk assessment, Verisk charges fees based on insurance premiums. So when pricing on insurance policies goes up, it means Verisk's revenues go up.""In the first quarter, commercial insurance prices rose nearly 5% over the earlier year, according to Towers Watson, the professional services consulting firm.But Verisk won't see the benefits of higher premiums on its subscription business until next year because it prices services based on the industry's prior year premiums.Verisk's fee-based part of its analytics business, however, is already seeing gains as customers ramp up projects as profits improve.Verisk's decision analytics business, which includes subscription and fee-based projects, accounted for 58% of first-quarter revenue. It grew 17% over the prior year.The remaining risk assessment business, all insurance related, rose 3%. ""It's low growth but it's steady and high margin,"" Huang said.Analysts expect full-year earnings to grow 12% to 15% annually through at least 2014, according to Thomson Reuters. They see total revenue rising 13% this year to $1.5 billion.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Verisk Tooled Big Data Before Big Data Was Popular@2012-06-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/verisk-tooled-big-data-big-data-was-popular-2012-06-26
"n this instance, Warren is Warren Buffett, the world's best stock picker, one of the richest people on the planet. He owns a great deal of Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company with many other companies in its portfolio. He's a legend in his own time, a well-deserved legend.With all the major market turmoil, most investors would love to sit down with Mr. Buffett and ask him many questions. That's not possible, though you can bid on an annual lunch with the Oracle of Omaha. The last person to pay for such a privilege ate for $2.6 million. You and I are probably not going to be dining with Mr. Buffett. The main queston most of us want to know: What is Mr. Buffett doing in these difficult times?The answer, thankfully, is given every quarter. It's the report his company files with the SEC that shows his holdings and those of Berkshire Hathaway. This is what he's doing:Buying: Dollar General (DG-NYSE) This is a new position. There were 1,497,800 shares added to the portfolio. Dollar General is a discount retailer of general merchandise with stores mostly in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern U.S.Mastercard (MA-NYSE) These shares almost doubled to 405,000, up from 216,000 in the last quarter. Mastercard processes credit card payments and is paid a fee for doing it.Verisk Analytics, Inc. (VRSK-NASDAQ) This is a new position totaling 2,101,125 shares. The company provides proprietary data, analytics methods, and embedded decision support solutions to property and casualty (P&C) insurance, mortgage, and healthcare industries primarily in the United States. One of the largest parts of Berkshire Hathaway is Property & Casualty insurance.Selling: Kraft Foods (KFT-NYSE) Mr. Buffett voiced some concerns about Kraft buying Cadbury. He did more than talk. He sold about 6 million shares in the last quarter, taking his position to 99,467,624 shares from 105,210,000 shares.Positions that were unchanged:American Express (AXP); Bank of New York Mellon (BK); Coca Cola (KO); Comdisco Holdings (CDCO-NASDAQ); ConocoPhillips (COP-NYSE); Costco Wholesale (COST-NASDAQ); Exxon Mobil (XOM-NYSE);Gannett co. (GCI-NYSE); General Electric Corp.(GE-NYSE); GlaxoSmithKline (GSK-NYSE); Ingersoll-Rand (IR-NYSE); Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-NYSE); Lubrizol (LZ-NYSE); M&T Bank Corp. (MTB-NYSE); Moody's Corp. (MCO-NYSE); Procter & Gamble (PG-NYSE); Sanofi-Aventis (SNY-NYSE); Torchmark (TMK-NYSE); US Bancorp (USB-NYSE); USG Corp. (USG-NYSE); United Parcel Service (UPS-NYSE); Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT-NYSE).Most of these positions (with the exceptions of the 2 new ones) have been owned for decades. Notice they are all very large companies, mostly highly recognizable names. Mr. Buffett likes to buy stocks which he describes as having a ""moat"". In his lexicon, that means the company has a strong brand or patents that make it almost unassailable by competitors. A great example is Coca-Cola, a stock he's owned for many years. As he once said: my favorite holding period is forever.What would Warren do? It's easily answered from looking at his actions. He would buy stocks that he sees as attractive, even in very bad markets. And he wouldn't sell unless he had a specific reason. The strategy has worked wonders for him. Probably work well for all of us.- Ted AllrichAugust 16, 2011The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@What Would Warren Do?@2011-08-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-would-warren-do-2011-08-16
Shutterstock photo wrote an analysis of Verisk Analytics (  ) to  before pricing and open. In its market debut Wednesday, October 7, the company priced 85.25 million shares at $22 a share, above its $19-$21 estimated price range.The text of Mr. Simpson's original writeup follows:• • •Verisk Analytics plans on offering 85.25 million shares in a range of $19-$21. Insiders will be selling all of the shares in this deal, VRSK will receive no monies. If over-allotments are exercised, insiders will be offering 12.75 million shares, bringing the total deal size to 98 million shares. BofA/Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are leading the deal, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, William Blair, Fox-Pitt Kelton and KBW co-managing. Post-ipo VRSK will have 180 million shares outstanding for a market cap of $3.6 billion on a pricing of $20.Travelers Insurance (  ) will own 15% of VRSK post-ipo, Berhshire Hathaway (  ) 10%. A number of insurance companies own a piece of VRSK stock. In addition, VRSK's employee stock ownership plan will own 20% of VRSK post-ipo.From the  :VRSK is the largest aggregator and provider of detailed actuarial and underwriting data pertaining to U.S. property and casualty, or P&C, insurance risks. Insurers utilize VRSK to make better risk decisions and to price risk appropriately.VRSK insurance risk management framework: 1)Prediction of Loss; 2)Selection and Pricing of Risk; 3)Detection and Prevention of Fraud, and 4)Quantification of Loss.There are two segments: Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics.Risk Assessment - The leading provider of statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the U.S. P&C insurance industry. Largest P&C insurance database includes over 14 billion records, and, in each of the past three years, VRSK updated the database with over 2 billion validated new records. VRSK uses this data to create industry standard policy language and proprietary risk classifications and to generate prospective loss cost estimates used to price insurance policies. - VRSK has a data set that includes over 600 million P&C insurance claims, historic natural catastrophe data covering more than 50 countries, data from more than 13 million applications for mortgage loans and over 312 million U.S. criminal records. Customers utilize this data, along with VRSK's proprietary algorithms, to predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes and earthquakes to unanticipated healthcare claims. VRSK is the leading developer of catastrophe and extreme event models.**Not only are nearly all the major US property & casualty insurers VRSK shareholders, the company's solutions are actually embedded into their customers' critical decision processes. VRSK is pretty much the only game in town when it comes to risk management for US property and casualty insurance firms. Would be an understatement here to state barriers to entry are high.VRSK also has a large presence outside of property and casualty:U.S. customers included all of the top 100 P&C insurance providers, four of the 10 largest Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, four of the six leading mortgage insurers, 14 of the top 20 mortgage lenders, and the 10 largest global reinsurers. Over the past three years, VRSK has retained 98% of all customers.97% of top 100 customers had been customers for each of the past five years. VRSK's revenue growth from these top 100 customers has averaged 12% annually the past five years.72% of revenues are derived from annual subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically pre-paid. 60% of revenues are from the US P&C insurance industry.Acquisitions - VRSK has made 9 acquisitions over the past three years, all in their Decisions Analytics segment. the acquired companies provide fraud identification and detection, loss prediction and selection solutions to the healthcare market. VRSK's fraud identification and detection business is their fastest growing niche.This is a large, very successful insurance risk management operation embedded in the US P&C insurance sector with large proprietary databases, datasets and algorithms. The real issue here is not whether VRSK is investable, it is 100% a matter of valuation on ipo. We'll take a look at this below. - There is a bit of net debt here post-ipo, $689 million. It appears much of the debt has been taken on as a result of the 9 acquisitions over the previous three years.VRSK has steadily grown annually over the past five years. This has been a result of organic growth coupled with acquisitions. Revenues have grown quarterly for at least 8 quarters in a row.Gross margins and operating expense ratios have remained steady the past 4 years. The result is VRSK filtering revenue growth to the bottom line at roughly the same dollar for dollar amount over the years. - Revenues were $893 million. Gross margins were 57%. Operating expense ratio 22%. Operating margins a strong 35%, indicative of an automated/embedded type operation. Debt-servicing ate up 10% of operating profits. Plugging in taxes, net margins were 19%. Earnings per share were $0.92. - Through the first half of the year, revenues appear on track for $1.04 billion, a strong 16% increase over 2008. Gross margins look to be 56%-57%, operating expense ratio 21%. Operating margins should once again be in the 35% ballpark. Debt servicing should eat up close to 9% of operating profits. After tax, net margins should be 19.5%. Earnings per share should be approximately $1.10. On a pricing of $20, VRSK would trade 18 times 2009 revenues. - Blue chip ipo coming at a very attractive valuation. There are years of revenue growth, strong operating margins and extremely high barriers to entry. This is a large 98 million share deal (assuming over-allotments) with all shares coming from insiders. Because of this, VRSK may trade a bit heavy early on any opening pop. Anywhere near the $19-$21 range, however, and this is a keeper. Strong recommend here in range for mid-term.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Verisk Analytics' IPO: The Only Risk Management Game in Town for Property, Casualty Insurance@2009-10-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/verisk-analytics-ipo-only-risk-management-game-town-property-casualty-insurance-2009-10-19
