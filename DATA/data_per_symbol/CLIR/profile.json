We believe that our patented ClearSign Core(TM) technology can\r\nenhance the performance of combustion systems in a broad range of markets,\r\nincluding the energy (upstream oil production and down-stream refining),\r\ninstitutional, commercial and industrial boiler, chemical, and petrochemical\r\nindustries. Our ClearSign Core technology, which is our primary technology, uses\r\na porous ceramic structure held at a distance from the injection planes of a\r\nburner to significantly reduce flame length and achieve very low emissions\r\nwithout the need for external flue gas recirculation, selective catalytic\r\nreduction, or excess air systems. To date, our operations have been funded\r\nprimarily through sales of our equity securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f03%2f30%2f0001104659-20-039929.html#FIS_BUSINESS\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Brian G.
