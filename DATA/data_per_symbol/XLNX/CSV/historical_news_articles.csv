A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday introduced a bill that would provide more than $22.8 billion in aid for semiconductor manufacturers, aiming to spur the construction of chip factories in America amid a simmering strategic technology rivalry with China.Chip factories can cost up to $15 billion to build, with much of the expense in the form of pricey tools. The proposal would create a refundable income tax credit for semiconductor equipment, $10 billion in federal funds to match state incentives to build factories, and $12 billion in research and development funding.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)((; (415) 344-4934;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@U.S. lawmakers propose $22.8 bln in aid to semiconductor industry@2020-06-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-lawmakers-propose-%2422.8-bln-in-aid-to-semiconductor-industry-2020-06-10
"mid much gloom about dividend cuts and freezes during the coronavirus pandemic, about a dozen S&P 500 companies managed to swim against the tide by announcing increases in April.That comes as about 20 firms in that index said last month that they plan to slash or stop paying their dividends to preserve cash as they try to stay afloat during the crisis.Among those S&P 500 members on the positive side of the dividend ledger in April were health-care conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (ticker: JNJ) and consumer-staples company Procter & Gamble (PG). Both declared 6% quarterly dividend boosts. Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble are members of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, all of which have raised their dividends for at least 25 straight years.Meanwhile, retailer Costco Wholesale (COST) is planning to pay a quarterly dividend of 70 cents a share, up nearly 8%, or 5 cents.Many banks are opting to maintain their dividends at current levels as they eschew stock buybacks. First Republic Bank (FRC), however, last month declared a quarterly disbursement of 20 cents a share, versus 19 cents, for a 5% boost.Another bank in the S&P 500, People’s United Financial (PBCT), plans to boost its dividend as well. It declared a quarterly disbursement of 18 cents a share, up slightly from 17.75 cents. “The ability to provide a consistent cash return of capital to shareholders is a key part of our business model,” CFO David Rosato told analysts during the bank’s first-quarter  on April 23.Insurance company Travelers (TRV) declared a quarterly dividend of 85 cents a share, up from 82 cents, for an increase of nearly 4%.Energy companies, and their dividends, have been hit hard during the pandemic and the sharp drop in oil prices due to over supply. But Kinder Morgan (KMI), which operates oil and gas pipelines and terminals, bucked that trend by declaring a 5% increase of its quarterly dividend to 26.25 cents. That equates to an annualized payout of $1.05 a share, although it was below the $1.25 the company had originally projected.In an April 22 press release, the company’s executive chairman, Richard D. Kinder, said in part that “in unprecedented times such as these, the wise choice is to preserve flexibility and balance sheet capacity.”Technology companies, by and large, have been able to weather the crisis thanks to strong balance sheets and more durable businesses.
                International Business Machines (IBM) late last month declared a small dividend increase to $1.63 a share from $1.62. That’s less than 1%, but it’s still an increase.Apple (AAPL) said after the close Thursday after that it will raise its quarterly dividend by a little more than 6% to 82 cents a share from 77 cents.Elsewhere in the tech world, chip maker Xilinx (XLNX) said it will raise its quarterly dividend by a penny to 38 cents a share. The company’s CEO, Victor Peng, said on the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter  on April 22 that it plans to be more conservative with stock buybacks “as we focus on capital preservation and further improving our strong liquidity position.” One sector that’s considered relatively solid for dividend safety, even in this current environment, is regulated utilities given the durability of their businesses. Southern Co. (SO) plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 8 cents a share to annually to $2.56.The biggest declared dividend increase among S&P 500 firms last month came from Newmont (NEM), a global mining company. It plans to raise its quarterly payout to 25 cents a share from 11 cents.The declaration of future quarterly dividends, the company said, hinges in part on the “duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
                Nasdaq (NDAQ), whose various businesses include equity derivative trading and clearing, plans to raise its quarterly dividend to 49 cents a share from 47 cents. That’s a 4% boost.

"In trading on Friday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) crossed above their 200 day moving average of $91.67, changing hands as high as $92.28 per share.  Xilinx, Inc. shares are currently trading up about 3.1% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of XLNX shares, versus its 200 day moving average:

   

Looking at the chart above, XLNX's low point in its 52 week range is $67.68 per share, with $133 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $91.95. The  information above was sourced from

"
There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $80.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $105.00.  The standard deviation is $8.013.


But the whole reason to look at the average XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $92.73/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $92.73 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

"Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 5/12/20, Invitation Homes Inc (Symbol: INVH), Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX), and Tetra Tech Inc (Symbol: TTEK) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends.  Invitation Homes Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.15 on 5/29/20, Xilinx, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.38 on 6/3/20, and Tetra Tech Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.17 on 5/29/20.  

As a percentage of INVH's recent stock price of $24.85, this dividend works out to approximately 0.60%, so look for shares of Invitation Homes Inc to trade 0.60% lower — all else being equal — when INVH shares open for trading on 5/12/20.  Similarly, investors should look for XLNX to open 0.45% lower in price and for TTEK to open 0.24% lower, all else being equal.



When an S&P 1500 component reaches 20 years of dividend increases, it becomes a contender to join the elite ""Dividend Aristocrats"" index.  Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is a "","" with 16+ years of increases.

Invitation Homes Inc (Symbol: INVH):
   Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX):Tetra Tech Inc (Symbol: TTEK):
In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.41% for Invitation Homes Inc, 1.78% for Xilinx, Inc., and 0.95% for Tetra Tech Inc.  



		

In Friday trading, Invitation Homes Inc shares are currently up about 1%, Xilinx, Inc. shares are up about 1%, and Tetra Tech Inc shares are up about 1.6% on the day.

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the First Trust Lunt U.S. Factor Rotation ETF (Symbol: FCTR), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $21.99 per unit.


With FCTR trading at a recent price near $19.85 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.77% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of FCTR's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM), Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX), and Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL). Although JPM has traded at a recent price of $92.14/share, the average analyst target is 12.69% higher at $103.83/share. Similarly, XLNX has 11.40% upside from the recent share price of $83.24 if the average analyst target price of $92.73/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MRVL to reach a target price of $28.62/share, which is 11.38% above the recent price of $25.70. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of JPM, XLNX, and MRVL:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"'s  fiscal fourth-quarter results turned out to be a mixed bag. The chipmaker beat Wall Street's revenue expectations by a small margin and met earnings estimates, but its guidance played spoilsport.Xilinx forecast $660 million to $720 million in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the mid-point of which is going to fall well short of the consensus estimate of $738.8 million. The company had reported nearly $850 million in revenue during the prior-year period, which means that its top line could crash over 18% annually in the June quarter.The uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic has also forced Xilinx to refrain from providing full-year guidance. That's because the company expects some of its core markets to witness ""evident"" disruptions on account of COVID-19. However, a closer look at Xilinx's business indicates that it may be able to weather the near-term headwinds and get back on track once things return to normal. Let's see why.Image Source: Getty ImagesXilinx ended the fiscal year with $2.27 billion in cash and $1.25 billion in long-term debt. It generated operating cash flow of $345 million during the quarter as compared to $288 million in the year-ago quarter despite a 9% decline in revenue. The company has also generated $1 billion in free cash flow over the past year. data by This robust cash position allowed Xilinx to ramp up  during the March quarter as its stock price took a hit. The company repurchased $470 million worth of stock during the quarter as compared to $261 million worth of repurchases during the December quarter. The reduced share count should have a positive impact on the company's bottom line and help mitigate the COVID-19-related weakness to some extent.However, Xilinx management has now decided to be more prudent about how it spends the company's cash. It plans to be ""more conservative"" with buybacks, as focus shifts toward the preservation of capital and maintaining a strong liquidity position. Despite that, the company has decided to raise its quarterly dividend by 3%. Its forward  now sits at 1.75%.The company had paid $372 million in dividends last year, and it should be able to afford the small increase thanks to its strong cash position. Meanwhile, Xilinx is also trying to keep a check on its expenses.The company managed to keep its fourth-quarter  operating expenses of $317 million slightly below original expectations by reducing hiring and discretionary expenses. Xilinx anticipates non-GAAP operating expenses between $307 million and $311 million this quarter as compared to $306 million a year ago.Xilinx management made it clear in the latest  that the company won't be resorting to layoffs to reduce costs. It plans to pursue other avenues to keep a handle on its expenses. In all, Xilinx's strong balance sheet should allow it to continue creating shareholder value and also weather the coronavirus-related downturn that its business is facing right now.Xilinx may have delivered terrible quarterly guidance and pulled its full-year forecast. But there were a few positive takeaways from the quarter that could help this tech stock make a comeback in the future.The company's data center business got a nice shot in the arm during the quarter as revenue jumped 77% year over year. Xilinx credits this impressive jump to an increase in demand from cloud computing and high-performance computer customers. More importantly, Xilinx added that its data center pipeline opportunity is growing in the double digits in these uncertain times.Xilinx's data center business now accounts for 10% of its overall business. It could play a bigger role for the company in the coming quarters as demand for components could increase if operators need to increase their capabilities in a bid to tackle the surge in data traffic. An uptick in this business should help the company mitigate the weaknesses in other areas to some extent.Meanwhile, Xilinx's  business recently got a shot in the arm thanks to a tie-up with . The South Korean corporation will use Xilinx's Versal adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP) in commercial 5G deployments across the globe. Samsung anticipates that chips using Xilinx technology will be available to customers from the fourth quarter of 2020.These developments indicate that there may be light at the end of the tunnel for Xilinx once businesses resume normal activity. The company says that it has entered the latest quarter with a ""backlog ahead of our historical average.""The stock may test investors' patience as the coronavirus might dent .Xilinx's automotive business, for instance, has taken a hit as auto sales in China and other geographies have slumped thanks to COVID-19. Revenue from this business increased just 2% annually last quarter, but it is expected to be ""meaningfully down"" this time. Along with broadcast and consumer, the automotive business supplies 16% of the company's total revenue.The industrial business -- which accounts for half of Xilinx's revenue along with the aerospace and defense businesses -- is also expected to be disrupted by the coronavirus. The company has warned that COVID-19 has started impacting demand, so investors can expect things to get worse before they get better.In all, it is likely that Xilinx stock could lose more ground in the coming months as the true impact of the coronavirus on its business is revealed. But its strong balance sheet, a nice dividend, and a pipeline could help Xilinx get back on track once things are normal.This is why it may be a good idea for investors to keep a close watch on this  and consider building a long position if it gets cheaper in the coming months.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them!

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin the conference. -- Thank you, Christina. And good afternoon everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO; Brice Hill, our new CFO; and Sumeet Gagneja, our Chief Accounting Officer. Since Brice only recently joined Xilinx and wasn't here during the last quarter, for this call, Victor will provide the financial and business review of the March quarter and the business outlook for the June quarter.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information as currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.In addition to GAAP financial measures, we will be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period to period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions. We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business.

This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thanks, Matt. And thanks to everyone for joining today's call. I'm excited to have Brice Hill, our new CFO joining us today. Brice, welcome to your first Xilinx . -- Thank you, Victor. It's nice to meet all of you on the line virtually and I'm thrilled to join Xilinx. I'm impressed with the products, the strategy, the vision of the company and especially the leadership team and just excited to contribute to the future. So thanks, Victor. -- Thanks, Brice. So let me start by spending a few minutes on actions we're taking to address COVID-19 challenges and our assessment of potential impact to our business before moving on to Q4 FY 20 results and our outlook for Q1.Because of the uncertain business environment due to coronavirus, we will not be providing full year guidance for FY 21. I hope that each one of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our hearts go out to those who have been personally impacted by COVID-19. I also want to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers around the globe who are on the frontlines of fighting this once in a century pandemic.As we're all adapting to new ways of living and working, the physical and mental well being of our employees remains our highest priority. We have implemented work-from-home globally, except in China where the employees have been allowed to return to work. We've also enforced social distancing practices, have adopted strict travel restrictions as part of many other measures we've taken for the health and safety of our employees. We've worked hard to improve our employees work-from-home experiences and their productivity. In addition to the connectivity enhancements, we've increased internal communications to keep our employees both informed and engaged. To alleviate anxiety and enable better focus, I've communicated some items that there will be no workforce reductions during the rest of this calendar year. We'll control expenses as appropriate by means other than job elimination.As a company, we're doing our part to fight COVID-19. For our healthcare industry customers, we've formed a task force to provide special assistance, prioritize product fulfillment and expedite shipments. I am proud that our technology which powers millions of medical devices like ventilators, patient monitors, respirators, patient ICU beds play a role in combating the coronavirus.In late January, we supported China's largest medical equipment maker Mindray with thousands of Spartan-7 FPGAs to power patient monitoring systems. We're currently working to support some of the largest medical suppliers in the U.S., such as GE Healthcare as well as companies in Europe and Asia to supply products for testing and treating COVID-19. In addition, Xilinx donated a total of $1.1 million to several organizations including the WHO, as well as regional and local non-profit institutions.Turning now to our update on our supply chain and demand impact from COVID-19. Our supply chain remains intact without significant disruption. However, we started seeing COVID-19 demand related impact midway through the quarter with weakness in our Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer business. The weakness was more pronounced in the automotive business as car sales in China and around the globe declined significantly. We also saw weakness in broadcast in the China channel businesses. Nonetheless, our team has executed extremely well and the overall business impact in the quarter was relatively modest keeping us within our guidance range.Now I'll talk about our fiscal year 2020. Fiscal 2020 was much more challenging than we anticipated. Our business is materially impacted by the U.S. export restrictions to Huawei early in the fiscal year and the overall challenging global trade environment, coupled with general weakness in the semiconductor market in calendar 2019. Despite these challenges, we had another record year with $3.2 billion of revenues growing 3% year-on-year. This is a testament to the resilience of our business which attribute it to the diversity of the markets we serve and the strength of our product leadership. In FY 20, we also generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and returned significant value back to shareholders with $372 million in dividends paid and spending over $1.2 billion to buyback 12.9 million shares.Now moving on to the fourth quarter highlights. The Advanced Products category constituted approximately 70% of total revenues. Zynq-based revenues grew 2% year-over-year despite the impact of weakness in Wired and Wireless, and the Automotive businesses and represented 20% of our total revenues. Zynq revenue and design win momentum continues to be strong across our target markets.In the communications market, we recently announced a strategic engagement with Samsung for their second-generation 5G radio design that includes beamforming based on our 7-nanometer Versal ACAP. This engagement is driven by the compelling Versal value proposition, particularly our AI engine architecture as well as our commitment to deliver optimized and differentiated platform solutions for our customers.Telefonica, a multinational telecoms carrier announced its plan to build next generation wireless radio networks using O-RAN collaborating with Xilinx and other leading companies. Our RFSoC products will be used in their 4G and 5G radios.In the Data Center, we announced Xilinx's first comprehensive SmartNIC platform, the Alveo U25. It combines a highly optimized SmartNIC platform of the powerful and flexible FPGA based engine. In addition, we're working with [Indecipherable] and Samsung's SmartSSD storage group to deliver intelligent storage using FPGA based computational accelerators.Across our core markets, we announced a range of new advanced machine learning capabilities in our products for the professional, audio, video and broadcast markets.On the software front, we have had over 20,000 Vitis downloads since we announced Vitis this past November. We have trained over 10,000 developers to date, an increase of over 250% since last year. We have around 1,000 software partners working with us and a growing library of application. Lastly, we doubled the number of production applications running on our platform since the previous year.Moving to a review of our business groups and core markets for the fourth quarter. Our core markets performed largely as expected. We saw strong sequential revenue growth as programs ramped at multiple emulation and prototyping customers. A&D and ISM were both up as expected with A&D revenues growing double-digits. We had expected auto revenue to recover but auto revenues are flat due to COVID-19 impacts. As expected, AVB and consumer were weaker, but the weakness was more pronounced due to COVID-19.The Data Center Group performed as expected with strong sequential growth primarily due to contributions from compute acceleration, driven by a mix of both cloud and high performance compute customers. We saw notable strengths from a hyperscaler deployment of a FPGA-based SmartNIC and our DCG opportunity pipeline continues to grow at double digits, particularly in video, HPC, database and fintech applications.The Wired and Wireless Group performed better than expected. We had expected Wired revenues to decline but the market grew due to some strength in optical transport networks and access. Wireless revenues performed better than expected due to stronger radio shipments. Lastly, as expected the ASIC transition, which we talked about at length in the past, is largely complete.Now moving on to the financials for the fiscal fourth quarter. Q4 revenues was in line with our guidance range, despite the mid-quarter impact from COVID-19. Total revenues were $756 million, up 5% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year. Data Center Group revenue increased 77% year-over-year and was up 14% sequentially. Wired and Wireless Group revenue declined 46% year-over-year and was down 19% sequentially. AIT revenue increased 15% year-over-year and was up 30% sequentially. ABC revenue increased 2% year-over-year, but was down 13% sequentially.Gross margin was higher than expected primarily due to product mix with GAAP gross margin of 70% and non-GAAP gross margin of 71%. GAAP operating expenses at $350 million and non-GAAP operating expenses at $317 million were both below mid point of guidance due to reduced hiring and discretionary spending. GAAP operating expenses included a pre-tax charge of $28 million related to severance pay expenses as we completed the restructuring that we announced in late January. GAAP operating income was $178 million or 24% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $218 million or 29% operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate was approximately 15% and non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 16%. The higher tax rates were primarily related to larger contribution of revenues and profitability from higher tax jurisdictions.GAAP net income was $162 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.65 a 32% year-over-year decrease and a 2% sequential increase. Non-GAAP net income was $193 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.78, a 17% decline from last year and a 15% increase sequentially. Diluted share count decreased to 249.3 million. Gross cash was $2.27 billion with $1.25 billion of long-term debt. Accounts receivables increased to $273 million is at 33 days compared to 32 days last quarter. Overall, we generated $345 million in operating cash. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares at an average price of $83 per share and paid dividends of $91 million.Turning now to the outlook for fiscal first quarter 2021. We expect first quarter revenue to be between $660 million and $720 million, which at the midpoint is down approximately 19% year-over-year and down approximately 9% sequentially. Our guidance incorporates the current assessment of the impact from COVID-19 with the somewhat broader range also reflecting the fluidity of the environment. In addition, customer-related program timing and dynamics, which I'll go into shortly, are also contributing to the steeper than normal sequential revenue decline. That said, we're entering the quarter with backlog ahead of our historical average which gives us a degree of confidence in our revenue expectations. The sequential decline in first quarter revenue is expected to be driven by lower AIT, ADC and DCG sales, partially offset by growth in WWG.Now within AIT, TME sales are expected to be down, but coming off of a record quarter in fiscal Q4 as E&P customers programs continue better at more modest pace. A&D sales are also expected to decline primarily due to a very meaningful purchase of a specific customer program in fiscal Q4, that's not repeating in Q1. ISM is expected to be flat due to strength in the medical marketing -- the medical market despite headwinds related to COVID-19 and the other markets. All ABC end markets are being impacted by weak demand resulting from COVID-19. Automotive is expected to be meaningfully down, while Broadcast and Consumer are expected to be slightly down.DCG sales are expected to decline from last quarter. As I've said in the past, our DCG business continues to have greater quarterly revenue fluctuations compared to other businesses as we are in the process of driving our DCG business of scale, but we are laser focused on sustaining double-digit growth on an annual basis over the long term. WWG is expected to grow modestly with improvement in Wireless and to some extent -- a lesser extent, excuse me, in Wired business.Fiscal Q1 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 68% and 70%. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be between $307 million to $311 million, which reflects our new adjusted spending profile. Non-GAAP other expense is expected to be approximately $13 million due primarily to expected lower interest income and foreign exchange hedging losses. Finally, our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 9% to 11%.Turning to FY20 and overall, while we're not providing full year guidance, we believe the impact of COVID-19 related disruptions will be more evident in some portions of our core markets, including Automotive, Broadcast, Consumer, Industrial and [Indecipherable] Test. We expect the rest of our core markets to be relatively less impacted by COVID-19, but we are continuing to monitor the situation very closely. Despite a modestly slower 5G deployment ramp, we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in WWG, We also expect DCG to continue to build its pipeline as customer engagements go into deployment at hyperscalers.Regarding our shareholder return programs, we plan to be more conservative with our buyback activity as we focus on capital preservation and further improving our strong liquidity position. Our Board has approved a quarterly dividend increase of approximately 3% to $0.38 per share and we remain committed to growing our dividend over the long term. We are focused on being good stewards of Xilinx's capital and continue to drive free cash flow generation.So in conclusion, I'm extremely grateful and proud of our employees for the dedication they've exhibited and keeping our commitments to our customers and running the business while coping with COVID-19 pandemic. Despite today's challenges, our belief in, and commitment to our growth opportunities in the Data Center, 5G infrastructure and Automotive markets remain undiminished. As the leader in adaptable platforms, we're driving SAM expansion, share gains across our diverse and resilient core markets with innovative products like Zynq, RFSoC and Versal. We remain 100% focused on executing on our strategy to empower more customers with powerful adaptable platforms and deliver long term shareholder value. Operator, I'll now open the call for questions. -- Christina, we'll turn it to you for questions.Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Hi guys, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Victor, I wanted to ask a question on COVID-19 and the demand impact that you're seeing in your business. You gave great color in your prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit in terms of what you saw in the quarter from a revenue standpoint. If you can provide some numbers around the impact, that would be helpful. And then similarly for the current quarter, appreciate the level of uncertainty, but if you can kind of speak to what exactly you're seeing across your customer base, as it relates to COVID-19, that will be helpful. Are there cancellations, push-outs, downsizing of projects? If you can kind of speak to those, that would be great. And then I've got a quick follow-up. Thank you. -- Okay. Sure, Toshi. So on fourth quarter, we did see some impact, but I'd say, all things considered, relatively modest, because it just started happening midway through the quarter and I shared the end markets like Automotive, I think somewhat pretty -- as you would intuitively expect. In terms of the current quarter, obviously, we're seeing more meaningful impact. I would say that, as I said in the prepared remarks, it's not only COVID-19, but if I had to point to one single thing on why the both the midpoint and then the range we're providing is broader is due to COVID-19, and I think kind of went through some of the end markets that are more exposed to that. We are of course not only increasing communications with our employees but very much so with all our key customers with Avnet, our partner, with our supply chain, with our customers' customers and a lot of the end markets. So we're doing everything we can on this uncertain environment to collect a lot of information.And so what I would tell you is that, you know, we are not seeing cancellations. We do not see things like double bookings because of work concerns around material. A few areas where there is people are creating buffer stock, but not very expensive and again overall, we have historically higher backlog than we ordinarily have. So I would say that we do have some confidence in that because of that and because of the high level of communication that we have engaged. That said, look, we're definitely in uncharted territory. Right? So we have factored in some degree of, say, turns degradation over time and just the general uncertainty. So I think we are really trying to do the balance there. I hope that helps. -- Yeah, that's great. And then as a quick follow-up, on the Samsung 5G win with Versal, I was hoping you can help us again sort of quantify the potential impact to your business over the next couple of years. I'm sure it's going to take some time, but both in terms of timing, as well as magnitude, how meaningful this specific win could be for your business? So if you can kind of touch on that, that'll be helpful. Thanks so much. -- Yeah. So Samsung is -- that's a very meaningful win for us and opportunity and again this is for their second generation of 5G and I think we don't break out specifics of customer revenue but it is a very meaningful engagement for us. And I think the bigger picture here is, again, we're still in the early stages of 5G, what's shipping today is first generation and what -- as you can see, we're engaged in development of the second generation and pretty much all our customers talk about there being at least three generations. So we're still in the early stages and we absolutely are confident that this is still going to be a very large long term opportunity for us. I think the other thing, as we've said in the past too, is it tends to be, even in normal circumstances, somewhat lumpy and now with the COVID situation, it adds more uncertainly. So I think the timing is more challenged, but pre-COVID, we still would have probably said that this is sort of later in the calendar year and then being more robust in the next calendar year. But now, of course, we'll have to see with the COVID situation. -- Thank you. -- You're welcome.Your next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Great, thank you. Following up on that last question, the WWG segment, the revenues are down. I think Wireless infrastructure probably down to below 4G levels at this point. So, it seemed like a pretty compelling growth opportunity. At the Analyst Day, last year, you talked about what you see the total area under the curve growing by pretty impressive numbers, obviously you expected the ASIC transition, but you didn't expect Huawei to become more challenged. But how are you seeing that opportunity out in the next two, three years? Do you still see significantly larger business than 4G even missing Huawei from that forecast? -- Yeah, Joe, great question. I think two to three years out, we should, well, knock on wood, certainly, some of the challenges that we see in visibility with the pandemic, and out in that tight kind of timeframe, we do believe it will still be meaningfully larger than 4G despite not having the Huawei business. And, again, I know again considering that there was a -- this thing has been dropped off, but the fact that we were still able to have this being north of $1 billion after losing one of our top customers, I think, gives you an idea of that even in the early innings of 5G, this is strong for us. So yes, I think when we get through some of these kind of near term headwinds and uncertainty, it's definitely still going to be a very significant opportunity for us.And again, this is both because 5G is going to be a much bigger kind of deployment and we're offering a heck of a lot more value between our RFSoC lines, our Versal lines and just the way we're working with the key suppliers. I think we're really working very closely with them to get their optimized architectures out. So we still feel very solid about that. And I guess the only other thing I would say is that one thing about the COVID issue is that, in some markets, you could argue that there could be demand disruption and in this situation, I think it's really delay as opposed to the demand disruption and, of course, timing of guessing what -- how the delay recovers or how that plays out is difficult. -- Great. And then just to clarify, I mean you're still selling some trailing edge product to Huawei, I believe. Can you quantify that and is it -- is there much Huawei to think about in your forecast? -- Yeah, no, Joe, it's really pretty de minimis. I mean, we don't really count on it and because it is pretty much more modest and it's just not something we count on. But yes, from time to time, we have some amount of Huawei revenue. -- Okay, thank you.Your next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open, please go ahead. C.J., your line is open. -- Maybe on mute.Moving on to Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Hi, guys. Can you hear me? -- We can, Ross. -- Perfect. Glad my mute button doesn't work. Just had a question on the -- Victor, you said no double ordering, no buffer to speak of. I noticed your turns really popped up to kind of the higher-end or the highest end of what you guys do in the last couple of years. I guess, how do you judge whether you are seeing those pull-ins and why would the turns have popped up so much if it wasn't pull-in behavior? -- Well, you know, I think since we cover so many different markets, it kind of depends a little bit on what areas. But, I'd say, look, China is coming back after shut down and obviously, they're pretty committed to driving their 5G deployments. But that's one aspect where there is, you can imagine, some catch-up. I think some of the other areas people are -- or maybe concerned, although our lead times and our ability to deliver and ship for people have not been affected. But, it could be because of that, but we are talking to everyone very closely. And again there are some instances where people are doing that, but it's still pretty modest and we absolutely have not had any cancellations and -- so far. But we understand that things could change, which again is why we're putting in a bit of a broad range that we also factored in that into our midpoint. -- Got it. And then one longer-term question. You mentioned about the wide array of engagements that you have in software development, etc, that can benefit your Data Center Group. I just wondered if you've seen the activity on your customer side change at all during the COVID side, on one hand, those are the customers that can keep their longer-term development going because they're so well financed and see growth, etc. But people are fearing that even that market, if the recession gets nasty, would clamp down on some of the new launches that were otherwise planned and your company would benefit a lot from those new launches. So any sort of update on the activity you're seeing from an engagement level from a longer-term perspective as well as kind of the near term? -- Yeah, that's a good question and it's something I talk to my team and the sales group pretty specifically about. And, you know, people are really remarkable. I think, you know, our current businesses -- our current customers, excuse me, and the customers that we've engaged in some meaningful kind of proof-of-concepts and things getting to trial to production, we're not seeing any fall-off there. I mean, everybody is pretty committed to try and keep their businesses running. Where we could see, if this is very prolonged over a period of time, is capturing whole new customers, as you know, we're gaining share as well as SAM expansion and we've already done a good deal of that. But I would say, right now, we see no impact to opportunity pipelines or anything. I'm just saying, not sure if this prolongs for a very long time, people are mainly focused on their current suppliers of course and driving what they're doing there. But we don't see anything material right now. -- Got it. Thank you.Your next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Data Center business. It sounds like you're a bit more confident in the visibility that you're seeing on proof-of-concepts moving into kind of production deployment. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there and how much traction have you been seeing from the SmartNIC category, obviously, the Solarflare Alveo U25 products? And then I have a follow-up. -- Yeah, I think that, again, it gets back to the kind of quality and intensity of engagements and the results that we're seeing people are getting. I mean they -- people -- when your'e a new platform, they're only going to move to a new platform if they really do see significant improvements and we're very encouraged about what we're seeing and also the fact that, again, there's very strong interest in the expansion of of our Alveo line even though the revenue is still out in front of us as far as that goes. I think, you know, I guess I'll also say it, even in the pandemic, we have customers that are using our accelerators to accelerate their genomic analysis and simulations and things like that and so that's again shining a bright light on the power of what some of our acceleration technology can do for some of these applications. So that is all encouraging. That said, again, you know, the exact timing of how that ramps up tends to be a bit bursty and there is definitely going to be a little uncertainty here with the impending or the looming recession that we seem to be going into. -- Fair enough. And then on the Versal product, obviously coming off the heels of the Samsung announcement, can you just remind us again of where we stand, or how we should think about materializing revenue contributions and are you still on track with some of the product lineup expansion that you've previously outlined? Thank you. -- Yes, again, when we did the reduction in force and -- that we announced in late January, and some of the other expense reduction measures, we were very thoughtful and making sure that we were not going to do any harm to anything strategic and our long term objective to drive sustained double-digit growth in the long term. And I think we've managed to do that and we're going to continue to take that posture even through this downturn. We do have other levers that we can pull, should this worsen, but, you know, what we're going to do is make sure that we're positioned to take advantage of when that the recovery does occur in a very fulsome way. We are also very committed during this very trying time to be a very good supplier to all our key customers and so we are going to manage things, basically, responsibly, but we don't want to do things that jeopardize a longer-term program. And that's not only tape-outs, by the way, that is, as you heard me talk about the factors improvement we made in the ecosystem, we made in the software development in Vitis and just being ready for download for few months and the traction we're getting there. So we're definitely going to keep on the gas pedal, so to speak, in driving the ecosystem as well as the key programs. -- And, just specifically in 7-nanometer, would you expect that to contribute to revenue toward the end of this year, late in the year? -- Yeah, I mean we will position for production of the first part, but then through next year and the next several years. As you know, it's a very broad product family and we'll be doing lots of tape-outs that will address many different market segments at different price and performance and power points. So we're still in the early days of that, but as far as 7-nanometer, it will become -- it will start -- it will really start to ramp next fiscal year, I would say. But, yes, we are poised to go into production late this year. -- Thank you.Your next question is from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Yes, thank you very much. Victor, I just had a question on where we are heading into and I was a little confused, why would backlog be up and what is your perspective on what we are heading into versus '08 or '09? Yesterday we had this representative from TI tell us that he is ripping open the -- not ripping, he is opening up the 2008, 2009 playbook to kind of think through revenue. So having lived through many cycles, what is your perspective on what we're heading into versus the last one? And then I had a little bit longer term product question. -- Okay. Well, I guess the first point about the backlog, I mean, again it is very different depending upon markets. I mean, Automotive, very -- they meaningfully said that their forecast is way down from what they originally gave us. I mean, more than one very significant customer that the supplies the major OEMs. We also obviously, as I said, see pretty strong amount of weakness in AVB. There's no sporting events, the Olympics is delayed by a year. So some of those things are pretty clear and so obviously we're not seeing backlog there. But on the other hand, Aerospace and Defense, it's really unaffected. I think there are certain areas that, in the long term, would actually increase the potential upside. You know it's a little hard to know when or how. But just clearly there is a lot more activity both, work-from-home, as well as, entertainment from homes, so video streaming which was hot before the pandemic, that's clearly going to go and increase. And one of the applications that's really good at accelerating is actually video transcoding and other kinds of video processing. And that doesn't have anything to do with AI and we could also do AI coupled together with some of those video processing applications.I think also communications infrastructure, again, the capex is -- we'll have to see how that plays out, but it's just going to be a lot more traffic. So I think some of those elements are probably why that occurred. And again, as you can imagine, we're very sensitive to make sure that isn't just inventory builds or things of that nature. So I think on the other part of the question about 2008, 2009, we definitely are looking at multiple scenarios. Right? And that does include looking at that and so I won't tell you that doesn't inform how we think about looking in the future and trying to be prepared from downsides as well as upsides but we're a very different company from 2008, 2009. I mean, I think we have well over 40% more revenue. We -- Zynq didn't even exist, just to bring that to perspective, that product didn't even exist, let alone RFSoC, let alone Versal ACAP and we weren't pursuing the Data Center market, right? AI didn't exist back then, as far as any kind of big opportunities. So we feel that, while we consider that we think about that, for us anyway, our decision is that's not the right blueprint. In fact, this is uncharted territory. It's unclear there's really any existent blueprint, at least from the way we look at it.So the last part of your question, are you... -- Yeah, no, I had a products related question. That's actually pretty helpful perspective, Victor, thank you. On the Samsung design win, I'm just going back to the X-DFT [Phonetic]. I mean, I forgot, the gentlemen from Samsung had come and presented and the relationship between you guys and them. So this is for the next gen. Can you just help us kind of understand because you guys have been on the back foot, I'm using an old cricket analogy from my cricket days, in terms of losing out design wins and ASIC replacing you and other ASSP solutions. So this sounds like something pretty meaningful and just help us frame the opportunity versus what you had in the first gen and against competing solutions, not necessarily against any competitor. That would be helpful. Thank you. -- Okay. And you know -- and I recognize that there is just an awful lot of narratives going on for multiple different players here. So -- but I will say, I think, I've been pretty consistent in saying that when we had an initial much larger part, we were, I think, just open and candid that we ended up being shipped in production and the base down which is not something we had expected to hold on to persistently. We've always said that we -- and it's true, historically we've been strong in radio, but we feel like we have further strengthened our radio capabilities with the RFSoC family and then I've always said that once Versal comes out, it'll even strengthen further compared to ASSPs and ASIC opportunities because the significant increase in compute density, right, the level of integration and the fact that it is such a powerful true platform, right, it's not a fixed solution. I've always felt that, that was going to significantly improve our competitive positioning. And you know the Versal Samsung engagement, I think, is bearing that out. And, again, remember we're not in production with Versal yet. We will be prepared to go into production at the end of this calendar year and then you're going to start seeing the train of all the other products coming out.So we definitely feel that we're going to have a very significant position. And I've said in the past too that it is a very competitive market. But competing at ASICs is nothing new, right. I mean we've been doing that back in the 4G generation. Essentially the same customers we picked up and then now we are unable to work with Huawei. But I mean I think it's obviously a core market we've known about for decades. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Okay.Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good afternoon. Could you talk a little bit about any meaningful changes in inventory levels at the distributors and any potential supply chain disruptions that impacted your Q2 guidance? -- Yeah, so in terms of our channel inventory, it's not that much. There are some fluctuations, but it's really pretty minor and we're not concerned about it at all. We do talk very closely with Avnet, of course, so we don't see any issues there. By the way, I know you asked about channel specifically, but our own inventory did reduce slightly. In terms of -- you said Q2, I think you meant Q1 guidance, but for us fiscal Q1 guidance, I think, again, we don't have supply chain disruption. We are with TSMC still and so we don't have any meaningful supply chain in China itself, which obviously had the biggest impact. And we have excellent relations with our strategic suppliers, so we don't see that. And we, in fact, have reached out to all our customers to really reassure them in terms of our lead times and our ability to deliver for them. So it's not -- we don't see supply chain related impacts. -- Okay. And then as a follow-up, trying to see the progress that you're making with the Vitis software platform and how much compatibility you're providing so far and I know that it's obviously a work in progress. Any metrics that you could provide us with such as maybe how many TensorFlow functions Vitis is supporting currently or anything that will gauge -- that will allow us to gauge the type of traction you have and what you're targeting for the next year? -- Yeah, I mean I don't know if I can give you TensorFlow functions, but others in my group can, of course. But I think that, again, we've had 20,000 downloads and we only announced this thing in November. So I think the interest is very strong. We do have -- we've also done training, we know we have engagement with customers, but it is pretty early days. But it's also not a static picture, right? We continue to add more optimized libraries, which by the way, are other libraries we provide and we also provide some reference neural networks for different kind of applications of markets, we open source all of that. So we are seeing very encouraging activity and really good momentum. But of course it will take some time for that flow through to actual revenue, of course. But we're very encouraged and very excited about the traction we have so far. -- Great, thank you.And your next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, hi. Sorry about earlier. And thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping to head over to back to WWG and I guess outside of Samsung Versal and what you're doing in 5G overall, can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of your legacy networking business both wireline and wireless and how we should think about trends for that business? -- We are still shipping 4G and we do still think that there'll be some ongoing business there even, even as 5G starts more fulsomely ramping. So we do see, on the wireless side, business there. On the Wired, as we said, we actually thought that was going to be weaker and it was a little bit stronger. And I do think clearly there, two things, again, I think there is a lot of traffic going on, right, because of both commercial activity with work-from-home, but also just all kinds of streaming and ultimately as there's more wireless bandwidth infrastructure build out then obviously the core networks have to be upgraded as well. So I think we do see opportunity there. Again, it won't be, from a percentage growth, quite as robust as we expect Wireless will be over time once we get through maybe some of the near term uncertainty and some of the engagements that we have in development go to full production. But we see that there will be strength in both, but again, Wireless will definitely still be stronger than the Wired side. -- Got you. Very helpful. And understandably with COVID, not giving full year guide makes perfect sense but curious on what you can control. Can you offer any thoughts on how should we think about opex through the year? -- Yeah. Since we had done some reductions before we -- in $0.01 [Phonetic], ended up being for $0.02 [Phonetic], it is that we're already in somewhat of a leaner mode. I think that there are some additional levers that we could pull as this plays out, if it turns out to be longer, deeper, whatever. At the same time, the way C.J., I'd like you to think about is what we're going to try and do is make sure that we're positioned to manage through if it gets more severe as well as if it does improve. We absolutely -- we are a bigger, stronger company than the financial crisis. We're more strategic to a number of our customers and we're building new relationship with the new key customers like in the hyperscalers, right. We weren't even going after those back then. Right? So we absolutely want to make sure that we're there for them when they -- either even just to make sure we could deliver what products they need even in the downturn or things are starting to inflect, we want to be there for them. So again I don't want you to think that we're going to go wild here, but we're definitely going to try and make sure that we'll help our customers and ourselves as well to come out even stronger from this downturn. -- Great. Thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, good afternoon, Victor. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Just kind of curious, just given that the DCG story is very much sort of a customer penetration rate of adoption story. How does that work in an environment where many people are sheltered in place and we're working from home? Is it -- can you give us some sort of a qualitative assessment of how you think your team is doing along the lines of customer engagement to try to drive growth in that business longer term? -- Yeah, I think the customers in those markets, of course, of all, are probably the ones that are more proficient at being able to switch to working from home, the kind of collaboration that we have and so forth. And again, since those are really deep engagements at the technical level. They're not just commercial kind of engagements. That's absolutely proceeding. Our engine teams are having the same kinds of, in some place, weekly meetings and calls and people are able to whiteboard with the technology that we have for collaboration these days. So I think that's really not been an issue. And again as I said, in some cases, that this is driving people to even more vigorously want to look for putting acceleration in place. I kind of referred to people doing genomics kind of acceleration and those kind of applications, we're definitely seeing that. We're also seeing -- we talked about streaming of course, again I think streaming was big before, now it's even more so, because even more people who are doing entertainment and just everybody is creating their own tik-tok videos or whatever it is. So I do think that that's continuing without any kind of interruption and again, you could argue that maybe when things really settle down, it should drive that opportunity to be even greater. -- That's helpful, Victor. And then, Victor, I apologize for this question but it's one that I get asked often by investors. I'm just kind of curious, there has been a lot of rhetoric and talk in some of the popular press that this administration might actually potentially ban all FPGAs going into China. It feels to me like a slippery slope argument because I'm not sure the difference between that and a general-purpose computing devices. But can you help us sort of handicap that risk and how should we think about mitigation factors on your end? -- Well, I think as many of you probably know, I'm also on the Board of the SIA and both the SIA and we individually are engaged in constructive dialog with the government to help them both understand the complexity of the global supply chain and the key care about for semiconductors and they're certainly trying to drive some meaningful trade issues. However, we've been very clear, both as part of SIA and Xilinx on our own that blanket kinds of things like that. These sort of bludgeon hammers are going to do damage to the industry as a whole and the U.S. is the world leader in semiconductors and the last thing you want to do is really do material damage to the industry as a whole. And so we do not -- and we've been clear about that. We don't think that's the effective approach to resolve some of these issues.So whether that's FPGA technology or it's just blanket, everything needs a license going to China kind of thing. Those are examples of one instrument kind of things, right? I think the only other thing more specifically as I -- I mean Huawei revenue were precluded from shipping from them and clearly they're finding some way to still build some 5G infrastructure. I won't get into a debate about what that looks like and the details, but I think it'd be hard put to sort of say over a long period of time how any specific technology can be withheld forever and other than doing some unintended consequent damage. So I don't know how to put probabilities on this, to be honest, C.J. I hope you understand. But we were clear about positions and again I think we've had good -- some good constructive conversation. So, sorry about that. -- Thank you. That's OK. Appreciate the answer.Your next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks for taking my question. Victor, I know you answered a question on this already, but I'm going to ask if you could linger on this comment you made earlier about the ASIC transition. I think you said it's largely complete. Maybe you can just remind us historically where have you played in the base station in places that you both get designed out of and where you can retain a position and confirm that I heard you correctly, that that transition, as it relates to 5G is complete already and what content do you have in 5G that you didn't have in 4G. It's a sort of a long question, it's my only one. Thank you. -- Sure. Look, I mean, we've had -- traditionally we've had a position in radio and that's been our strength where we've had more persistence. I don't want to make it sound like we've had no content in baseband, but typically what we've had in the baseband is a much smaller percentage in terms of the content. In other words, a smaller companion FPGA, if you will, together with some sort of whether it's an ASIC or some other ASSP. So it's not that we haven't had any baseband, but in the beginning, as everybody recalls, 5G deployment started sooner than what people thought in South Korea and we were being shipped both in the baseband as well as in the radio, and not just in South Korea, we saw a bit of that in other markets. And that was the part that we kind of said, look, we don't expect to have that persist the level of content there. And so when I say it's largely over, that's what I was referring to.Now, look, I don't want to sort of say that, OK, there will be no replacement whatsoever. Look, it's a competitive market. We always have to deliver value to our customers and that's what we aim to do, which is why we're not just doing pure FPGAs. We significantly increase the value that we deliver to our customers and we'll continue to do that, not only in the products, but also just how closely we engage. We're doing a lot of close, I'd say, almost collaborative engineering work together to help them deliver to their goals. So I think it's a combination of all of those. So -- but it's complete as far as everything that we see on the horizon. And of course, we'll continue to compete vigorously and I think the Samsung win is one example. And you'll hear more over time. -- Thanks, Victor.Your next question comes from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Just one quick one and a product related follow-up. The first question is just within your ABC segment since Automotive is obviously going to be challenged. If you could give us a little bit of a just rough picture of how big the Automotive business is within that segment and just kind of the magnitude of maybe the drawdown into the June quarter that you're seeing, given the sharp declines in auto production etc, that'd be helpful. And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks. -- So, OK, so, Auto -- OK. Auto, we don't give exact details but auto is on the order of somewhat over $200-ish million, $250 million on an annual basis just as far as ABC. That's the order of magnitude in terms of that part of the ABC basket of markets. And one thing I would say is that I think everybody knows that that's going to be quite challenging. It'd probably take a bit longer to work through. But again, similar to the question on 5G, for instance, if you kind of go out to certainly three years and beyond, there is still a very big opportunity here, right? Because the OEMs are still going to be rolling out new models. We have a very strong position in advanced driver assist systems for safety systems and those safety standards keeps going up with each model here, right? So they have to deliver even more safety capability and what used to be kind of like options are now spreading into standard equipment not only in premium and mid range, but even into the value parts of people's lineups.So there is -- well, things will be challenging and it'd probably take a while for end unit sales to go up, content is still going up for automobile and because there is a timeline on when they have to meet safety standards and so forth and we have strong positions in things like front camera, surround view, the new thing is monitoring systems, driver as well as passenger monitoring systems and automated valet parking. We do feel good when you get more out to that two to three-year timeframe, then we'll have a very strong opportunity there and then certainly even going further out, fully autonomous driving, we are definitely being designed into those as well. I think we've already said that even before this situation that, of the three big growth drivers of Data Center, 5G and Auto, Auto was something that tends to take longer time anyways, right. This probably just pushes out a bit more. -- Got it. Thanks for the granularity and the context there, Victor. As a follow-up, I just wanted to ask in the Data Center business there is obviously the networking and the storage in addition to the compute pieces, but on the compute side, specifically, could you talk a little bit about your software and ACAP engagements? I'm just wondering ACAP Versal is a very different type of product that mixes general purpose and accelerators and PLD logic and just how the reception has been within the compute sliver of that business, specifically and how those engagements have been going? Thank you. -- Yeah, maybe first I'll just sort of say, in the compute segment, in general, I think we've always said that we see in the long term, that would be the biggest opportunity. But that also is the area that requires the most heavy lift and build out in terms of our ecosystem, right, the applications, having fulsome set of ISVs and covering different applications. So -- but in the meantime, of course, we're making good progress there, but in the meantime things like SmartNIC and then the smart storage areas, you don't need those sorts of things. And so it's a much more direct engagement with the highly technical teams of the customers. So that's why you hear us talk about -- like recently you've seen some good SmartNIC activities and others.But coming back to the compute side, few things, one is, we did announce Vitis and as you see that it's early days, but we're seeing really good traction there. Versal is still also -- it's just pretty new and I'd say that, for instance, our Alveo boards and some of the work that's being done, there's still a lot of work that's being done on our UltraScale+ architectures, especially now that we've released these new boards like the U50, which has got HBM memory and have high half length kind of form factor. So really, really dense compute density in that form factor. And then the U25 now for SmartNIC, first time that we have that out. So I think that we are seeing good traction there in terms of applications within the compute side. I think we've mentioned video several times. I think database analytics is another one. We're starting to see some good interesting traction in high-performance computing. And then there's fintech and now genomics is something that we've done and typically medical takes a long time too, but that's happening a little bit more accelerated now. So there are a lot of different applications. And I think Versal will take a bit longer just because we're just in the very first product going to production. But once that's there, we think the barriers are very high, because that's a very powerful architecture and again there is a very high degree of, I'd say, software element to it, which again makes it stickier. -- Thanks very much. -- And, operator, I think we have time for a couple of more questions.Certainly, your next question comes from Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks for the question. I'll try to do two quick ones. I guess the first, just in relation to the last question, I think this is the first time you called out SmartSSDs. Maybe if you could just talk about computational storage, how large do you think that is as a percentage of DCG and what kind of growth rate are you expecting versus your double-digit segment growth rate overall? -- Yeah, I think, we've got some good engagements there. Again, we don't break into fine granularity, each of those. I wouldn't say that it's, today, a very large portion of the revenue, but I think that we do think, over time, it's a pretty substantial serviceable market for us. If you kind of go out maybe about three years, we think this could be $800 million kind of level of opportunity. So we're still again in the relatively early stages, but it's sizable. I want to say that I don't think the breakdown of our revenue today is necessarily reflective of the opportunity of that. I think everybody knows that there's really disruption across the entire Data Center and where you do the computes and a lot of -- there's a lot of movement toward trying to do the compute closer to where the data storage is, so you don't use bandwidth and burn a lot of power in the Data Center moving data around. So I think it's a good opportunity, but today, I would say, it's relatively modest. -- Great. And then, I've been following you guys for a while, and in the old days, it used to be all Altera versus Xilinx and who is getting to the next node first and I understand that, Victor, under your leadership, you've really taken a different approach where you've emphasized architecture over node changes. But I guess my question is why didn't you push 7 as well simultaneously? Why does it seem like it's one or the other? And then should we believe that your decisions that you made at 7-nanometer should also inform us to the speed of 7 in which you will pay? -- So let me just make sure I understand when you say, why didn't we just push 7? I think what you mean, why didn't we just push trying to get out in 7, really, really quickly? Is that what you're referring to? -- Exactly. 7 has been out for a while, so why didn't you move more quickly? In the old days, it used to almost be a race to the next node. -- Yeah. And again, I think the reason why in the old days it was a race to the next node was because both, us and the former Altera were just basically producing pure FPGAs. And it being a pure FPGA, the main way you deliver value to your customer is by increasing your capacity of gates, right? Because that's how they implement more functions. So if we get the next node first and you have a higher density of usable gates then you're delivering more value to the customer quicker. Once we started doing things like adding a multi-core SoC, like with Zynq, we started adding other things. We could deliver value not by just increasing our programmable gate count, right? Now, it's a little bit of an oversimplification, right. I mean like, obviously we have some of the best sturdiest quality in the industry and certain other things, but that was really why back then when you're doing just pure programmable devices, it was really mainly a race to the next gate.I will also point out that, now everybody is very hot on chip widths and other forms of advance integration. And as you know, we've been doing SSIT or what TSMC calls their CoWoS technology since the 28-nanometer generation. So I'll also point out that, because we were already able to do more than mode load, if all you did want was massively large FPGAs, well, we are already there back in 28-nanometers. And we've had our SSIT portion of our product portfolio ever since. Right? So I think it's a combination of architectural innovation, other forms of integration beyond just monolithic and in the case of RFSoC, integrating very advanced analog together with digital technology, that's yet another form of integration that we've been a leader on. So, I guess, maybe the way to really think about it is, we've continued to integrate more value each generation. But we're not doing it solely for getting to the next node. Does that make sense? -- It does. I'm just wondering why you couldn't do both at once and whether anything might change as we move to 5-nanometers. -- Well, that's the higher order bit. I guess if you go down to the next level of detail on is that -- keep in mind that UltraScale+ is an extremely successful product. So there is also just the pure -- because we have MPSoC, right, and then we have RFSoC and we've continued to also increase on the high end in just terms of really large capacity FPGAs with the VU19P, that was just recently released by far and away the leader and just maximum capacity. So part of this is also the great success of our [Indecipherable]products. It doesn't -- didn't require us just racing to the next node and then part of it is the Versal ACAP is such a powerful but complex architecture that takes quite a while to sort of develop and it's going to take a while for our customers to fully adopt. But once they adopt it, it will be a very strong level of incumbency, I believe. -- Thanks. -- Yeah. -- And operator, I think we have time for one more question.Thank you. Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, hi, guys. Just wondering, when you look at your fiscal '21, you mentioned ASIC transition mostly complete. Just wondering how you see the growth in the WWG, now that you don't have that ASIC headwind. And I have one follow-on. -- Well, again, we're not providing full-year guidance because of all the uncertainty in the environment, but I guess I want to go back to my comment that we overall still feel 5G is going to be a very big opportunity for us and even despite not being able to sort of Huawei anymore. So we still feel very good about the growth over time in the long run. RFSoC has continued to get great traction. Most of that volume deployment is in front of us, although we have had volume deployments in different geographies with different OEMs and then Versal is in front of us. Right? That's all in front of us and we're just talking about the very first design win we're getting with Versal. So we feel very good about the opportunities we see in WWG, but I wouldn't try to predict right now FY21. -- Got it. And, I don't know if you already answered this, but you mentioned two wins at Samsung, I believe one on the radar beamforming side for 5G and one on Versal for, actually, computing with Samsung. Just wondering if you sized both the opportunities as you look at the ramps there. Thanks. -- I think we mostly talked about the Versal Samsung 5G engagement. The other referenced Samsung with their SmartSSD and that 16-nanometer UltraScale+ based engagement. But clearly, you know, with all our key customers, we're talking together about our complete roadmap, but we have nothing specific to say about Versal with respect to Samsung storage at the moment. But, yeah, we've got really good engagements in 16-nanometers with multiple customers that served in the Data Center as well as good traction in Versal. -- Great, thanks. -- Welcome. -- So, Christina, I think we'll wrap it up there. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific, 8:00 PM Eastern Time.

Our next earnings release date for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 will be Thursday, July 30 after the market close.

"Stocks go up and stocks go down. But when it comes to the broad and volatile semiconductor sector, variability can even see both happen at the same time. Working to validate that track record are three popular semi stocks indicating investors should be ready to diversify long and short within this important group.It generally remains a smart approach to follow or invest alongside the broader averages. Over longer time frames and during more meaningful market cycles, most listed companies go along, up or down, with the  or other broad-based indices. That’s common knowledge. It’s also why trading with the trend is popular, particularly in rising stock markets like today.In our estimation the current market environment is inviting investors to trade the market long. But as I’ve recently stressed here at InvestorPlace,  is making increasing sense.Given this observation, as well as semi stocks’ reputation for mixing it up in bull and bear markets, the following analysis takes a dive into two names to buy and one company whose shares are set up for shorting.It’s also true that within the market, semi stocks have a history of often testing bullish investors wherewithal. Even when the overall investing environment appears healthy, smaller business cycles, competition and near constant product innovation mean today’s hot semiconductor company can quickly become tomorrow’s bear, and vice versa.
Source: Semi stock Advanced Micro Devices is our first company to trade. And this semiconductor is a buy. The past few years have taken a company on life support with small chance for recovery and transformed it into the S&P 500’s best performing stock. Shares have rocketed from around $2 in 2015 to a current market price near $55 that’s just removed from all-time-highs.Bulls that rode shares higher can largely thank the smart leadership and execution of CEO Lisa Su. Over this period Advanced Micro Devices has successfully taken market share away from the likes of  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) with a myriad of competitive products across sub-markets in the industry. AMD isn’t done either. Right now the price chart is indicating there’s more to come.Technically, shares of AMD are forming a corrective three month long cup-shaped base within the stock’s larger uptrend. It’s bullish and looks more compelling as the price pattern has developed around the semi stock’s prior all-time-high from 2000. Along with stochastics ready to reinforce Advanced Micro Devices’ price tenacity upon signaling a bullish crossover and , this semi stock is ready for upside action and new highs. I’m long, but smartly hedged and invite other investors to consider doing the same.
Source: The next name on our list of semi stocks to trade are shares of Micron Technology. Investors can consider MU stock the epitome of price volatility. The outfit’s memory markets have a history of erratic behavior on fast shifting supply and demand variables.That characteristic has been tamed somewhat in our ever-connected world. Still, MU remains one the more visible movers-and-shakers within the semiconductor industry. And in today’s stock market, some nearby shaking to the downside is increasingly evident on the price chart.Technically, Micron stock has gone from a promising corrective cup-shaped basing pattern that began nearly two years ago to confirming a double top formation.The monthly view of this MU stock seen above illustrates our concern. With the cup failure also occurring on a bearish trade-thru of MU’s key 50% retracement level and stochastics pointing lower just out of overbought territory, the downside looks like unfinished business.
Source: The final stock on our list of semi stocks to trade is programmable chip manufacturer Xilinx. This less-talked about large-cap just released  and reduced guidance going forward.That sounds less-than-inspirational. But companies have been known to sandbag. And given the novel coronavirus, my guess is Xilinx could be attempting to set investors up for future bullish surprises rather than more disappointment. The price chart agrees.Technically, shares of XLNX have established a meaningful corrective low on the monthly chart. April’s rally has confirmed a bullish hammer candlestick which found long-term price support in-between the stock’s 50% – 62% retracement levels tied to the 2008 financial crisis. The situation appears bullish, but there’s more to Xilinx as well.The monthly price action has also tested Xilinx’s lower Bollinger Band. That’s good news. What’s more, the volatile bottoming candle has successfully straddled a four-year long uptrend line after failing a shorter uptrend as shares corrected. Now, with earnings out of the way and stochastics successfully bottoming to support a low in shares, there’s even more reasons to see this as a semi stock to buy.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler’s management own positions in Advanced Micro Devices () and Micron () shares and derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.

5G is here. The new digital wireless technology first started to make waves in 2017, with connectivity tests in Argentina, Norway, and Poland. By late 2018, active 5G networks were starting to appear on a limited basis in various urban areas, and in 2019 the first nationwide networks went into operation in the US and China. As 2020 matures, industry analysts expect to see these networks expand, as providers move into the mid- and high-frequency bands.The new network rollout brings with it a slew of opportunities, as does any new technology. Original equipment manufacturers will need new components. The new networks will require a denser network of towers and transmitters, which in turn will require their own hardware. Semiconductor chip makers especially are looking forward to increased sales as the new equipment brings with it needs for updated and upgraded chips.To this end, we pulled up  to learn more about two exciting plays in the 5G space. According to the Street, both of the Buy-rated stocks could win big as this new technology trend takes over. Let’s jump right in.Operating on an IP licensing model, Resonant designs filters for radio frequency and front-ends for mobile devices. With the company expected to be a major beneficiary of the 5G rollout as the adoption of XBAR architectures in the mobile handset space ramps up, now could be the right time to pull the trigger.This is the stance taken by Needham’s . The five-star analyst recently hosted a Zoom investor call with CEO George Holmes, and the analyst walked away more confident that the Chinese smartphone market is rebounding. Back in February, China handset shipments declined by 50% year-over-year, but consumer demand is on the rise once again. While not a full recovery as shipments in March 2020 are still down 20% year-over-year, the rate of decline is slowing, demonstrating that the situation is improving. This is significant as the company relies on China for a significant portion of its revenue.Expounding on the importance of the market recovery in China, Gill stated, “Through its partnership with Murata, the largest filter manufacturer in the world, RESN's XBAR technology is largely targeted towards Chinese handset OEMs and the Chinese handset market.” He added, “Moreover, RESN indicated that Tier-1 handset OEMs in China have not made any changes to their 5G handset roadmaps and still are on track to roll-out several 5G models.”Also encouraging, despite a slight deceleration in Europe, statements from base-station equipment vendors imply that globally, 5G infrastructure deployment is on track. This leaves the door open for RESN, according to Gill. “We view XBAR technology as critical for 5G mobile applications and well-positioned to handle the key 5G requirements of higher bandwidths, rejection of unwanted signals/ noise, and increases in antennas,” he commented.Based on all of the above, Gill’s bullish thesis remains very much intact. He kept both his Buy recommendation and $3 price target as is. This conveys his confidence in RESN’s ability to surge 20% in the next twelve months. (To watch Gill’s track record, )What does the rest of the Street think about RESN’s long-term growth prospects? It turns out that other analysts agree with Gill. The stock received 4 Buys in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. At $2.74, the average price target brings the upside potential to 9%. ()As for the second stock on our list, Xilinx is the leading supplier of programmable logic devices (PLDs), a rapidly expanding segment of the semiconductor industry. Given the current economic landscape, one analyst thinks that its standing sets it apart from other players in the space and positions it for success.Writing for Baird, five-star analyst  argued, “Xilinx is very well positioned given the current macro environment given its lack of exposure to supply chain disruptions, fabless model not impacted by utilization rate fluctuations, and high infrastructure exposure with notably 5G infrastructure and video streaming which we see as beneficiaries of work-at-home trends.”While acknowledging that there has been some concern surrounding the level in which XLNX is participating in 5G infrastructure buildouts, Gerra cites its large-scale Samsung win for second-generation 5G as demonstrating the company’s focus on this part of the business. “We continue to believe FPGA opportunities in radioheads will remain long-lasting, while management continues to see 5G as a meaningfully larger opportunity than 4G,” he noted.Specifically looking at 5G as a growth driver for the company, XLNX is expected to participate in almost 40% of China Mobile's recent $5.3 billion tender. On top of this, next year, the company will grow its Versal lineup into a much broader product family. Gerra believes this underscores its market share gains.Even though the company’s fiscal Q1 2021 guidance calls for revenue and GAAP gross margin that comes in below Gerra’s forecasts, the analyst sees XLNX emerging as a long-term winner.As a result, Gerra stayed with the bulls, reiterating an Outperform rating and $105 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of 16% could be in store. (To watch Gerra’s track record, )Looking at the consensus breakdown, other analysts’ opinions are more varied. 8 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Additionally, the $94.88 average price target implies modest upside potential of 4%.

The U.S. stock market has been on a roller coaster ride of late, thanks to the novel coronavirus pandemic that has put businesses in a major spot of bother. The economic fallout of the COVID-19 disease is expected to be severe, with  predicting that the U.S. economy could contract as much as 34% in the second quarter of 2020.Grim economic forecasts such as the one from Goldman have kept the stock market under pressure, though there has been a partial recovery over the past few weeks. However, stocks continue to remain cheap despite the recent rally, giving savvy investors an  into fast-growing sectors such as  at a discount.  and   are two stocks that expect to benefit from 5G deployments. Both companies are sitting on a nice pile of cash that should not only help them weather the ongoing crisis but also allow them to initiate  to lower their share counts and boost earnings per share.More importantly, Skyworks and Xilinx are trading at attractive levels after the recent sell-off, giving management all the more reason for repurchasing shares and delivering long-term value. Let's find out a bit more about these two 5G stocks. data by Skyworks Solutions was in the news last month after slashing its fiscal second-quarter revenue guidance. The   component supplier blamed supply chain disruptions and a weak demand environment caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. That wasn't surprising as Skyworks relies on Apple for 51% of its revenue. What's more, 20% of the company's sales come from China -- the original epicenter of the novel coronavirus pandemic.Apple is reportedly , while smartphone sales in China have plunged substantially over the past couple of months. These developments will negatively affect Skyworks' business in the near term, which is why investors have pressed the panic button and sent shares down nearly 25% this year.But the crash has made Skyworks stock cheaper. It is trading at less than 19 times last year's earnings and 4.74 times sales. For comparison, the chipmaker's 2019  averaged nearly 25, while the  was at 6.25.This presents a great opportunity for Skyworks management to repurchase shares, as it has $1.19 billion in cash on the balance sheet and only $160 million in debt. The company had announced a $2 billion share repurchase program in February last year, and it should have ample authorization left. Skyworks repurchased $658 million worth of shares in fiscal 2019 and $74 million in the first quarter of 2020.So, Skyworks may accelerate its repurchases in the wake of the recent stock market correction and reduce the outstanding share count. This will have a positive effect on the company's earnings per share and also pave the way for stronger growth when the 5G smartphone catalyst actually arrives.CCS Insights predicts that smartphone sales could start recovering next year -- growing 12% in 2021 and 13% in 2022 -- after an expected decline of 13% this year.As Skyworks' balance sheet indicates that it is well-positioned to weather the near-term weakness, investors should consider going long given its attractive valuation, a potential bump in buybacks, and an uptick in smartphone sales next year.Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx got off to  in 2020 as the company's 5G business lost momentum on account of a pause in network roll-outs. However, the recent stock market recovery has been kind to Xilinx stock, as the company's communications business -- accounting for 31% of the total revenue -- is expected to hit a bottom as per Goldman Sachs.The investment bank predicts that Xilinx's communications business could hit  on the back of data center demand. That may well be the case as the rise in telecommuting, online learning, and gaming related to lockdowns and social distancing measures has led to a spike in data center activity. This could boost demand for Xilinx's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that are being  to accelerate workloads. Similarly, Xilinx may also benefit from an uptick in 5G deployments in China, as it counts .But given that Xilinx also relies on the industrial, aerospace, and automotive businesses for a nice chunk of its revenue, things are likely to get worse for the company before they get better. So there's a probability of Xilinx stock getting cheaper in the near future, and that might open up an opportunity for the company to accelerate buybacks.Xilinx currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.4, lower than the five-year average multiple of nearly 28. The company's balance sheet appears to be in good shape, with a cash position of $2.4 billion and total debt of $1.3 billion. Xilinx's cash pile should help see it through the current downturn and also give management the opportunity to buy back shares at a cheaper valuation.The company's board had approved a $1 billion share repurchase plan in October last year. Xilinx had repurchased $261 million worth of stock by the end of 2019, according to its last earnings report, so it has enough authorization left to buy back more stock.Don't be surprised to see Xilinx management boost share repurchase activity in light of the recent pullback in the company's stock price.

The last year has been rough going for . The field programmable gate array (FPGA) leader first started to show signs its growth run was coming to an end during the U.S.-China trade war,  after the White House restricted sales to China's tech infrastructure giant. The coronavirus pandemic is now proving to be a second jab, with key outlets like the auto and communications industries (including 5G network development) dropping off sharply due to the ensuing global economic freeze.The result was record revenue in fiscal 2020 (the year ending March 28, 2020), but a drop in profitability. The company has taken steps to protect its balance sheet and set itself up for an eventual return to growth, but the outlook for the immediate future leaves a lot to be desired.Image source: Xilinx.There was some good news during the fiscal 2020 fourth-quarter update. Supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 hasn't been an issue, and the economy in China is rebounding. CEO Victor Peng said that sales to medical equipment makers across the Pacific were strong to help combat the spread of the pandemic, and sales to medical companies in the U.S. and Europe are also on the rise.  Data-center construction spending was also strong at the conclusion of fiscal 2020, as high-performance computing in the cloud -- like machine learning and video delivered via a network -- continues to rise in importance. And there was good news on the worldwide rollout of  as well. Peng said his company won a design win with Samsung on its second-generation 5G radio. Other networking hardware deals to help speed the spread of 5G were announced too.  As to specific numbers, Q4 revenue was $756 million -- a 5% sequential increase over the 2019 holiday season, bucking the normal seasonal slowdown trend. Year over year, though, sales were down 9%, driven by a decline in communications and automotive industry end markets. Resulting adjusted earnings per share were down 17% from a year ago. For the full-year period, revenue still managed a new all-time high, but the bottom line deteriorated due to the multiple headwinds from the trade war and COVID-19.Revenue$3.16 billion$3.06 billion3%Gross profit margin66.9%68.8%(1.9 pp)Operating income$792 million$957 million(17%)Adjusted earnings per share$3.35$3.48(4%)Pp = percentage point. Data source: Xilinx.  Note that adjusted earnings fell far less than operating income did over the last year. That was thanks to Xilinx spending over $1.2 billion on share buybacks in fiscal 2020. But with year-over-year sales and profits now in decline, management said it would be more conservative for now in making those purchases, focusing instead on further strengthening the balance sheet. And on that front, Xilinx is in exceptional shape. Cash and equivalents ended at $2.27 billion and long-term debt at $747 million. The dividend was raised by 3% to $0.38 per share each quarter, good for a current annual dividend yield of 1.7%.  But that's now all in the past, and it's the year ahead that is most important. Regarding the outlook, lower auto sales and a slowdown in global 5G rollout is going to take a toll. Full-year guidance wasn't provided, but fiscal 2021 first-quarter revenue is expected to be between $660 million and $720 million -- down 19% year over year at the midpoint. Some of the expected decline includes coronavirus demand disruption and data center sales that are proving to be unpredictably variable quarter to quarter. But the good news is that order backlog is higher than Xilinx's historical average.  It will be rough going this year, and even though Xilinx stock is down nearly 40% from its all-time high last spring, it still trades for 20.2 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. Nevertheless, the long-term thesis for this  remains intact, with 5G still in the early innings of development and data centers only growing in importance over time.

"Investors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 29th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new May 29th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $81.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.30.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $81.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $77.20 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $84.51/share today.

Because the $81.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.28% return on the cash commitment, or 38.52% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $81.50 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $84.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.67% if the stock gets called away at the May 29th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.09% boost of extra return to the investor, or 37.14% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 57%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 49%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $84.51) to be 48%.

It's been a long road downhill for . The pioneer of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) -- a widely used circuit that can be reprogrammed post-manufacture -- got hit in 2019 as the  heated up. With the coming economic fallout from the coronavirus lockdown, the company's growth prospects for the immediate future look grim. Share value has been nearly cut in half from all-time highs reached early last year.  However, Xilinx is well-positioned to ride out the storm. Profit margins remain high even though sales have tumbled, and the balance sheet is in good shape. The stock can't yet be called a value play, but it's worth keeping an eye on as the global economic situation evolves in the coming months.Image source: Xilinx.Field-programmable chips have been around since the 1980s when Xilinx introduced them, but the explosion in data-center construction and new telecom networks, and the tidal wave of connected things in recent years have been a boon for this type of semiconductor. However, as is common with all things manufacturing, the FPGA market leader has had some new challengers in recent years. Chip giant   and added Omnitek last year to its programmable segment.  and its graphics-processing units also compete with FPGAs for many of the same end-uses. To combat the ever-present risk of getting commoditized, Xilinx has been investing in new applications for its chips, including data centers, , AI, and connected devices. It has also been transitioning from a simple seller of hardware to a platform company -- a unified strategy that not only supplies chips but also developer kits and software to help speed up product application.  Though revenue has tumbled thanks to a recent slowdown in its network- and data-center buildout, Xilinx has been able to maintain high profit margins and is getting strong returns on its investments.  Data by .When the good times are rolling, it's easy to forget about the balance sheet and become hyper-focused on the income statement. In this regard, I'm guilty and have spent little time giving the rundown on the former. It's time to remedy that.The good news is that Xilinx's balance sheet is solid. At the , the chipmaker had $2.43 billion in cash and equivalents (about two years worth of operating expenses) and only $1.25 billion in debt. With further uncertainty clouding Xilinx's immediate business prospects, the company at least has ample liquidity to fall back on. Paired with its strong profit margins, the FPGA maker should be just fine.  But then there's the issue of valuation. Shares trade for 19.8 times trailing 12-month free cash flow (money left after cash-operating and capital expenses). So it isn't exactly a hot deal after the precipitous fall in the market. However, valuation is driven by future potential, and the digital world is getting a big bump from the coronavirus lockdown.  and connectivity were already fast-growing industries before the pandemic, so Xilinx should enjoy growth once more when the short-term situation normalizes.  Thus, Xilinx remains in my portfolio, and while I'm not currently buying, I will be closely watching when the chipmaker next reports earnings -- likely at the end of April or beginning of May.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"  stock was already in a spot of bother before the novel coronavirus pandemic wrecked the stock market, but one Wall Street firm actually has a positive view of the company's prospects. Xilinx stock was upgraded from neutral to buy by  recently on the back of a potential turnaround in the communications business and data center strength.That may seem surprising right now since Xilinx's  tailed off coming into 2020 as 5G (fifth generation) wireless deployments lost pace. The chipmaker saw a double-digit drop in its top line in the last reported quarter, while its net income was down by nearly a third over the prior-year period. Xilinx also pointed out on the last  that its wired and wireless business will decline for the full year.Despite these headwinds, Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari sees an attractive opportunity in Xilinx. Hari has increased his price target to $100, indicating a 25%-plus upside from current levels.Image source: Getty Images.Goldman believes that Xilinx's communications business is close to hitting a bottom. The problem is that Xilinx itself had admitted in January that it is witnessing a slowdown in the roll-out of 5G networks ""across multiple regions as many operators take a pause before the next wave of infrastructure deployment.""The loss of 5G momentum led to an 18% annual decline in Xilinx's wired and wireless business revenue in the fiscal third quarter. Xilinx gets 31% of its total revenue from this segment. A turnaround in this business could give Xilinx's top and bottom lines a nice boost in the coming quarters, and Goldman seems to be counting on the same.As it turns out, Xilinx believes that its 5G opportunity hasn't run out entirely and growth in its communications business could return in the long run. But for that to happen, 5G deployments will have to gain pace once again. One hope for Xilinx is China, where the government is aiming to deploy 300,000 5G base stations by the end of the year as compared to the current count of 75,000 base stations.Xilinx could take advantage of this roll-out thanks to its  Huawei, which recently won 57% of 's latest 5G tender. But at the same time, Xilinx investors shouldn't miss the fact that 5G deployments in other areas such as Europe will be delayed on account of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Huawei executive.So, it remains to be seen if Xilinx's communication business has actually bottomed, as a turnaround in this segment will be critical to the stock's performance.The investment bank is also counting on secular growth in the chipmaker's data center business. But this segment supplied just 9% of the total revenue last quarter, so it may not move the needle as much as the communications business would. Meanwhile, the broader slowdown in the semiconductor industry may negatively affect the chipmaker's prospects and weigh on a potential turnaround.The economic fallout of the novel coronavirus outbreak could weigh heavily on nearly 60% of Xilinx's business. The company gets 40% of its revenue from the industrial and aerospace and defense business, while another 19% comes from the automotive and consumer businesses.IDC estimates that there is an 80% chance of substantial contraction in global semiconductor sales this year on account of the pandemic. The firm forecasts that 2020 semiconductor revenue could fall 6% in its most likely scenario, as compared to an earlier expectation of 2% growth.Xilinx is likely to feel the heat of this contraction. For instance, demand for the company's automotive chips could take a hit, as  predicts a 23% decline in global auto sales as compared to last year. Meanwhile, the aviation industry is  because of the COVID-19 outbreak, so the demand for new chips could dry up as airlines scramble to reduce costs.Not surprisingly, analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance point toward further weakness in the company's top line in fiscal 2021. In all, betting on a turnaround at Xilinx and expecting it to become a  in these uncertain times does not seem like a great idea.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.  The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Can This 5G Stock Deliver 25% Upside in These Uncertain Times?@2020-04-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-this-5g-stock-deliver-25-upside-in-these-uncertain-times-2020-04-02

"Investors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options become available this week, for the May 1st expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new May 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.17.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $62.83 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $70.47/share today.

Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.34% return on the cash commitment, or 24.87% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $71.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.55.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $70.47/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $71.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.21% if the stock gets called away at the May 1st expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $71.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $71.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.46% boost of extra return to the investor, or 48.10% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 75%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $70.47) to be 42%.

Friday, March 13, was a great day for shares of ,  , and , with the three gaining 10.2%, 14.1%, and 15% to close out the week. Friday was a huge day for most stocks, with the and gaining more than 9.2%. Friday was on track to be a good day for most of the trading period, with the major indices up around 4% about one hour before the close. However, a news conference by President Trump and a number of key officials announcing a number of big steps to help address the health and economic impacts of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak stoked a  surge on Wall Street. By the close of trading, the indices, along with many stocks including the three named above, closed out one of the worst weeks in U.S. market history on a positive note. The following chart shows just how quickly the market turned sharply higher late on Friday:  data by Yet even with double-digit gains by all three, only Cognex shares finished the week above where they started, with Xilinx and NCR shares declining 4% and 19%, respectively. The market's treatment of NCR in particular highlights investors' worries over the , and how it is anticipated to significantly weaken the economy and potentially . NCR makes equipment that serves retail and merchant applications, manufacturers, distribution, and a litany of uses that will see reduced demand under a recession. Cognex is heavily exposed to China, and while , indications that COVID-19 diagnoses may be slowing should be seen as good news.  earlier this year as its results declined last year, so much of the worst worry about that company could already be priced in despite the market's overall uncertainty. Frankly, we just don't know what will happen next. The past week was one of the most volatile in decades, with Friday's huge gains coming only one day after stocks  by the most in a single day in more than 32 years. After a hugely positive reaction to the administration's announcements Friday, this weekend has seen expanded travel bans, with the UK and Ireland being added to the no-travel list beginning Monday. More than 2,700 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed as of late on March 14, a 1,000-case increase in just two days that has healthcare officials concerned the number of cases could skyrocket in the weeks ahead. And that could lead to a market reaction that erases Friday's big gains and takes stocks, including all three of these, even lower. No, that's not a hint that it's time to sell NCR, Xilinx, or Cognex. It's just a reminder that we are in uncertain times, and uncertainty will make for continued volatility. The best thing investors can do right now is a combination of sitting on their hands to avoid selling in the middle of a market crash, and . That's because things will eventually return to normal. Right now we just have no idea when that's going to be, and it's possible that means stocks -- including great companies like these three -- will fall even more before things start to turn for the better in a sustained way. But since none of us have any idea when the recovery will start, a combination of holding what you have and adding to it while the market is down will play to your favor.It may take a quarter or a few, or even a year or more, before things really bounce back. But they will, and it's the investors who took this market crash as an opportunity to , not sell, who will come out ahead in the long term. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"Investors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 15th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new May 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $65.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $75.58/share today.

Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.57% return on the cash commitment, or 48.95% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.55.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $75.58/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.87% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.02% boost of extra return to the investor, or 44.84% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 76%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 64%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $75.58) to be 47%.

Only time will tell if the wild advance in  (NASDAQ:) stock is over. AMD stock peaked in mid-February at $59.27. At the time, markets chose to ignore the ongoing concerns of  and its impact on the global economy. But in the last week, sentiment completely shifted. As they say, stocks take the stairs on the way up and the elevator on the way down.	The 2008-like selling in the last week made stocks look like they took the cliff down. And AMD stock was not spared. Should investors continue holding the company if even  (NASDAQ:) issued a  on revenue estimates?Chances are high that if PC operating system sales and Microsoft Surface tablet sales are on the decline, AMDÃ¢ÂÂs PC chip (CPU) and graphics card (GPU) sales will also fall. (NASDAQ:) also fell victim to the stock market selling in the last week, erasing gains made since November 2019. But AMDÃ¢ÂÂs rival,  (NASDAQ:), posted strong fourth-quarter results. It also forecasts strong first-quarter revenue of $3 billion. In Q4, NvidiaÃ¢ÂÂs gaming unit  growing 56% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Data center revenue grew 43% to $968 million.NvidiaÃ¢ÂÂs strong results in the gaming market suggests something different. Analysts thought Nvidia would earn $1.6 billion to $1.75 billion in revenue. But when the company posted revenue of $1.5 billion, it significantly missed expectations. This suggests that AMD Radeon GPUs are pressuring NvidiaÃ¢ÂÂs RTX ray tracing cards.In fact, if AMD sold more GPUs than Nvidia, then AMD had a 19% share of the GPU market. ÃÂ of the market and now has an 18% market share.Intel still commanded the GPU market with 63% of the market share, thanks to its integrated chip. Still, AMDÃ¢ÂÂs Ryzen 2400 and Ryzen 3400, which both have Vega-powered GPUs, are vastly better processors with better graphics performance than Intel. AMD just needs to chip away at IntelÃ¢ÂÂs market share.AMD posted a downside outlook in its . It said that Q1 revenue will be in the range of Ã¢ÂÂ$1.8 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 42 percent year-over-year and a decrease of approximately 15 percent sequentially.Ã¢ÂÂ The relatively new products of Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon will drive sales.Conversely, the refresh in gaming consoles will hurt semi-custom revenue. So, AMD stock may not take off until the launch of the next generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles.For the full year 2020, AMD forecast revenue growing 28% to 30%. Non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 45%. With this guidance, investors may assume revenue growing by at least 25% over the next five years.

Only  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) scores better.AMDÃ¢ÂÂs valuations were reasonable when markets were not fearful. But as last week demonstrated, Advanced Micro Devices is vulnerable to correcting further.The companyÃ¢ÂÂs valuation is the only thing holding the stock back from climbing higher.

"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.  One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.

In trading on Thursday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 29.4, after changing hands as low as $79.43 per share.  By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 24.4.  A bullish investor could look at XLNX's 29.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.    The chart below shows the one year performance of XLNX shares:
   
   

Looking at the chart above, XLNX's low point in its 52 week range is $79.43 per share, with $141.60 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $81.00.

"  was flying high on the  wave a year ago as the rollout of 5G networks in markets like South Korea and China gave Xilinx's top and bottom lines .But it didn't take long for Xilinx to turn from a top  into a laggard. The U.S.-China trade war  out of the chipmaker's sails, and now, a perceived slowdown in 5G investments is heaping more misery on the company. data by Xilinx's latest quarterly report . The company's revenue fell 10% year over year while net income fell 28%. In its press release, the chipmaker blamed ""global trade headwinds"" and ""a slowdown in both 5G and wired infrastructure deployments"" for its tepid performance. Xilinx will slash 7% of its workforce and also keep a check on discretionary expenses as it tries to minimize the impact of the headwinds it is currently facing. The bad news for Xilinx investors is that the bad times look like they are here to stay, at least for the short term, as telecom operators seem to be taking a breather before the next round of 5G infrastructure deployments.""The additional negative impact to our wireless business is result of a slowdown in 5G rollout across multiple regions as many operators take a pause before the next wave of infrastructure deployment,"" said CEO Victor Peng on the latest .Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx was already suffering from the ban imposed on doing business with Huawei, and now, the weakness in demand across its wired and wireless customers is weighing on the company's financial performance. Xilinx expects revenue in its wired and wireless group -- which supplied 31% of total revenue last quarter -- to decline in fiscal 2020. Revenue from this segment was down 18% year over year during the quarter. That's in stark comparison to the scenario just a year ago when Xilinx's fiscal third-quarter revenue from the wired and wireless business had shot up 41% annually.Now that Xilinx seems to have lost one of its major growth drivers, it is not surprising to see investors dumping the stock. Management is hopeful that the current downturn will only last until the next wave of 5G investments arrives. But will that really be the case?Peng believes that Xilinx's 5G catalyst will make a comeback. In his closing remarks on the latest , he said:It is important to remember we're still in the relatively early innings on 5G and it started out much stronger and earlier than people predicted. Now we're having a soft spot, but we're engaged. We have the right kind of engagements with top OEMs and there's still may more innings to come. So we remain bullish in terms of our overall long-term outlook in those growth drivers.Last year,  predicted that 5G infrastructure investments could nearly double in 2020 to $4.17 billion as more countries deploy the next-generation network. The year has just begun, so there is a possibility that 5G investments will gather pace as the year progresses. But Xilinx investors need to be cautious because the arrival of the next wave of 5G investments might not translate into financial gains for the company. That's because Xilinx  known as FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) that can be purchased off the shelf and allow telecom operators to quickly deploy networks for testing.And FPGAs have their limitations as far as performance and power consumption are concerned. Samsung has reported there's a move toward custom chips known as ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are more suited for the purpose. A move to ASICs would dent demand for Xilinx's FPGAs.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them!

"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the iShares Evolved U.S. Technology ETF (Symbol: IETC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $38.11 per unit.


With IETC trading at a recent price near $32.38 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of IETC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX), Micron Technology Inc. (Symbol: MU), and Booking Holdings Inc (Symbol: BKNG). Although XLNX has traded at a recent price of $81.06/share, the average analyst target is 20.37% higher at $97.57/share. Similarly, MU has 20.15% upside from the recent share price of $53.72 if the average analyst target price of $64.55/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BKNG to reach a target price of $1964.84/share, which is 19.27% above the recent price of $1647.44. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of XLNX, MU, and BKNG:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Shares of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) manufacturer  dropped 10.7% on Wednesday following the company's fiscal 2020 third-quarter report. They dropped slightly more on Thursday. Investors had expected it to be a tough period for the chipmaker, and revenue and earnings did decline, as management had laid out .  However, the company had a few unexpected surprises in store for shareholders and employees: a 7% reduction in its workforce through layoffs and a slowdown in hiring, and a cost reduction plan to make business more efficient. It isn't the end of the world, as Xilinx's FPGAs still have a future in the development of data centers, 5G mobile networks, and automotive technology, but cost-cutting at this level tends to throw shade on a stock's growth prospects. Don't panic just yet, though.  Image source: Getty Images.The trade war between the U.S. and China had started to take a toll on Xilinx, but up until the three months ended Dec. 28, 2019, the chipmaker was still notching year-over-year growth. In the most recent quarter, though, sales fell 10% from the year prior to $723 million, and adjusted earnings per share fell 26%.  There was some good news, though. Even with sales of FPGAs in reverse, gross profit margin on products sold improved to 66.8%, compared with 64.8% in the prior quarter. Still, operating expenses grew again, as they have been all year, which meant a steep drop for the bottom line -- thus all but eliminating a strong performance through the .  Metric9 Months Ended Dec. 28, 20199 Months Ended Dec. 29, 2018ChangeRevenue$2.41 billion$2.23 billion8%Gross profit margin65.9%69.2%(3.3 pp)Operating expenses$973 million$838 million16%Adjusted earnings per share$2.58$2.551%Pp = percentage point. Data source: Xilinx.  CEO Victor Peng said the expectation is that Q3 will be a trough and that business will rebound from here, but it will be a gradual rebound rather than a fast turnaround. Fourth-quarter 2020 revenue is expected to be $750 million to $780 million, up 6% sequentially but down 8% from a year ago at the midpoint of guidance. Gross margin should also improve again, forecast to be 67.5% to 69.5%, and operating expenses should be $351 million to $355 million -- which includes a $17 million to $20 million benefit from cost cuts but a $25 million to $30 million charge related to severance pay. Things don't look great at the moment for Xilinx, but it's important to remember that the chipmaking business is a cyclical one -- even for hardware that is benefiting from strong secular tailwinds. Before investors get too distressed over the quarterly update, there are a few factors to bear in mind.First, Xilinx's data center business is still healthy. Second-quarter sales from the segment were an all-time record, and while Q3 and Q4 are both going to come in lower,  is still pushing demand higher and is expected to do so for years to come. Automotive is another segment that should provide long-term growth as FPGAs find their way into the advanced driver assist packages available in most new cars. However, data centers and autos alone only accounted for 28% of sales in Q3.  That leaves the wireless and mobile segment as the primary source of pain. At about a third of overall revenue, the division's year-over-year tumbles made a big impact on Xilinx's results the past couple of quarters. Even with trade tension between the U.S. and China easing recently, Huawei remains out of the picture. Peng said, however, that even if the White House lifts its ban on doing business with the Chinese tech giant, he doesn't see revenue coming back to the pre-ban level. 5G mobile deployment has also taken a breather as telecoms gear up for the next big push, which has meant delays in purchases from Xilinx for the time being.  As a result, Peng and his team are declining to provide any specific guidance on fiscal 2021. Paired with the cost-cutting announcement, that cloudy view is what has the stock in retreat once again (the stock price is off nearly 40% from all-time highs reached in spring 2019). Xilinx will likely return to growth in fiscal 2021 -- as data centers and autos are expected to grow and the company starts to lap the Huawei sales ban -- so the aggressive cost-cutting is likely more a realignment of the business with reality rather than a reason to panic. Nevertheless, the Q4 report in another few months will be an especially important one to watch, indicating just how long the current slump will last and how strong of a rebound can be expected.

Equities gapped higher, flushed lower and then stabilized for modest gains in WednesdayÃ¢ÂÂs session Ã¢ÂÂ although earnings are all the buzz. With all of that in mind, letÃ¢ÂÂs look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.	 (NASDAQ:) stock is rallying, but the move doesnÃ¢ÂÂt come without concern. While it , and guidance blew past estimates, the stock struggled to hold its modest morning gains before lifting about 3% late in the session.While the rally did carry Apple to new highs, itÃ¢ÂÂs a relatively modest gain given the quarterly results the company turned in. ItÃ¢ÂÂs one thing to no longer be bullish, and another thing to be bearish. Right now, with Apple at all-time highs, the business doing well and the technicals aligned, I have little reason to be bearish. Although, IÃ¢ÂÂm not all that bullish after such a big rally.The stock technically unwound its overbought condition with MondayÃ¢ÂÂs rapid pullback. But with WednesdayÃ¢ÂÂs breakout over $320 resistance, Apple stock is on the move again. Over $320, and AAPL stock can continue higher.If it drops below $320, shares could lose more air. Below puts the 20-day moving average, and the recent $304.88 low on the table. Below that, and uptrend support and the 50-day moving average are in play.	As I  in the day, I love  (NASDAQ:) Ã¢ÂÂ but you canÃ¢ÂÂt miss on guidance and expect a rally. Even if a company beats on .That explains why AMD was down about 7% for most of WednesdayÃ¢ÂÂs session.Shares gapped below uptrend support (blue line) and the 20-day moving average, which have been support for months now. Now, though, it sits at a critical point on the chart. Currently trading near $47, this level has been short-term range support. Should it hold, look to see if AMD can reclaim the 20-day moving average in the coming sessions.Below $47, and AMD may need more time to cool off, potentially putting $45 and the 50-day moving average on the table. Below that, though, and the $42 to $43 zone is possible.	Like AMD,  (NASDAQ:) provided  guidance, with shares falling more than 10% at one point as a result.The action leading up to earnings was telling, as the stock broke below channel support (purple line) and lost its 20-day moving average. On the plus side, it did find support at the 50-day moving average, but that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter now following WednesdayÃ¢ÂÂs action.Furthermore, shares gapped lower, dropping below $90. This area of $89 to $90 was a notable layer of support in the fourth quarter. However, below it puts the December low at $87.56 on the table Ã¢ÂÂ and below that, XLNX could fall into no manÃ¢ÂÂs land.On the upside, see how XLNX handles the 50-day moving average on its eventual retest.	 (NYSE:) beat on earnings, missed on revenue and turned in a , even though free cash flow was strong and the dividend is secure. Shares slipped about 3% for most of the session, with more downside potential on the table.If the stock can reclaim the 100-day and 50-day moving averages, then it puts $39 resistance on the table.Below the 100-day has me more cautious on AT&T in the short term. That caution will intensify should shares fall below uptrend support (blue line). Below that mark puts the $35.50 to $36 area on the table, which has been a rough layer of support since the September gap-up.Below that puts the 200-day moving average in play, and may give long-term investors a solid dip-buying opportunity.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

The Street consensus was calling for earnings near $0.59 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of $731 million. The company also set a low bar for fourth-quarter revenue, aiming for roughly $765 million, while the analyst consensus had pointed to approximately $825 million.Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx pinned the soft revenue on ""global trade headwinds"" and slowdowns in both wired and wireless network deployments. The company is implementing several cost-cutting measures, including a 7% headcount reduction and stricter limits on discretionary expenses. 5G wireless rollouts have been boosting Xilinx's sales in recent quarters and are still seen as a long-term upside, but management said that there's a lull right now between the first and second major waves of 5G installations in key markets like China and South Korea.""The unprecedented change in US-China relations in trade clearly has an impact on the industry and specifically our business, and at a time that's really unfortunate right at the beginning of deployment of 5G,"" CEO Victor Peng said on the .

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Victor Peng, our CEO; and Sumeet Gagneja, our Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. As a search for our new Chief Financial Officer remains ongoing, for this call, Victor will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and the business outlook for the March quarter of fiscal year 2020. Sumeet and I will participate in the Q&A portion of the call, as needed.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents that the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.In addition to GAAP financial measures, we will be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non-recurring unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions. We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website.This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me jump right into our results for the third quarter and provide an update on our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.Overall, the quarter played out largely as we anticipated. Total revenues were $723.5 million, near the midpoint of our expected revenue range. We made a concerted effort to reduce operating expenses and achieved better than expected operating margin and GAAP earnings per share of $0.64, non-GAAP operating earnings per share of $0.68.Now I'll turn to highlights for the third quarter. The Advanced Products category constituted approximately 70% of total revenues in the third quarter, a decrease of 4% year-over-year. Zynq-based revenue grew 26% year-over-year, despite the impact of a weaker Wired and Wireless business. The Zynq SoC platform, which includes Zynq at 28 nanometer and both MPSoC and RFSoC at 16 nanometer, represented 23% of total revenues, which is higher than the year ago period. We continue to see strong Zynq traction across our target markets, which is a positive indicator of our progression transitioning to platforms. Our overall customer engagement momentum continues to build as we position for the long-term profitable growth by executing on our strategy of growth in the data center, 5G and the automotive market, as well as accelerating growth in our core markets.In the Communication markets, we are actively engaged with a global non-Chinese OEM for second-generation 5G radio design that includes beam forming and is based on our 7 nanometer Versal ACAP. Beyond Communication, Versal continues to be well received by customers across several end markets. While production shipments at Versal is expected to begin in late FY '21, we have already recognized initial revenue from early shipments to customers.In the Data Center, Alibaba Cloud announced that Xilinx is powering the data center and is being used by their cloud services enterprise customers. They also shared that unprecedented traffic during Singles Day in China has proven the reliability and security of their systems platform running on our FPGAs. In addition, Supermicro unveiled two new Alveo systems that power compute platforms to accelerate some of the most algorithmically demanding workloads in the enterprise and in the cloud.On the Software front, as announced earlier, the latest Vitis platform is now available for download and free to users who purchased Alveo development board. We also announced the availability of the Vitis AI inference development platform that empowers software developers to utilize deep learning acceleration frameworks like TensorFlow and Caffe. Lastly, we announced our Zynq MPSoC is powering Baidu's production-ready Apollo Computing Unit for automated valet parking, the industry's first dedicated computing solution for this emerging automotive application.Moving to a review of our business groups and core markets of the third quarter. Our core markets performed as expected with some adjustments in mix across our AIT and ABC markets. We saw less than expected declines in A&D and ISM, while macroeconomic and trade related headwinds impacted automotive more than expected. We saw increased revenue from emulation and prototyping customers in TME market, albeit somewhat less than expected. This mix of revenue help to drive a higher blended corporate gross margin in the quarter.The Data Center Group performed as expected and benefited from sales of both compute and networking products to hyperscale customers. Networking revenue from Solarflare somewhat outperformed expectations in the quarter. We also saw increased revenue from customers shipping storage class memory. However, this was offset by weaker demand from high-performance computing and some crypto customers.The Wired and Wireless group performed largely than anticipated, with both wireless and wired down sequentially. Wireless revenue meaningfully declined because of the anticipated baseband ASIC transition and some program related delays with one of our global OEMs.Now moving on to the financials. As I mentioned, total revenue was $723.5 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. Data Center Group revenue increased 8% year-over-year, but was down 16% sequentially from a record quarter. Wired and Wireless group revenue declined 18% year-over-year and was down 29% sequentially. Note that we had one communications customer that represented greater than 10% of revenues in the third quarter. AIT revenue declined 10% year-over-year and it was down 5% sequentially. ABC revenue increased 10% year-over-year and was up 2% sequentially.Gross margin was in line with expectations with GAAP gross margin of 67% and non-GAAP gross margin of 68%. GAAP operating expense at $324 million and non-GAAP OpEx at $318 million were both meaningfully below guidance of $330 million due to significantly reduced hiring and discretionary spending. GAAP operating income was $159 million or 22% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $174 million or 24% operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate was approximately 2% and non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 5%. GAAP net income was $162 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.64, a 31% year-over-year decrease. Non-GAAP net income was $171 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.68, a 26% decline from last year.Diluted share count decreased to 252.8 million and gross cash was $2.4 billion with $1.2 billion in long-term debt. Accounts receivables decreased to $254 million and that is 32 days down from 37 days last quarter. Overall, we generated $324 million in operating cash flow. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $93.70 per share and paid dividends of $93 million.Turning now to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe Q3 will be our low quarter for fiscal '20 from a revenue perspective. However, our revenue recovery is now expected to be more gradual than we had anticipated at the start of last quarter. We expect total fourth quarter revenue to be between $750 million and $780 million, which at the midpoint of the guidance is down approximately 8% year-over-year, but up approximately 6% sequentially. Fourth quarter revenue growth is being driven by meaningful improvement in our core markets and moderate growth in DCG, but is significantly offset by greater than anticipated weakness in WWG. We expect modest growth from our distribution channel.For core markets, we are on track with our prior expectations for strong sequential revenue growth as programs for multiple emulation and prototyping customers ramp. Both A&D and ISM are expected to be up in Q4. Auto is also expected to recover in Q4 as ADAS demand increases relative to Q3. AVB and consumer are expected to be somewhat weaker. For DCG, revenue is expected to grow moderately, albeit somewhat less than prior expectations. We expect continued contributions from compute acceleration, driven by a mix of cloud and high performance compute customers. We expect to see slower revenue ramp from storage and networking customers and we expect additional cloud customer POCs to move into production. But revenue will likely continue to be lumpy given that we're in the early stages of scaling the DCG business.The most significant change to our outlook is in WWG. We now expect Q4 revenue from both Wired and Wireless customers to decline more than previously anticipated. The additional negative impact to our wireless business are result of a slowdown in 5G rollout across multiple regions as many operator take a pause before the next wave of infrastructure deployment. In addition, wired revenues are being impacted by a broad based weakness in demand across multiple customers. Note that these headwinds are in addition to the impact of the loss of revenue from Huawei since last May. We now expect WWG revenue to be down in FY '20 versus FY '19.Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to improve to approximately 69.5%. Given the more persistent revenue headwinds we're facing, we're taking several actions to drive structural operating efficiencies across the company. We plan to reduce our global workforce by approximately 7% through a targeted reduction in force and meaningfully slower attrition replacement. In addition, we are taking several actions to reduce further discretionary spend and realize additional operating efficiencies across the business.Excluding severance charges related to the reduction in force, non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be approximately $318 million, which reflects the adjusted spending profile. This includes approximately $17 million to $20 million of savings from various operating expense reduction actions we plan to take in the fourth quarter. This is offset by expenses related to 7 nanometer tape-out in the quarter and increased legal expenses. Non-GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $8 million due primarily to an anticipated IP settlement for the customer that was recently acquired. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 8%.In closing, we are faced with persistent trade related impacts to our business and other headwind. We are taking thoughtful and decisive actions that, while painful, we believe are in the best interest of all Xilinx's stakeholders. We continue to see a great long-term opportunity and secular growth trends in data center, 5G infrastructure and automotive markets as well as TAM expansion and share gains across our foundational core markets. We remain extremely focused and committed to our strategy to drive profitable growth as a leader in adaptable platforms.Operator, we'll now open the call for questions.The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you. I wonder before you had said that the impact of the baseband transition would be largely done by the March quarter, is that still the case? And what are you kind of thinking about the progression of wireless beyond that, particularly as you know, assuming that we don't get Huawei back into the mix. Can you grow from there? Is it going to take a while? Just what do you think is the progression there? -- Yeah. Joe, I mean, what we said is the baseband impact did occur in the last quarter as expected. So that -- you're correct if you're implying that's not new news. You're right. That's not new news. Really, the additional pressure we're feeling in the current quarter is from slow down in deployments across multiple geographies and then both weakness both on the wireless side as well in the wired side, that level of weakness we did not anticipate last quarter when we kind of gave the overall guide for the second half.In terms of how we see things going forward, we're not giving guidance for FY '21, but I guess broader picture, what I would say is, clearly in the near term, we have some meaningful headwinds here. Huawei remains on the Entity List and that I really think that from that perspective, we don't think about that is even if that were to change in the Entity List that account revenue would be at levels that it used to be. I think it's just the reality of it and that's how we think about it now. However, we're still relatively speaking in the first phase of the point for 5G and you've heard me and I'm sure other people talk about, when we talk to all our customers, they feel like three waves of technology roll-out. And so, it's certainly been more challenge as first wave. When we think about the longer term, we still think this is a good growth opportunity for Xilinx, particularly because we've been innovating with things like RFSoC and Versal ACAP. And we've got really good engagements as I had alluded in my prepared comments, already with some customers for the second-generation and that's actually using our 7 nanometer Versal ACAP. So that's how we think about the big picture. -- Great. And just to clarify my question in terms of the baseband transition. Is that an ongoing headwind beyond the March quarter or the impact of that kind of mostly done in the current quarter? -- I guess, the way we think about it, it's mostly done, it's factored in exactly. If not, it's not like a one-time event, it was -- we expect it would happen -- it did happen in that quarter and we keep it out. -- Okay. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the question. Victor, when you were talking about the Wireless business in your prepared remarks, you talked about the ASIC transition. You mentioned something about a program delay at one of your customers? How significant or insignificant were those two dynamics in the December quarter? And I guess more importantly, at your Investor Day, you guys talked about 3x to 4x more opportunity in 5G relative to 4G given more base stations, higher content and higher market share. Outside of Huawei having issues, has anything changed there or is everything still very much intact long-term? Thank you. -- Sure. Let me deal with the last portion first. It's exactly as you said. Huawei is significant, but if you sort of, OK, understand that and move on from that, we still do think it's a significantly larger opportunity than 4G. Now back to sort of the issue around one customer's program delay, really the bigger -- higher oder bit on the the headwinds that we're seeing in Q4 causing us to see a more gradual recovery from the Q3 which we didn't anticipate was going to be kind of a confluence of kind of a perfect storm thing. It is really the general slowdown in deployment in multiple geographies and that's affected essentially all of the OEMs that we're working with, right, that we're still working with and allowed to work with. The program delay was another factor, but I think the way you should think about it is the highest order bit is just a pause or slower deployment that we are seeing across the -- from the carriers and that's reflected in the OEM customers that we have and multiple of them in all the different regions. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for the question. So I guess, first on WWG. So this pause, is it purely geographic or is it also -- does it have something to do with the applications they're addressing? For example, moving from baseband to remote radio head or to massive-MIMO. And then if you could talk about where we are with RFSoC and how you think that roll out will go? -- Yeah. On the broader question, I don't think it has to do with a roll-out of a particular technology and you're right, there are different types of technologies that fall out of the umbrella of 5G. It just -- it seems as though the multiple operators that cover multiple regions are -- done some initial deployments and are just taking a pause. My position is that they are seeking more profitability before they further invest. But in any event, we talked to you both carriers as well as our OEMs and we see that fairly broad. So I guess, again, then in terms of the longer-term view and all that again, I think that the long-term view still seems very -- like a very good opportunity for us. And again, we have to keep in perspective that we're only in the very first phase and deployments will come back, it's just like we have a pause right now that we didn't anticipate. -- Great. And then on Data Center -- -- I'm sorry, I just really as I didn't quite answer the RFSoC. -- I'm sorry. -- So RFSoC, we do have that being deployed and with different OEMs that cover different multiple regions as well, both in sub-6, but also we think there is some strength there in millimeter wave bands. We're still relatively speaking in the early stages, but it is deployed. So it is out there and in multiple regions and through multiple OEMs. So apologize, I didn't quite cover that initially. -- No problem. Thank you, Victor. And on the Data Center side, nice progress on Alveo cards, but I think in your roadmap, you had AI Core either coming out soon or actually maybe even sampling now, maybe talk about where we are there and have you had any feedback from any hyperscalers or customers? -- Yeah, I think so. I think when you're talking about the AI engine, I think that's respect to our Versal product, and we do have some early Versal development boards. So just to clarify some of the brand names. I think there is good excitement in multiple markets I kind of alluded to the 5G, but certainly in Data Center, that's being evaluated. And also in other markets as well, even in, let's see, one application that even though it's just in the initial silicon people are already doing some deployments in terms of very high resolution camera where they are also doing some image recognition due to some augmented reality for an interesting entertainment experience. And so I think that's a good indicator of not only quality of our initial silicon, but also the breadth that people are using AI on that platform, not just in what's considered the cloud, but maybe you call that -- some people might call that an edge application, right. So, yeah, it's still early days, but we're pretty excited about the diversity and the traction that we're getting. -- Thanks, Victor.Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. -- Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, a question on the restructuring. Can you walk through what is permanent versus temporary and can you help us kind of understand how you will plan to deliver both the operating margins in this more subdued environment as well as obviously invest, I guess most importantly, in the coming SoCs as well as the software stack in the coming few years? Thank you. -- Yeah, C.J., it's a good question. Look, I mean, now when we first started seeing some weakness, we took some proactive actions to control expenses that's reflected in the Q3. Really what happened is late in the year as we saw that some of these headwinds that we just walk through were more severe. And also I think the ongoing persistent effect of the whole China-US trade situation and the Huawei business that I reflected, it was clear that we had to do something that was more structural, right. So it's very painful. Something for us as a company to impact some of our employees, but a good portion of this is a matter of reducing labor and that's both from that targeted reduction in force, as well as significantly controlling even attrition replacement. So that labor component obviously is an ongoing thing.Now some of the other things that we're doing just many other actions in terms of discretionary spend but we also even looked at program, I think that's what you're alluding to. We spent a lot of time thinking about that, of course, because our goal and I think we've achieved that, and how we're coming out here is to not further impact both near-term business nor the grade or long-term opportunity, which we remain very confident in. And I think you heard me mention in the prepared remarks that we expect a certain level of OpEx savings in the quarter, but we're doing a tape out in 7 nanometer in the quarter. So that somewhat offsets all of that.So we are still very much committed to executing to our strategy and I think again there is some difficult decisions here, but I think we've struck a right -- a good balance of things that will bring us in a more reasonable profitability profile, like you said in a more subdued near-term revenue environment, but not in any way materially impacting anything in the future or for that matter even the near-term business. I do think that as we drive and recovering grow out of it, does position us to have maybe more efficiency in the business and leverage because we will watch very carefully our OpEx, even as we get back to a growth trend. -- Thank you. -- Welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open. -- Hi, good afternoon. Could you give us some color on the weakness you see in the Wired business? Also I'm trying to reconcile the commentary that 5G wireless deployments are taking across geographies, but in the US, the ramp has barely started. So maybe if you could elaborate and I know you've already got a few questions on the topic, but if you could elaborate on the reasons for the pause? And when do you expect to rebound and with specifically ramp in the US? -- Yeah. I mean, as you know, we really serve virtually all the OEMs that support all the different geographies, including of course the US and without getting into specific customers, we do see this broad softness and the feedback we're getting is because they are also not seeing some demand materialize across the regions and that includes the US. I do think that this is not necessarily something that is -- it's hard to tell for visibility right now, but I don't think this is something that's going to necessarily persist until the second wave comes. It's just that clearly after they've done some deployment, it just appears from both when we talk to carriers as well as the multiple OEMs that there seems to be a pause now and again where that's we see right now. Yeah, it's hard for us to predict exactly the timing of when that will restart. But again, I will come back to you. When I look at the engagements we already have going actively in the next wave of equipment, I feel good about that we still have good opportunity there. And when there is more deployment, the current generation of equipment, then obviously that could also help our business recover. -- Okay. And then could you give us a quick sense of your mix at 7 nanometer versus 16 nanometer? -- Yeah. 16 nanometer, our portfolio there is on track to break all the records that we have and we hold the most successful product family in the programmable space with our 7 series back in the 28 nanometer generation. We're clearly outpacing that. And that's due not only to the fact that how we executed, but the innovations we have with MPSoC, RFSoC and a number of other areas that's tremendously successful and that revenue is going to continue to grow for some number of years. 7 nanometer, remember is just still in a sampling stage, right. So we're not in production, but we're getting very good traction, I mentioned multiple markets communications and one area that more of a video and broadcast kind of area. Data center, where we're getting good look at aerospace and defense, a lot of strong demand, but that will take time as it usually does for us in some of these markets to ramp to sort of more meaningful revenue. But we have logged revenue already, particularly in the development board. So very encouraging signs. -- Great. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is open. -- Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Victor, I wanted to ask and I guess it's a little bit related to C.J.'s question on the reduction in force, but more specifically, as you guys look at prudent cost cuts and the like going forward, the level of investment and has that level of investment changed in the Vitis software stack that you guys introduced?And I guess the second part of the question is, separate from the investment, how the early engagement has been on that software stack with customers across the business? And if there is anything to highlight there on that progression? That would be really helpful. Thank you. -- Okay, yes. Yeah, thanks. Maybe I didn't touch on that part of it. First, I guess, I really like to say on a relative basis, some of the labor-related reductions that we're doing, on a relative basis we're doing more in SG&A than in R&D in general, OK. We are also again continue to invest in the areas that are critical for our growth.So I think you're both making the point that it's not just silicon road-map, it's also what we're doing on software IP and so forth and we fully agree. So my comments were -- didn't mean to sort of imply that we are just looking at tape out. We are also -- yeah -- we are also focused more on everything we need, all the ONUs that we need to execute our resource strategy and move into platforms and be a much more mainstream targeted platform. Everything we see in terms of, for instance, Vitis, those [Indecipherable] when we announced new webinars and training, they fill out immediately. So that's really encouraging. I know at the end of day everyone as we certainly are looking for the revenue. But when I look at other things to measure in terms of developers, in terms of just hits we get on various videos that we do in training, it's all looking very promising, so. -- Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. In the Data Center portfolio, I wanted to ask if you could give us an update on the traction you guys might be having on the design win side in the SmartNIC space? And if that revenue can be material to the company over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks. -- Yeah. I think I kind of mentioned that for instance, Solarflare revenue last quarter was a little higher than expected. I think that was a record for them. It's till relatively modest revenue. I think that does bode well and we -- that integration is going very well. And clearly, I think, the position will get even stronger when we really fully realize all the positive synergies of their expertise in software and system level expertise with our execution on hardware and platforms. So I do think that think the SmartNIC opportunity is significant. And I think thinking in terms of a year and beyond is reasonable and I think it will be, it will grow for multiple years.And your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open. -- Hi, thank you. Victor, I just had a question on the ASIC transition that you experienced this time. And you said that this was, so this is a one-time and it's done. But when wireless starts to ramp again, why should it not occur again, i.e. you see growth and then you'll see a headwind again. Just kind of help us understand the dynamic and why would this not repeat or would it repeat again? it was my first question.And the second was given the what seems to be a pretty sizable reduction, what does it say about the longer-term mid-teens growth target that you have laid out for the company? Thank you. -- Yeah. Look, on the first part, I think when we said that we expected ASIC replacement in the basement, I think from the very early stages when we had strong upside and in 5G deployment, we said that we ordinarily don't get baseband wins and because there was an early rapid deployment in South Korea and the only way anybody can get to market was they using our technology, which is one of the value adds that we had was we now enable people to be agile and get things to market quickly. We had that, but we didn't expect longevity there. I know it's a competitive marketplace, everybody hears about that. but I want to bring people back to -- we've competed against ASIC at our customers for well over a decade. I mean Huawei has high silicon and has had high silicon for a long time. Clearly, everybody is aware that there was a meaningful impact when we couldn't ship the Huawei and clearly, we weren't totally replaced by ASIC by high silicon Huawei. That's just one example. I mean, I know you guys are familiar with all the other OEMs, they have ASIC teams, right? So, this is nothing new. And I don't take that lightly by any means either. I think we are able to still win against ASIC, even our own customers, because we are continuing to innovate -- innovate with things like RFSoC, with things like Versal on the software and IP side. So yeah, look, I mean, could this happen again? It could. but we traditionally have really good strength in radio. We're innovating, we're moving rapidly and we continue to be very focused on this business. So we maintain that we feel like in the long-term that this is a very big opportunity despite those very significant impacts of the trade situation here.So that was all on the ASIC side, so I'm sorry, can you repeat the second part of your question? -- Yeah. So that's helpful perspective. Thanks for that. What I was asking was given the reduction what seems -- I can't remember the last time we saw such a big reduction for you guys, but what does that speak to the mid-teens growth that you have laid out for the company? -- Yeah, look, we're not -- as I said before, we're not going to give guidance to FY '21 now. We look to do that in the next call. But what I would say is that we absolutely are committed to getting back to double-digit growth. I think this is a recognition of the fact that it's going to come up a little bit more gradually to get to that kind of a run rate. We're committed to doing that and we've recognized that because it is going to take longer. We've had to take some difficult steps here, but I think we're building this to -- continue to execute our strategy and fulfill, I think a very significant opportunity we have not only 5G, but again, data center, our core markets and in automotive as well. -- Okay. Thank you. Good luck. -- Thank you.And your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Hi. This is JiHyung for Ross. Thank you for letting me ask the question. It looks like DCG even with some moderating growth in the March quarter looks to be potentially up 20% for the year versus the prior guidance for up 30%. So I guess what has changed in DCG growth. Are some of the transitions from customer proof of concept to production actually been moving slower than expected previously? -- Yeah. Look, I mean we're not giving you an overall reassessment of that. But I think, the takeaways, it is still growing double-digit. And in fact, when we close out this fiscal year, that'd be two consecutive years of double-digit. I think in general, it's still a reflection as you said some of these things like proof-of-concept have taken a bit longer. I think it's also just, we're growing the business. It's an emerging market. it's not quite at scale where you get the usual puts and takes of certain things are maybe a little bit slower than you get other upsides, it's fairly small business so far in an absolute sense, even though it's growing very well. And I think I've said on a previous call that as we get to higher scale and just more diversity of design wins and different timing of the different programs that we'll see less quarter-to-quarter volatility. But I do think, for the continued near-term, I think the better measure to see is are we sustaining that good double-digit kind of growth and the quality of kind of wins that we get, the engagements that we have and on those basis, we still feel very good about the business. -- Okay. Thank you. And if we just compare as Xilinx's growth to Intel's PSG business, clearly the company, Xilinx has had some good market share gains in the last calendar year. So, I guess even within the head face of Huawei challenges, so, I guess can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic? -- Yes. I mentioned a few times in my prepared remarks that our core markets, it's a key part of our strategy to continue to accelerate growth in our core market. And if you look at how that played out, I mean, our core markets are growing very solidly, right? And to your point, some of that is share gains, some of it's also TAM expansion, right? Those markets have different types of profiles, if you will, in terms of how quickly things move to market. But even in those markets, we're seeing the transitions of Zynq being very, very strong; RFSoC, a strong interest in some early design and activity that haven't fully played out, just because the time constant tends to be a little bit longer, but it's a key to our business and has been progressing quite well and we do fully expect to continue to take share, but also grow the TAM, right.And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Jamie Zakalik on for Vivek. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Is the pace of 5G FPGA replacement similar to the pace that you've seen in past cycles? And is this replacement limited to the baseband? And then on the radio side, do you see Marvell's Avera business as a direct competitor in the digital front-end or is it more a complementary product? -- I guess first, the thing of how to think about is 5G similar to the 4G or what is the level of similarity. And I really must say, I know that there's been a lot of marketing hype around 5G, but I really must say it is a radically more disruptive set of standards and sets of technologies. So I think it is significantly different, which is why we and many other companies have invested so much and are saying how it's going to be changed; once it's fully deployed, how much will it change things from automobiles, the homes, the IoT, it's simply not data and voice, right, which is what 4G is all about. So, I really do think it is meaningfully different even when you cut through some of the marketing buzz. Now, in our side of it, we're also the value we deliver to our customers in 5G is meaningfully different to, meaningfully upgraded, right. A good portion of our products are not just pure FPGAs and our now state-of-the-art FPGAs are so much more powerful than back in the 4G era. So I think on both fronts, the opportunity, the magnitude of disruption is larger. And then what we bring to the table is larger.On the competition side, everybody's up their game. There's a lot of people that have been consolidated out, the players left are pretty good at what they do, right, ourselves included. I don't want to get into specifics about a specific competitor. All I would say again is it's not anything new for us to compete with ASIC solutions with ASSP solutions. including ASIC solutions from our own customers, it's not new. It's not easy and we have to create real value. We have to provide excellent support, great quality and those are the things that we've been doing and that's what we will remain focused on. -- Great. And then a quick follow-up. You mentioned one customer, I think that was greater than 10% of sales in Q3. Could you give some details on who that customer was? Was it Huawei? If not, could you give any details on what percent of revenue Huawei was in the quarter? And just confirm that you're still removing Huawei from forward-looking guide? Thank you. -- Okay. So a quick clarification. We don't have any meaningful revenue from Huawei, because they're still on the Entity List. And we had taken Huawei out starting from the last quarter. My comments about Huawei is really about even on a go-forward basis, even if they were moved from Entity List, it's pretty clear now given that they remain on the Entity List as long as they have that that revenue will never be at the level that we used to have. So it is definitely not Huawei, but we don't share the details of the specific customer for 10%. -- Got it. Thank you.And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Victor Peng, CEO, for some closing remarks. -- Okay. Yeah. Look, before we close the end of this call, I just want to share that clearly we're not where we expect to be if we go back to the start of this fiscal year. I think the unprecedented change in US-China relations in trade clearly has an impact on the industry and specifically, our business and at a time that's really unfortunate right at the beginning of deployment of 5G. We proactively made some very difficult decisions including the very painful one of doing a targeted reduction in force. But I think that is the appropriate thing to do given a slower, a near-term revenue growth trajectory. And I think what that does do is, again position us very well once we get back to a growth trajectory in terms of efficiency in the business and leverage. But I think it's important not to lose sight of the fact that our core markets as we've discussed a few times, both in prepared remarks as well as in the Q&A is very, very solid. It's growing very well on an annual basis. It's a core part of our strategy to accelerate that growth.At the same time, Data Center business, while it's an emerging market and still not fully at scale, tend to have some burstiness [Phonetic] from a quarter-to-quarter basis, it looks like we will achieve double-digit growth on an annual basis for two consecutive years and we continue to see greater opportunity there. And even with 5G, we've talked about that quite a bit. It is important to remember we're still in the relatively early innings on 5G and it started out much stronger and earlier than people predicted. Now, we're having a soft spot, but we're engaged. We have the right kind of engagements with top OEMs and there's still may more innings to come. So, we remain bullish in terms of our overall long-term outlook in those growth drivers.So with that, thank you for being on the call and turn it back over to Matt. -- So, thanks for joining us today.

"Investors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options begin trading today, for the March 6th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new March 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $99.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $99.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $96.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $100.71/share today.

Because the $99.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.02% return on the cash commitment, or 25.59% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $99.50 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $102.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.87.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $100.71/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $102.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.13% if the stock gets called away at the March 6th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $102.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $102.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.85% boost of extra return to the investor, or 24.19% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 52%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 49%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $100.71) to be 37%.

[EditorÃ¢ÂÂs note: Ã¢ÂÂ7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner GeekÃ¢ÂÂ was previously published in November 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]In 2018, chip stocks swooned. It was the beginning of the trade war with China and all the unknowns it brought about.Remember, the one thing the market hates more than anything is uncertainty. And living with the uncertainty of how this powerful industry was going to navigate an all-out Ã¢ÂÂ or even partial Ã¢ÂÂ trade war was on everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs mind.Global economies hadnÃ¢ÂÂt been expanding as quickly as hoped, so spending had slowed. And that meant semiconductor stocks may well have been starting their downward cycle.Smaller firms were spared initially, as the big semi firms took the brunt of it. But then the sector suffered.Since then, things have been entirely different. The iNYSE:) has jumped more than 50% over the past year.Below are seven semiconductor stocks to buy to satisfy your inner geek and your growth portfolio.	 (NASDAQ:) looked like a goner a few years ago.It was competing in two sectors that put it up against the biggest chipmakers out there, plus it was living on scraps from  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) in both the CPU and GPU markets.As the market began to transform with AI, cloud, and IoT gaining momentum, AMD looked like it was a bit lost. It still made quality products but was struggling to keep up. Lisa Su took over in 2015 and started to make changes, it was just a question of whether she could make them before it was too late.ItÃ¢ÂÂs safe to say now, she has.AMD stock is making a comeback and competing again. It has also been beating earnings on a regular basis. AMD stock is up more than 90% year to date and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt show many signs of weakness. All of these factors make AMD one of the key semiconductor stocks to buy. (NASDAQ:) isnÃ¢ÂÂt technically a semiconductor stock, but it falls into the category since its niche doesnÃ¢ÂÂt really fit better anywhere else. At any rate, itÃ¢ÂÂs a great stock to buy.ENPH has become the leading builder of microinverter systems for the solar photovoltaic industry.Basically, when you get energy from solar panels (or most renewables), the electricity is DC (direct current). But the grid, residences, and offices operate on AC (alternating current).You have to convert that DC power to AC to make it useful. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what inverters do.Prices are coming down as more solar is being deployed. ENPH is getting a lot of that new business.What makes this one of the best semiconductor stocks to buy is that itÃ¢ÂÂs already up around 380% over the past year, and this train just started running. (NASDAQ:) is a small analog-to-digital chip maker company in a very high-growth space. Unfortunately, the trade war with China has hamstrung its ability to keep its rapid growth going.IPHI stock has bounced around the past few years but is really coming into its own over the past year.The stock is up 135% in the past year. Its chips are focused on the server, communications and cloud sectors.Like all chip stocks, IPHI took a hit in 2018 when the trade war started because it had big clients in China. The market for its products was growing quickly there as Chinese tech spread across Asia. As tensions ease, though, this is one of the semiconductor stocks to buy you want to keep your eye on.	 (NASDAQ:) is back to focusing on its core technology Ã¢ÂÂ field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These are semiconductors that have become very popular products for a variety of industries.For a while, LSCC was trying to diversify its product lines into various sectors of the tech space, which wasnÃ¢ÂÂt getting much traction. LSCC is now back to focusing on its core business.ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why over the past two years the stock flat-lined for the most part, until 2019 began.Another big part of it was the fact that LSCC has had historically close ties to the Chinese market, so the trade war was a big factor in its performance. But again, uncertainty was more the issue.But now trade war tensions have eased, and the stock has jumped nearly 200% over the last year.(NASDAQ:) is one of the few semiconductor stocks to buy on this list that isnÃ¢ÂÂt rallying like crazy.The reason? One of its top customers happens to be , the massive Chinese telecom company.But thereÃ¢ÂÂs no real reason to be alarmed. This company has a $30 billion market cap, is up 8% over the last year, and sells at a trailing PE of 27.XLNX is a leading chipmaker in two of the hottest sectors right now: 5G telecom and data centers.ThereÃ¢ÂÂs little doubt that XLNX will continue to grow and maintain its position in lead-edge technologies. It might not be growing as quickly as smaller firms in the sector, but itÃ¢ÂÂs a solid, world-class player with a very bright future.	 (NASDAQ:) is whatÃ¢ÂÂs known as a  chipmaker, which essentially means it outsources production of its silicon wafers.From here, things get pretty technical, as its production slate includes codecs for analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converters, smart codecs, boosted amplifiers and haptic drivers, among other integrated circuits (IC).Chances are these ICs are used in your laptop, smartwatch or even your virtual reality (VR) headset, especially if your device is an iPhone.Cirrus LogicÃ¢ÂÂs stock has outperformed over the last year, rising 137%. The performance of CRUS is closely tied to sentiment around (NASDAQ:), which has of course soared in recent months.As demand for iPhones increases, so do Cirrus shares. Some see weakness in Cirrus LogicÃ¢ÂÂs lack of diversification, but if youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be tied down, there are not many companies that are better to be tied to than Apple.	 (NASDAQ:) is an Israel-based chip firm that also produces a number of interconnect and switch systems.Its fundamental purpose is to build support systems that facilitate data transmission between servers, storage systems, telecom and other embedded equipment. This is a very important bridge technology that allows all the tech on one side to get its information to the other side.In March, NVDA announced it was buying MLNX for $6.9 billion. INTC had tried to buy it in January but was rebuffed. Other suitors included  (NASDAQ:) and XLNX. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a very sought-after company.While the company sells for around $119 a share, that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt exactly equate to where the stock will eventually land.At this point, MLNX is a stock to buy and an interesting way to buy into NVDA. This is a key player in a very important sector of tech moving forward.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek@2020-01-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-for-your-inner-geek-2020-01-14

2019 was a turbulent year for the semiconductor industry, to say the least. Trade issues between the US and China, slowing demand for smart devices, and tumbling memory chip prices all played their part. However, the industry has continued to exhibit strong growth. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index’s (SOX) 60% gain easily beats the S&P 500’s impressive 29% increase this year.As the 2020s kick into gear, the industry stands to benefit from several tailwinds: the wider deployment of 5G networks, the increasing amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and storages - all of which count on the semiconductor industry.Against this backdrop, investment firm Rosenblatt Securities recently issued a report with the firm's three semiconductor picks for 2020. Using TipRanks’  tool, we lined up the three alongside each other and got the lowdown on what the new decade has in store for the firm’s choices. Let’s take a look.One of the past year’s best performers is semiconductor powerhouse Advanced Micro Devices. Gaining 148%, it was one of the S&P 500’s most impressive growth stories in 2019.Throughout the year, the company fired on all fronts; AMD has taken advantage of Intel’s shortages in the low end of the PC market and has bitten a decent chunk out of its rival’s market dominance; It has partnered with Google on its Stadia cloud gaming service, which uses a custom AMD GPU; Tencent announced its cloud-computing service will use AMD’s second-generation EPYC processors. Furthermore, the company has seen new products such as the Ryzen third generation processors fly off the shelves.Following all the good news, is AMD about to slow down in 2020? Not according to Rosenblatt’s , who thinks AMD is “poised for P/E multiple expansion in 2020.”The analyst said, “We view 2020 as a year that will continue the early momentum in CPU share gains in 7nm desktops/servers, and see limited competitive threats slowing the momentum train for the upcoming new 7nm mobile Ryzen. In a narrative that has yet to gain traction or interest from the Street, we see AMD’s roadmaps as unique and strong in both x86 CPUs and GPUs, which have a fundamental advantage in high performance computing (the Frontier supercomputer, for example, uses tightly coupled AMD CPUs and GPUs), and have yet to be copied (Intel has tried the GPU dance for 20 years) or are not legally possible (lack of an x86 license) for Nvidia.”Accordingly, then, the 5-star analyst reiterated a Buy rating on AMD along with a price target of $65, implying potential upside of 42%. (To watch Mosesmann’s track record, )But the Street does not share this optimism, as the consensus price target of $40.24 suggests a downside potential of nearly 18% from the current share price. This could be due to several reasons; either AMD has soared so high during 2019 that a number of analysts think the time for a pullback is near, or that some have simply not updated their models, yet. Either way, it remains to be seen if the bulls or the bears dictate AMD’s upcoming year. ()A fellow chipmaker beating the rest of the market in 2019 is Micron. The memory chip specialist closed out the year up 69% despite some serious headwinds along the way.The company took a hit earlier in the year when it had to suspend shipments to its Chinese client, Huawei, as a result of the US-China trade war. Additionally, an oversupply on top of a lack of demand, bought memory chip prices down. Of the former, Micron was able to circumvent the embargo by exploiting a loophole which showed that a “subset of current products” was not “subject to export administration regulations and entity list restrictions.” Of the latter, Rosenblatt's Mosesmann notes, “We saw clear incremental market signals of shortages (in server DRAM and NAND SSDs), contract prices starting to improve, and Micron/industry supply discipline pointing to a desirable and broader S/D balance as 2020 plays out.”Mosesmann added, “Cycle naysayers or investors looking for broad and unambiguous evidence of a cycle turn will miss the next significant move in the shares, we believe, and it is their timidity that provides us the opportunity entering 2020. Micron is clearly a better company in virtually all dimensions, with a richer/stickier product stack, a model that is delivering 50% FCF to investors, and sports an investment grade credit rating from the three key major credit agencies.”The bullish thesis has the Rosenblatt analyst reiterating a Buy on Micron stock alongside a $100 price target. Should the target be met, investors will be taking home over 80% gain in the coming year.The Street is with the bulls on Micron but is not quite as enthusiastic as Mosesmann. The analysts’ average price target comes in at $62.36 and presents upside potential of 13% from current levels. ()Not quite hitting the giddy heights of Rosenblatt’s two previous choices is chipmaker Xilinx. The FPGA circuit inventor finished 2019 up by 15%, way behind the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index’s gain.So, what gives? Xilinx made a strong start to the year following the deployment of 5G networks in South Korea, but the company was hit hard by the trade war. Unlike Micron, it was unable to resume its shipments to Huawei.With the tensions between the two superpowers easing and 5G set for wider roll out across different countries in 2020, Xilinx, according to Rosenblatt’s Hans Mosesmann, stands to benefit. The analyst said, “We see 5G stabilizing in 2020 and continue to view the 5G cycle for Xilinx to be several times larger than current ~$400 million/year baseline 4G business.”Furthermore, Mosesmann pushes the bullish case by noting “FPGAs are at the very early innings of a secular growth dynamic in compute acceleration.”“FPGAs appear to be in the early days of a next wave in computing, reminiscent of when compute GPUs inflected 5-7 years ago for Nvidia (with massive attendance growth at the GPU Technology Conference events), coincident with the decline and eventual cancellation of the Intel Developer Forum (IDF),” the 5-star analyst further added.Xilinx, therefore, is a top pick for Mosesmann, who reiterated a Buy rating on the stock alongside a price target of $165. This conveys the analyst’s belief that the chipmaker can soar nearly 70% in 2020.Following the pattern to a T, the rest of the Street is positive on XLNX, but not quite to the same extent. The Street’s average price target of $111.85 indicates that upside of 11% could materialize over the next 12 months.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"  and   faced identical challenges in 2019 thanks to the U.S.-China trade war. The chipmakers had to  as the Chinese telecom giant was added to the U.S. government's Entity List. Micron faced  of tumbling memory prices in light of weak demand and oversupply.Micron, however, seems to have turned a corner. The stock has regained its mojo of late thanks to . But Xilinx investors haven't benefitted from the same level of interest and the stock continues to languish after showing great promise earlier in 2019.But does this make Xilinx a bad bet when compared to Micron, especially considering that both companies stand to gain from identical catalysts? Let's find out. data by Micron Technology is back in the good graces of investors as it claims that its financial woes will bottom out in the current quarter. CFO David Zinsner made this clear on the Q1 fiscal 2020  in mid-December:However, we are encouraged by recent market trends and expect that [Q2 fiscal 2020] will be the bottom of our gross margins, as pricing, an increasing mix of high-value solutions, and cost reductions drive better gross margins throughout the rest of fiscal and calendar 2020. We expect a gradual recovery to start in FQ3, and to continue into the seasonally stronger second half of calendar year.Zinsner also added that price declines of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) have decelerated, while NAND flash memory prices are on the rise. Micron believes that the memory market's demand/supply balance will keep improving thanks to increased demand from data centers, fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, and console gaming.Image Source: Getty ImagesMicron says that DRAM content in data centers is increasing thanks to the need for more memory and storage capabilities to tackle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. As a result, the amount of DRAM used by a typical cloud server should increase. Micron management believes that demand for cloud DRAM could grow at a faster pace than the company's own forecast next year.Data centers could also drive Micron's NAND flash business next year as they turn to solid-state drives (SSDs) to enable faster performance and low power consumption. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra pointed out that the ""average density, as well as the average usage of flash in clouds and data center applications, continues to increase.""According to a ResearchAndMarkets.com estimate, flash storage in data centers is expected to increase at an annual rate of nearly 17% through 2024. This should pave the way for continued improvements in Micron's NAND flash business.Finally, the memory specialist's DRAM business will get a shot in the arm from the arrival of 5G smartphones next year. Seoul-based financial services provider KIWOOM Securities estimates that demand for mobile DRAM is on track to jump 22% next year as 5G devices gain critical mass. Micron is now in a stronger position to take advantage of that growth as the company has been granted permission to ship to Huawei.All of this indicates that the demand/supply balance in the memory industry should continue to improve in the coming quarters and help Micron turn its business around.Xilinx was an early beneficiary of 5G networks. The company clocked tremendous growth when deployment of 5G networks began in South Korea in early 2019, but it  thanks to the broader semiconductor slowdown and restrictions imposed on Huawei.Xilinx pointed out in October that it  from the Commerce Department that would have allowed it to resume shipments to Huawei. As a result, the company had to recalibrate its guidance for the full year as Huawei was anticipated to account for 6% to 8% of the company's total revenue this year.But now that Micron has posted a positive development on the Huawei front in the wake of the U.S.-China trade deal, Xilinx could get back its mojo as well. More importantly, Xilinx's 5G business can get a shot in the arm next year as 5G deployments are expected to gather pace in more countries.So far, the chipmaker has benefited from 5G deployments in China and South Korea, and in Japan to some extent. A  report points out that 5G deployments in countries such as the U.A.E., Spain, Qatar, Sweden, Germany, and France will gain pace in 2020. As a result, 5G wireless infrastructure investments could swell from an estimated $2.2 billion this year to nearly $4.2 billion in 2020.This means that Xilinx's 5G opportunity is still alive. The possible restart of shipments to Huawei and acceleration in 5G deployments could continue to fire up the chipmaker's wireless networks business in 2020.Meanwhile, the 5G bump could also drive up demand for Xilinx's field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips. We have already seen that data center upgrades are in the cards in a bid to tackle more complex workloads thanks to AI. Now, FPGAs are turning out to be a key component of AI-focused data centers, as they are capable of accelerating workloads with less power consumption., for instance, recently deployed FPGAs in Advanced Query Accelerator (AQUA) -- a new Amazon Web Services (AWS) application. Amazon claims that AQUA is 10 times faster than its rivals, which is proof that using FPGAs in data centers has its advantages.Not surprisingly, a third-party research report points out that FPGAs are going to be the fastest-growing data center accelerators in the coming years. This is great news for Xilinx as the data center accelerator market itself is expected to grow at almost 50% a year through 2023, according to the report.All these catalysts could help Xilinx step up its game next year. According to analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance, Xilinx's top-line growth could hit almost 10% in the coming fiscal year after this year's 6% growth.It can be concluded that both Xilinx and Micron are turnaround plays. But which of these two stocks are worth betting on depends on an investor's risk profile. That's because Xilinx is the safer bet as it has managed to deliver double-digit revenue growth in difficult times, while Micron's performance has been way off the mark. data by Micron's dependency on the memory price cycle is a risk that investors need to watch. If memory prices don't recover as the memory specialist anticipates, its rally could fizzle out next year. Xilinx, on the other hand, isn't dependent on any such cycle. The company looks poised to take advantage of secular growth trends in 5G and data centers, so it could turn out to be a  in 2020 as compared to Micron.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

U.S. equities made another new high on Friday â and no, I didnât just copy and paste that from every other day this week. That said, itâs pretty clear bulls are in control at the moment. Letâs look at a few top stock trades for Monday, the last full trading day before the holidays.	Itâs a Christmas miracle, with (NYSE:) finally putting together some bullish developments.Earlier this month, the stock notched a higher low, allowing us to draw an uptrend mark (purple line) on the chart. Then it pushed through the 50-day moving average and the $30 level.Obviously the stock still has a lot to prove, but itâs making positive steps. Itâs also a great example of why traders should keep an open mind and do their best to approach each stock without a bias.If Uber can stay above $30, the 61.8% retracement at $33.79 may be the next stop. On a move below $30 and the 50-day moving average, see if uptrend support buoys the name.	Man, (NASDAQ:) has been on a tear lately. Just earlier this month, it was flirting with a breakdown below $290. Now up near $336, the rally has added almost $50 to the stock price.Is it running out of gas?Earlier this year, the $340 level was big-time support, along with the 200-day moving average. NFLX didnât have much trouble reclaiming the latter, but as it nears the former in an overbought condition, prudent bulls are surely raising stops and booking some profits.If NFLX surges through $340, a gap-fill up near $360 will surely be bullsâ preferred target. If $340 is resistance, see if the 200-day moving average acts as support. Below puts uptrend support in play.	Not one we visit with often, but (NASDAQ:) was popping up on tradersâ radars Friday.After breaking out over downtrend resistance earlier this month, shares have been consolidating in a tight range between $96 and $97.50. Moving out of it now, it faces a big test of $100.Over that mark, and bulls will look to fill the September gap up toward $103, then possibly take shares up to the 200-day moving average.If XLNX canât break out over $100, see that it holds up near its prior consolidation zone (between $96 and $97.50). Below puts the 50-day moving average on the table, and below that, $90 range support could be next.	(NASDAQ:) continues to make beautiful move after beautiful move. The latest comes on Friday, as shares break out of a bullish pennant and race to new highs.From here, AMD could kickstart another rally, possibly above $45. The higher it goes, the more traders are going to be pushing for $50.On a pullback, though, see that it finds support from the rising 20-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Below that and the prior high area between $41.79 and $41 needs to support AMD. Otherwise, it may need more time to consolidate.Until then though, letâs try not to get too bearish. The whole market has been strong and being too early to the party â either bulls on a pullback or bears on a rally â can result in a nasty burn to the ego and the brokerage account. They say âdonât fight the trendâ for a reason.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of  and is on Twitter .

"ech investors have laughed all the way to the bank in 2019, as evident from the  index's impressive gains. But not all tech stocks have managed to create wealth for investors despite starting 2019 on the front foot.  ,  , and   shareholders would have expected market-beating performances, but that didn't happen. The initial promise shown by these stocks eventually faded away. data by However, don't be surprised to see all three companies stage a strong comeback in 2020 and turn into . Let me explain why.Xilinx was a hot growth stock at the beginning of 2019. The deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) wireless networks gave the chipmaker , helping it deliver rapid top- and bottom-line growth. But adversity soon struck thanks to the U.S.-China trade war.Xilinx  anymore to Huawei, which has been playing a critical role in 5G deployments in China. At the same time, the company saw  as customers started transitioning to custom chips made specifically for 5G applications from the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that Xilinx makes.Image Source: Getty Images..However, the chipmaker remains confident that 5G will continue to remain a catalyst for Xilinx in the long run. And don't be surprised to see Xilinx's 5G catalyst step up big-time in 2020, as telecom operators are expected to spend a lot more money on related wireless infrastructure next year.According to Gartner's estimates, worldwide 5G wireless network infrastructure revenue is expected to hit nearly $4.2 billion in 2020, significantly higher than 2019's estimated revenue of $2.2 billion.What's more, 5G infrastructure spending will likely continue to rise at a rapid pace in 2021 and hit $6.8 billion. This massive jump in 5G infrastructure spending will be driven by network rollouts in more regions such as Germany, Canada, France, Spain, the Middle East, and others. In 2019, 5G deployments have primarily happened in South Korea, Japan, and the U.S.So, 2020 might be the year when 5G network deployment gains critical mass and open up a bigger market for Xilinx. This could give the chipmaker's financials a nice bump, as 38% of its revenue comes from the wireless business that recorded terrific annual growth of 24% in the last reported quarter. 5G rollout in newer markets will spur demand for Xilinx's programmable chips and help the company infuse some momentum into its top- and bottom-line growth once again.Twilio was my . The cloud communications specialist looked all set to build upon 2018's terrific rally, as it was clocking rapid growth. The good news is that the cloud communications specialist has sustained its impressive growth rate this year, but that  the market's expectations.Meanwhile, Twilio's management gave investors another shock recently when it downgraded its fiscal 2019 earnings guidance thanks to what it calls . All of this seems to have dented investor confidence in Twilio, but savvy investors should capitalize on the stock's recent decline.That's because Twilio's growth won't be slowing down anytime soon. The company projects $1.15 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019, an increase of 71% over 2018. For comparison, Twilio had clocked 63% revenue growth in 2018, meaning that the company has switched up a gear thanks to the acquisition of email marketing player SendGrid that was completed in January 2019.SendGrid has added  to Twilio's client base. This gives Twilio a nice head start into the email marketing business that's growing at almost 20% a year, according to Transparency Market Research. Concurrently, Twilio has a new product to sell to its organic customer base and vice versa.So, the synergies of the SendGrid acquisition have the potential to help Twilio sustain its impressive pace of growth in the new year. Elsewhere, Twilio's core business of providing a cloud communications platform will be yet another growth driver.Twilio is primarily known for being the middleman that delivers push notifications, messages, voice calls, videos, and other content to users within apps such as , , , and others. This is a fast-growing space that's expected to clock an annual growth rate of 26% through 2023, according to a third-party estimate.In the end, it can be concluded that Twilio is plying its trade in markets that are growing at an impressive pace. So don't be surprised to see Twilio become a growth stock next year, since it has enough catalysts to overcome its recent troubles.After , Glu Mobile was tepid this year.

 (NASDAQ:) fell from grace last October into a 57% correction where Nvidia stock lost more than half its value. At the peak, the love for NVDA on Wall Street was extreme. All experts agreed at the time that it belonged in every portfolio. But what ensued was a tremendous correction that overshot to the downside. After all the damage was done, Nvidia stabilized at the breakout neckline from May of 2017.	Since then, the stock has been setting higher-lows in an effort to recover prior glories. But it still has a long way to go.NVDA didn’t fall alone, the whole stock market also tripped at the same time in October of 2018. But the difference is that the indices are back to new all-time highs, whereas Nvidia stock just got back to the 50% retracement level.And for those who follow Fibonacci, this is not an ideal place to start a bullish position. Even though it is in a breakout off $140 per share, going into its earnings management will need to deliver a very bullish outlook for the stock to rally much further from here.If I have profits in the stock, I would lock them in going into the binary event. Wall Street investors are fickle around earnings. And the subsequent moves more often than not involve sentiment rather than facts.Then there is the matter of geopolitical risk. The chip stocks are very sensitive to the rhetoric from the economic war with China. And lately the politicians have been cordial on the subject, but this can flip on a dime. However going into an election season, the U.S. is more likely to loosen the reins on the deal with China. So what has been holding down the sector and stocks like Nvidia,  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) may be abating.There is more upside to come in NVDA stock, but it’s more about timing. The zone through $220 per share is resistive. But the reins are in the hands of the bulls for as long as it stays above $180 per share. So even if there is a dip on the earnings event, it would make for a good entry point for a bounce. And maybe the next leg higher would break through the resistance above. The important thing is that technically it continues to set higher-lows in order to continue the bullish progress in the stock. It is also important that management doesn’t deliver surprisingly bad news.AMD has been the chip champ as it just set new highs. Intel comes in a close second as it has completely recovered from last year. Nvidia is still lagging as it needs another 40% rally from here to reach its October accident scene. So maybe it has a catch-up play in the making but one that could be made or broken the morning after the earnings.This is a good company with good products in an industry that will be in high demand for decades. But it is not cheap. It has a price-to-earnings ratio of 54 and sells at 11 times sales. This is three times more expensive than INTC, but gives AMD a run for its money there. They are both frothy, so there is some fat to trim, especially if the headlines sour once more.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

That's not to say there aren't high-quality companies that will go on to deliver strong performance over the long term, but stocks that appear to offer big discounts are in shorter supply compared with just a few years ago.Finding cheap stocks is even harder if you're looking for growth plays that have what it takes to deliver explosive returns. Allocating more space in your portfolio for defensive investments may be a sensible move at this stage, but investors seeking big gains still have some promising options on the table.

And it provides a range of other e-commerce support services including marketing, customer service, and order fulfillment. The company has primarily been focused on helping major Western brands like , , and  expand their presence in China's fast-growing online retail market, and the trust that large companies have put in its services have helped the stock deliver impressive growth since its market debut in 2015.Baozun's share price has climbed roughly 150% over the last three years alone, but uncertainty stemming from the fraught trade situation between the U.S. and China, the exiting of a large electronics brand from the company's platform, and slower-than-expected growth in services revenue have tamped down on the stock recently. It is down about 10% over the last 18 months, is roughly flat over the last year, and trades down 46.5% from its lifetime high. The departure of a major electronics brand from the platform is disappointing any way you slice it, as the stickiness of Baozun's online retail and services ecosystem has been part of the stock's appeal. Based on some analysis and reports, it appears that the brand partner that left the platform may be Chinese hardware giant Huawei. That loss would be a significant setback, but signs still point to major Western brands putting their faith in Baozun. And the value that the e-commerce services company provides to companies outside China has always been at the center of its growth story.The business added 11 net brand partners  to bring its total to 223, up 69% from the end of Q3 2018. Despite the departure of that electronics brand partner from the platform, Baozun continues to bring new partners on board, so the pillars of a bullish position on Baozun appear to be intact. China's projected GDP growth of 6.25% this year still looks relatively brisk compared with U.S. numbers, and nearly 18% growth for online retail sales in the country across the first half of 2019 reinforces a healthy outlook for e-commerce despite the trade squeeze. The country's per-capita GDP has risen from $156 in 1978 to roughly $10,000 today, and it looks like the country's middle class is on track to continue seeing increased per-capita discretionary spending in the coming decades.If you're looking for stocks with big growth potential that trade at a discount, Baozun is a standout candidate.  is another stock that has felt pressure from the U.S.-China trade war, with shares climbing just 6% on the year despite the chipmaker's compelling product line and a roughly 25% rise for the  index level across the stretch. Xilinx's relatively weak performance this year looks even more notable in light of a rally for the broader semiconductor space, with the  climbing 47% in 2019 so far.The programmable-chip specialist's shares trade at a 36% discount from the lifetime high of $141.60 they hit in April. Xilinx's role in 5G network expansion and artificial intelligence mean that it's under more pressure than most other players in the semiconductor industry because these are areas of competition for the U.S. and China. But the stock could turn into a big winner for patient investors. Xilinx's leading position in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, its recently debuted adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP) for AI, and an expanding lineup of autonomous-vehicle-focused chips position it to play a key role in some of the most important  of the next decade. The near-term downside from the significance of its products is that the chipmaker is less likely to get exemptions from the Commerce Department ban on dealing with Huawei -- and potentially other large Chinese tech companies if the trade situation worsens.The heightened trade barriers and halt to business with Huawei have put a significant damper on the company's near-term sales and earnings outlook. The stock's weak performance this year isn't surprising within that context, but Xilinx remains a category leader, and shares look cheap despite the added uncertainty.The company's growth is going to be lumpy, and recent sell-offs reflect the unwillingness of some investors to wait out potentially turbulent times. But Xilinx has a clear lead in programmable chips, and there's a good chance that will pay off in the long run. Its solutions should see increased demand in order to support applications in data centers, connected cars, aerospace, and telecommunications.Xilinx also pays a dividend. Its 1.6% yield might not look like much, but the company has hiked its payout annually for nine years running, and an annualized dividend that comes in at roughly 38% of free cash flow suggests the chipmaker can continue boosting its returned-income component while developing new products to power its next growth stages. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"[Editor’s note: “7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek” was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Last year saw chip stocks swoon. There was the beginning of the trade war with China and all the unknowns it brought about.Remember, the one thing the market hates more than anything is uncertainty. And living with the uncertainty of how this powerful industry was going to navigate an all-out – or even partial – trade war was on everyone’s mind.Global economies haven’t been expanding as quickly as hoped, so spending has slowed. And that meant semiconductor stocks may well be starting their downward cycle.Smaller firms were spared initially, as the big semi firms took the brunt of it. But then the sector suffered.This year is entirely different. The  has returned a whopping 43.8% year to date, more than doubling the ’s 21%.Even the  won’t slow them down now. Below are seven semiconductor stocks to buy to satisfy your inner geek and your growth portfolio.Source: Shutterstock
	 (NASDAQ:) looked like a goner a couple years ago.It was competing in two sectors that put it up against the biggest chipmakers out there, plus it was living on scraps from  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) in both the CPU and GPU markets.As the market began to transform with AI, cloud, and IoT gaining momentum, AMD looked like it was a bit lost. It still made quality products but was struggling to keep up. Lisa Su took over in 2015 and started to make changes, it was just a question of whether she could make them before it was too late.It’s safe to say now, she has.AMD stock is making a comeback and competing again. It has also been beating earnings on a regular basis. AMD stock is up more than 90% year to date and doesn’t show many signs of weakness. All of these factors make AMD one of the key semiconductor stocks to buy. (NASDAQ:) isn’t technically a semiconductor stock, but it falls into the category since its niche doesn’t really fit better anywhere else. At any rate, it’s a great stock to buy.ENPH has become the leading builder of microinverter systems for the solar photovoltaic industry.Basically, when you get energy from solar panels (or most renewables), the electricity is DC (direct current). But the grid, residences, and offices operate on AC (alternating current).You have to convert that DC power to AC to make it useful. That’s what inverters do.Prices are coming down as more solar is being deployed. ENPH is getting a lot of that new business.What makes this one of the best semiconductor stocks ti buy is that it’s already up around 70% year to date and this train just started running. (NASDAQ:) is a small analog-to-digital chip maker company in a very high-growth space. Unfortunately, the trade war with China has hamstrung its ability to keep its rapid growth going.IPHI stock has bounced around the past few years but is really coming into its own over the past year.The stock is up 85% in the past year and 120% year to date. Its chips are focused in the server, communications and cloud sectors.Like all chip stocks, IPHI took a hit last year when the trade war started because it had big clients in China. The market for its products was growing quickly there as Chinese tech spread across Asia. As tensions ease, though, this is one of the semiconductor stocks to buy you want to keep your eye on.Source: Shutterstock
	 (NASDAQ:) is back to focusing on its core technology – field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These are semiconductors that have become very popular products for a variety of industries.For a while, LSCC was trying to diversify its product lines into various sectors of the tech space, which wasn’t getting much traction. LSCC is now back to focusing on its core business.That’s why over the past two years the stock flat-lined for the most part, until 2019 began.Another big part of it was the fact that LSCC has had historically close ties to the Chinese market, so the trade war was a big factor in its performance. But again, uncertainty was more the issue.By January, the trade war fallout was clear and resetting expectations boosted LSCC. The stock is up 180% year to date and looks well-positioned to get moving again. It’s a stock to buy.(NASDAQ:) is one of the few semiconductor stocks to buy on this list that isn’t rallying like crazy.The reason? One of its top customers happens to be , the massive Chinese telecom company.But there’s no real reason to be alarmed. This company has a $30 billion market cap, is up 44% year to date, and sells at a trailing PE of 35.XLNX is a leading chipmaker in two of the hottest sectors right now: 5G telecom and data centers.There’s little doubt that XLNX will continue to grow and maintain its position in lead-edge technologies. It might not be growing as quickly as smaller firms in the sector, but it’s a solid, world-class player with a very bright future.Source: 
	 (NASDAQ:) is what’s known as a  chipmaker, which essentially means it outsources production of its silicon wafers.From here, things get pretty technical, as its production slate includes codecs for analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converters, smart codecs, boosted amplifiers and haptic drivers, among other integrated circuits (IC).Chances are these ICs are used in your laptop, smartwatch or even your virtual reality (VR) headset, especially if your device is an iPhone.Cirrus Logic’s stock has outperformed in 2019, rising 100% year-to-date. The performance of CRUS is closely tied to sentiment around (NASDAQ:), up 30%-plus.As demand for iPhones increases, so do Cirrus shares. Some see weakness in Cirrus Logic’s lack of diversification, but if you’re going to be tied down, there are not many companies that are better to be tied to than Apple.Source: Shutterstock
	 (NASDAQ:) is an Israel-based chip firm that also produces a number of interconnect and switch systems.Its fundamental purpose is to build support systems that facilitate data transmission between servers, storage systems, telecom and other embedded equipment. This is a very important bridge technology that allows all the tech on one side to get its information to the other side.In March, NVDA announced it was buying MLNX for $6.9 billion. INTC had tried to buy it in January but was rebuffed. Other suitors included  (NASDAQ:) and XLNX. It’s a very sought-after company.While the company sells for around $114 a share, that doesn’t exactly equate to where the stock will eventually land.At this point, MLNX is a stock to buy and an interesting way to buy into NVDA. This is a key player in a very important sector of tech moving forward.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek@2019-11-08@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-for-your-inner-geek-2019-11-08
"he U.S.-China trade war is turning out to be a vulnerability for  . The chipmaker had  that the dispute could knock the wind out of its sails, since it had to suspend its shipments to Huawei. But the company's latest results show the extent to which trade tensions are hurting the business.Xilinx's second-quarter net income increased 8% to $0.94 per share thanks to a 12% jump in revenue to $833 million. But that's where the good news ends.Image source: Getty Images.It expects third-quarter revenue between $710 million and $740 million, missing Wall Street's expectation of $845 million by a huge margin. The chipmaker had delivered $800 million in revenue in the prior-year period, along with earnings of $0.92 per share, which means that it anticipates a 9% decline in revenue this quarter.Moreover, the fact that Xilinx didn't provide an estimate for earnings per share adds to the uncertainty. That's not surprising, as management was  three months ago, stating that it was able to mitigate the Huawei-related losses thanks to global 5G deployments. This seemed like a logical explanation as Xilinx boasted of having no customer accounting for 10% or more of its business in the first quarter.The company has also indicated that it was anticipating Huawei to supply no more than 6% to 8% of total revenue this fiscal year.Xilinx had found a way to circumvent the restrictions on shipping to Huawei. It was able to ship certain products after carefully reviewing the restrictions, and had also applied to the Commerce Department for licenses in a bid to expand the number of products it can ship to the Chinese company. But Xilinx has faced rejection from the Commerce Department, forcing it to take Huawei out of the equation. CEO Victor Peng highlighted this on the latest , saying, ""While we expedited our application process to the Department of Commerce in early Q2, we have not received any license approvals to expand the product set permissible to sell to Huawei.""He added that Xilinx is removing ""all remaining revenue expectations"" from Huawei for the current fiscal year. The company now expects full-year revenue of nearly $3.25 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a mid-single-digit improvement over its fiscal 2019 revenue.But that's entirely different from the manner in which Xilinx had started 2019. The chipmaker was enjoying rapid top- and bottom-line growth thanks to the rollout of 5G networks. But it looks like the 5G catalyst is now cooling off. According to Peng: ""Our first-half wirelessrevenue benefit from early 5G deployments, mainly in South Korea and China, and a modest amount in other markets. Our second half is more challenging given the expected based on [application-specific integrated circuit] transition and unexpected program delays with some communication customers."" The transition to application-specific integrated circuits was always going to  for Xilinx. Moreover, the unexpected delays Peng is talking about suggest that telecom companies are probably holding back their spending in light of the tepid global economic growth.Xilinx believes that the 5G catalyst will come back as the global rollout gains momentum. However, management's tone indicates that it expects bumps along the way. Peng says that 5G presents ""a significant opportunity"" for Xilinx in the long run, but it will ""continue to be somewhat lumpy.""It is evident that Xilinx's growth isn't going to be as attractive as it seemed just a couple of quarters ago. The trade war uncertainty and the negative macroeconomic vibes could continue to weigh on the stock.But investors shouldn't forget that Xilinx is sitting on . The company's dominance in programmable chips and fast-growing semiconductor verticals  could help Xilinx step on the gas once the current slowdown is over. data by The stock has lost nearly 18% of its value in the past six months, and the  has dropped significantly. The bad news seems already baked in as Xilinx has removed Huawei from the equation. So it might be a good idea to hold onto the stock, since it could fly once again when business conditions improve. It could return to its past as a , but it's going to take time for things to turn back in its favor. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ith catalysts like the expansion of the internet, the rise of personal computers and mobile devices, and rapid growth for e-commerce and software-as-a-service businesses, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the technology sector has outperformed all others over the last couple of decades. That could very well be true over the next two decades as well.There's a good chance that technology companies will continue to lead the market as they help create and benefit from far-reaching trends that unlock new potential across industries. With that in mind, growth-focused investors looking for long-term plays in the tech space may want to consider adding  ,  , and   to their portfolios.Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx is a semiconductor company that's best known for pioneering, and continuing to lead, the market for field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips. These programmable semiconductors offer superior versatility and can provide better performance than generalized integrated circuits after they've been tailored to complete a user's desired tasks. FPGAs have gained favor in the telecommunications industry because some functional changes can be made quicker and more cost effectively than would be possible with general or application-specific circuits, and it looks like demand for this category of chips is set to grow substantially.Xilinx's FPGA hardware is seeing increased adoption from large data-enter customers like , , and . And its leadership position in this corner of the chip market positions the company for impressive long-term growth as businesses build out their cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.The chipmaker has also branched into new hardware family designs, having recently launched its AI-focused adaptive-compute-acceleration-platform (ACAP) chips. The company estimates that its new Versal ACAP chips are capable of carrying out processes for data center functions, 5G, wired networks, and automated driver assist programs at speeds that are 20 times faster than the best FPGA systems and over 100 times faster than traditional central processing units. With a market capitalization of roughly $24.5 billion, Xilinx isn't a small company, but it still has lots of room to grow as its products see increased demand tied to data centers, AI, and new networking technologies. Xilinx also sports a 1.5% dividend yield and a 14-year history of annual payout growth, giving the stock a significant returned-income component in addition to big growth potential. Shares trade at roughly 28 times this year's expected earnings.Trade uncertainties have loomed over  and added downward pressure on stocks that might otherwise be putting up stronger performance. E-commerce player JD.com has managed to rally roughly 50% across 2019 after getting rocked by sell-offs in the second half of last year, but shares are still down roughly 25% since the start of 2018 -- and 38% from their all-time high. Investors should approach JD with the understanding that the road to big returns could be bumpy and see outsize impact from macroeconomic shifts, but the prospects remain appealing. JD's focus on high-quality electronics and consumer goods has helped differentiate its e-commerce platform from competitors like  and Alibaba's Taobao (which both have reputations for featuring counterfeit and low-quality products). And the business looks primed for big long-term growth as China's online retail market continues to expand. The focus on quality products and reliable service will likely work in the company's favor as incomes rise for Chinese citizens and per-capita discretionary spending increases.JD should benefit from internet use and shopping trends as well. Roughly 800 million people out of China's 1.4 billion total population have already connected to the internet -- making the country the world's largest internet market and still leaving room for big connectivity growth. China already is the world's largest e-commerce market and overall retail market, and it's likely that an increasing share of the country's total consumer spending will take place online. JD's infrastructure network boasts approximately 600 warehouses, 7,000 delivery stations, and a massive fleet of delivery vehicles -- including drones and delivery robots. The company has the opportunity to improve margins as it automates more steps in its supply chain and leverages its distribution advantages to provide more-efficient services to a wider range of third-party businesses. The e-commerce company's shares trade at roughly 35 times this year's expected earnings, which might look too rich for some investors given that the trade situation has yet to be definitively resolved and Chinese economic growth has recently been slowing. But JD's forward P/E value is relatively low compared with levels in recent years, and the company's current valuation leaves plenty of room for growth as China's online retail market continues to develop over the next decade and beyond.  data by Having access to valuable data and the ability to sort through it and generate actionable insights will be one of the most important components to business success in the 21st century. That's especially true in technology ventures, but the importance of big data extends to nearly every major industry, and Elastic's collection of search and data management services have it positioned to play a key role in helping businesses manage and utilize their information. Elastic is an open-source software company that made its market debut last year, and its  and data services could see big demand increases that help power the stock to big returns. The company makes its core software available at no charge, which might initially sound like a confusing decision, but it's an approach that has allowed the business to rapidly build an enterprise user base and then sell additional services that augment its core offerings. This model allows the service to easily land new enterprise users, and Elastic can then sell a range of expansion services including machine learning applications, advanced analytics, and support services. The business already counts large enterprises including , , , and  among its list of enterprise clients, and it managed to increase its customer count to more than 8,800 at the end of its July quarter -- up roughly 60% year over year. The company is also having success in bridging users to expanded use of its services across its software suite. Elastic reported a net expansion rate greater than 130% in the last quarter, meaning that existing customers increased their spending with Elastic by more than 30% on average over the trailing 12 month period. These trends helped the company to grow currency-adjusted sales 62% year over year in the first quarter and roughly 70% in the last fiscal year.Elastic had its initial public offering in October 2018, pricing its stock at $36 per share and seeing its share price nearly double in the first daily session.

ll hasn't been rosy for chipmaker  this year. Sales are being pressured by the U.S.-China trade war, specifically the White House's trade restriction on sales to China's telecom giant Huawei, and the global economy has tapped the brakes. As a result, the company's year-over-year sales notched another slowdown during its fiscal 2020 second quarter (three months ended Sept. 28, 2019).Nevertheless, sales were still up 12% from a year ago, and Xilinx's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and other hardware and software platforms are still gaining in adoption. The going is tough at the moment, which is usually the time to start eyeing companies with a winning track record.Q2 sales came in at $833 million, near the upper end of guidance provided a few months ago. Paired with the , Xilinx is still putting up double-digit gains on the top and bottom lines. It may be a slowdown from the north-of-20% growth in the recent past, but it's still more than respectable given the  many businesses are taking at the moment.  Data source: Xilinx. Pp = percentage point.  What's behind this chipmaker's unlikely advance despite adversity? Multiple industries continue to warm up to field-programmable gate array (FPGA) computer chips and the flexibility they provide versus other chip types. The data center industry, automotive, and telecom specifically have been pushing revenues higher. Data center buildout has been slow this year but is expected to pick up again in 2020, as is the automotive industry, where Xilinx CEO Victor Peng said advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) are utilizing his company's flexible components. As for telecom, that has been a particular sore spot for reasons we'll address in a moment, but ongoing 4G mobile network enhancements and the early launch of 5G are still increasing demand for FPGAs as well. Over the summer, a new unified software platform to help accelerate cloud and edge computing development, called Vitis, was also launched. Xilinx believes its work in this area, as well as ongoing (and rising) demand for new computing needs, will foster further FPGA adoption in the years ahead.  Image source: Xilinx.All isn't perfect, though, and some of that can be blamed on the sales ban on Huawei. Xilinx had previously said about 6% to 8% of total revenues during the current fiscal year would come from the Chinese tech and telecom titan, but Peng said the management team has reduced its outlook on revenues from Huawei going forward down to zero as new trade licenses from federal regulators still haven't come through.That is putting pressure on the company's 5G network expectations in the short run, at least until a resolution is reached. Huawei plays in other markets outside of telecom as well, so there's going to be some pain from losing such a significant customer. The good news? Huawei isn't the only Chinese client, so there are other ways for Xilinx to participate in  if the ban lasts a long time.Another side point, not addressed during this trade-war focused , was chip designer 's announcement earlier in the week that it is also . The company thinks its graphics processing units are particularly well suited to helping 5G-based computing reach its full potential, powering technology like artificial intelligence and industrial robotics. Xilinx could thus find itself with some serious competition for its FPGAs.It all adds up to a disappointing short-term outlook. For Q3, management said to expect sales of $710 million to $740 million -- as much as an 11% year-over-year decline. Full-fiscal-year 2020 sales were forecasted to be $3.21 billion to $3.28 billion, representing at least a 5% increase over 2019 and sharply lower than the pace set so far this year. However, it is worth noting that management could be playing it safe with its estimates, and positive development with the Huawei situation could help lift current expectations. Either way, though, the longer-term outlook remains positive. Xilinx's advanced products category was up 29% during Q2 and now makes up 74% of total sales -- with automotive and data center end markets leading the charge. Though headwinds remain, this chipmaker still holds a lot of promise. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the ProShares ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF (Symbol: TQQQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $68.70 per unit.


With TQQQ trading at a recent price near $61.42 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.86% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of TQQQ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Amazon.com Inc (Symbol: AMZN), Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY), and Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX). Although AMZN has traded at a recent price of $1739.65/share, the average analyst target is 31.19% higher at $2282.24/share. Similarly, WDAY has 24.33% upside from the recent share price of $173.88 if the average analyst target price of $216.19/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting XLNX to reach a target price of $114.77/share, which is 21.78% above the recent price of $94.24. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of AMZN, WDAY, and XLNX:  

   Combined, AMZN, WDAY, and XLNX represent 9.05% of the ProShares ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"Last year,  (NASDAQ:) stock was the chip champ. It managed to be up 50% while the whole market was in correction. Today we examine the opportunity that fear is offering us this week.
Source: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.com
	As if we needed a reminder that stock markets are still hostage to headlines, yesterday a very weak  triggered heavy selling on Wall Street that flipped the day from very green to very red. Fear spiked 20%. Clearly, investors are on edge so for the short-term, homework is hampered a bit by headlines. But therein lies the opportunity to bet on AMD stock on these tough days.Not every dip is an absolute buy, but the longer AMD stock price lingers above support in spite of all these fears, the greater the upside rally will be. Timing is important because investor time frames vary a lot. There is no one-trade-fits-all here.For the long term, if stocks are higher then AMD stock will also be higher. This is a company that has great management and it operates inside a popular sector. The world is addicted to technology and this is not a fad. The tech trend will linger for decades and increase exponentially. Demand on AMD products and services will be strong for years to come. There is enough room for it,  (NASDAQ:), and  (NASDAQ:) to thrive. This is to say that long-term investors in AMD need not worry about these shorter term gyrations.For the short term, the charts offer a great map for the active traders. First thing to note is that on Tuesday when markets were falling out of bed, AMD held up fairly well. This often suggests that there isn’t much froth left in the stock here. But this is not the same as saying that it is cheap.AMD stock is not a bargain since it sells at a three digit price-to-earnings ratio. However, it’s only at 5 times sales so it’s not bloated either. This could be that they are growing their sales lines so they can keep up this over-valuation for a while longer. For comparison, INTC has a 12 P/E but 3.5 times sales and NVDA sells at 9 times sales plus an outrageous P/E.What is important is that AMD grew their sales 60% in three years. Growth companies like these are supposed to spend a lot in order to deliver on expectations. But there is often a reason why investors give stocks like AMD more leeway than others.Year-to-date it is leading the pack of the sector by at least 20%. Over two years, AMD stock is up 122% when INTC and NVDA are +27% and -4% respectively. This is a case where you get what you pay for.It is unfortunate that the sector trades in unison, because they recently suffered in sympathy from the earnings selloff in  (NYSE:). This is where Wall Street extrapolates from one company’s shortcomings into all others in the same sector regardless.The AMD chart shows that price has fallen into support from the consolidation zone during April through June, so it is imperative that it holds. Otherwise, the AMD stock price is vulnerable to trigger bearish patterns that would target $25 per share. This is not a forecast but a scenario that exists today. But if we get economic reports that contradict the woes that the manufacturing ISM showed this week then this tizzy shall pass and AMD will recover and seek new highs.The central banks are still committed to inflating the globe. The U.S. service sector and consumer are still alive and strong, so the bullish thesis still makes sense. Plus we are going into an election period so it is likely that politicians will want to keep things rosy in the U.S. until then, As a result, they will do whatever it takes to maintain U.S. GDP on track. All this is to say that the headlines have not yet changed the game. But they do offer opportunity dips.Conversely, there is no denying that uncertainty reigns this week so I don’t take full positions at once. Furthermore, it is prudent to use tight stops so not to turn trades into long-term commitments. It is important to define the investment’s time profile and stick to it.It also curious that most analysts who cover the stock have it as a hold. This reduces the risk of downgrades and increases upside surprises. Their median price target is 13% higher than current prices so there is plenty of room to run.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q2 2020 , Good afternoon. My name is Sheryl, and I'll be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and a business outlook for the December quarter and full year fiscal 2020.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents that the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.In addition to GAAP financial measures, we will be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions.We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website.This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thanks Matt, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report our results for the second quarter fiscal 2020 and provide an update on our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. For Q2, we achieved sales of $833 million, which exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance despite the impact of continuing trade restrictions with Huawei. DCG business bounce back as expected and had a very strong quarter with record revenue of $81 million, which represented 92% sequential and 24% year-over-year growth. This result was primarily driven by growth in sales to storage customers with some additional hyperscale customer demand and limited growth from cryptocurrency customers.In our core vertical markets, ABC revenues were in line with expectations while AIT revenues were better than expected. WWG revenues were weaker than anticipated due to minimal sales of permissible products to Huawei. While we expedited our application process to the Department of Commerce in early Q2, we have not received any license approvals to expand the product set permissible to sell to Huawei. Through the first half of fiscal 2020, we recognized revenue of approximately $50 million from Huawei, with the vast majority of that coming -- that total coming in Q1, before restrictions were announced.Multiple research analysts had estimated our full-year revenue exposure to Huawei approximately 6% to 8% of our total revenue, which is in the range of what we are anticipating at the beginning of the fiscal year. Considering the continued trade restrictions with Huawei and the uncertainty presented to our business, we believe it is prudent to remove all remaining revenue expectations related to Huawei from our fiscal 2020 outlook. Huawei is an important customer, and we hope that an agreement between the US and Chinese governments is reached as soon as possible, so we can resume engaging in a manner consistent with an important customer.Now I'll turn to some additional highlights for the second quarter. Revenue from our advanced products grew 29% year-over-year and represented approximately 74% of total sales. We saw broad-based demand for our 16 nanometer UltraScale Plus family, which continues to be a strong revenue driver for our business. Demand for our Zynq platform also continues to be strong, driven by the adoption of MPSoC in wireless applications as well as across our core vertical markets, particularly in our auto business. Our RFSoC is also deployed with multiple wireless customers and is being evaluated by many customers in other end markets. Overall revenue for our Zynq family grew 61% year-over-year, which represented approximately 26% of total revenue in Q2.Customer feedback related to our Zynq family has been remarkable and gives us significant confidence in our transformation to a platform company. We hosted over 1300 attendees at our Xilinx Developer Forum in San Jose earlier this month. At this sold-out event we announced a breakthrough and a new unified open source software platform called Vitis. We expect that over time Vitis will drive significantly more Xilinx platform engagements with software developers and data scientists. We continue to make good progress building out our global ecosystem of partners, customers, developers and applications, which now has reached nearly 7,000 developers over 750 ISVs and includes more than 90 applications now in production.We announced the engagement with Microsoft Azure, which further demonstrates the breadth of hyperscale/hyperscaler relationships, which include Amazon, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and Tencent. Microsoft announced that it will be deploying Alveo U250 accelerator cards in its Azure cloud. Amazon announced that it has expanded is EC2 F1 instances, and additionally, they are adapting Sagemaker Neo to run on Xilinx technology. Samsung shared a collaboration on leveraging Versa ACAP to enable their next generation of 5G solutions. We also saw many key ecosystem partners demonstrate examples of FPGAs in use for workload acceleration in the data center with increased presence of SmartSST's and SmartNICs.Considering a challenging business environment, I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make with our strategy and platform transformation.I'll pause here and hand the call over to Lorenzo to walk you through the financials for the fiscal second quarter. -- Thank you, Victor. Before I go into the results, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you with whom I have had the pleasure of working with over the last decade. I sincerely wish all of you, and of course the great team here at Xilinx, all the best in the future. Now on to the fiscal second quarter results. Overall, our business performed well this quarter and we were able to exceed the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Total revenue was in line with guidance at $833 million, up 12% year-over-year, but down 2% sequentially. Wired and wireless group grew revenue 24% year-over-year but declined 8% quarter-over-quarter. Quarter-to-quarter wireless was flat as our diverse customer base showed strength despite the Huawei shipping restrictions.Wired business declined significantly quarter-to-quarter due to Huawei and softness from other customers. Note, we had one communications customer that represented approximately 12% of the quarterly revenue in Q2. Revenue from the Data Center Group increased 24% year-over-year and 92% quarter-over-quarter. We saw better-than-expected strength from one of our storage customers. We also had growth in multiple hyperscalers and broader accounts, despite the Huawei ban.Finally, we had approximately $5 million in revenue from Solarflare this quarter. AIT grew 7% year-over-year but declined 9% quarter-on-quarter. Year-over-year we saw significant strength in A&D and flatness in industrial. TME did decline significantly. This was as expected and is due to a specific customer program we have highlighted previously. Quarter-on-quarter, our decline was primarily due to TME and industrial, partially offset by the strength in A&D. In ABC, we continue our strong long-term growth trend with 9% growth year-over-year. Quarter-to-quarter, we grew 6%. Both year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by double-digit growth in our auto business. Broadcast also grew both on a quarterly and year-over-year basis, although consumer was down sequentially and year-over-year. Gross margin was lower than expectations with GAAP gross margin of 65% and non-GAAP gross margin of 66%. Gross margin was impacted by product and customer mix in AIT and customer mix in DCG. As a reminder, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is due to M&A related amortization.GAAP opex at $337 million and non-GAAP opex at $331 million were both below expectations. Non-GAAP operating expense excluding Solarflare was $321 million, below our guide of $322 million. Solarflare which closed on July 31, contributed around $10 million to opex in Q2. GAAP operating income was $204 million, or 24% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $217 million, or 26% operating margin. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately negative 5%. We had expected a low rate this quarter due to the tax accounting rules for share-based compensation. GAAP net income was $227 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.89. GAAP EPS grew 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $240 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.94 a share, yielding an 80% growth over last year. Diluted share count decreased to 255 million shares.Next, I'll cover a few key points on the balance sheet and cash flow. Gross cash was $2.5 billion with $1.2 billion in long-term debt. Accounts receivable increased to $335 million and is at 37 days, still within our normal operating range. Overall, we generated $224 million in operating cash flow. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at an average price of $103.60 per share, and paid dividends of $93 million. Finally, the Board of Directors of Xilinx have approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. Note that we aren't providing details on the timing and exact number of common shares to be purchased, as that will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors.Now let me turn the call back to Victor for comments regarding the business outlook. Victor? -- Thanks Lorenzo. And let me take this opportunity to express to you on behalf of the company and personally our appreciation and gratitude for all your contributions and accomplishments over the last decade at Xilinix. Thank you so much, Lorenzo. -- Thank you, Victor. -- And now turning to our outlook. For fiscal Q3, we expect revenue between 710 million and 740 million, which is a decrease of 9% year-on-year and 13% sequentially. This drop is due to several headwinds that coincide in the quarter that I'll explain. That said, we're expecting Q3 to be a bottom with strong rebound in Q4. For DCG, revenue is expected to be slightly down in Q3 with more meaningful growth resuming in the fourth quarter. We are seeing a pause in hyperscale customer orders in Q3, but expect growth to resume in Q4 as customer POC transitions to production.We also expect continuing contributions from storage and networking customers, including those from Solarflare. We expect crypto contribution to moderate over time from the low-teens of millions of single-digit millions that we move into Q4. For WWG, we expect revenues to be meaningfully lower in both the third and fourth quarters. This is principally due to the removal of revenue expectations from Huawei in addition to the expected transition to ASICs for select baseband products previously discussed. We expect our revenue from our wired business to recover somewhat in the fourth quarter, while wireless remains weak.Lastly, we are seeing global trade uncertainty causing some customers to exercise caution in ordering, as well as some slower than expected customer ramps. For our core vertical markets revenue is expected to be flat in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter. Q3 revenue will be lower than prior expectations primarily due to macroeconomic related headwinds. The increasing growth in Q4 is expected to come from a broad base of customers, including TME, aerospace and defense, automotive and industrial customers. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 67% to 69%, which is a return to our historical range with a less wireless heavy product mix. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be approximately $33 million. Non-GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $1 million, and our tax rate is expected to be between 4% to 6%.Now turning to FY 20 outlook, we expect total revenue to be between 3.21 billion and 3.28 billion. We expect the second half of FY 20 to be down relative to the first half of the year, with an expectation of for strong sequential growth in fiscal Q4 following the bottom in fiscal Q3. This represents approximately 6% year-over-year growth following a record FY19. This performance is a testament to the durability of a model given that we haven't been able to ship fully to an important customer since mid-Q1 and the current global trade uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds.We expect in FY 2019 non-GAAP gross margin range between 66.5% to 68.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 1.3 billion for the year. This is approximately 50 million lower than prior expectations at Analyst Day, and reflects the active expense management that we put in place for the second half of the year given the current business conditions. Note that when normalizing for the incremental expense of recent acquisitions, our operating expense is now expected to be approximately $80 million lower than our expectations at the start of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $25 million, our tax rate is expected to be between 4% to 5%.Now I'll take a few minutes to provide some additional color on business units and core vertical markets as we head into the back half of the year. For DCG we expect FY 20 revenues to grow approximately 30% to FY 19 revenue. We have continued to build out our capabilities as we address a dynamic data center market that has continued to evolve as customers are evaluating the use of FPGAs for compute, network, and storage acceleration. Despite a slower start in the first half of the year and learning the impact of Huawei trade restrictions, we are expecting stronger growth in the second half that builds on the progress we made with other hyperscale customers both in the US and in China.Now in compute, we continue to expand our FaaS platform with all the key Hyperscale customers. We have built deep engagements with both enterprise and hyperscalers to bring real-time video streaming and database acceleration programs to production. Now, in some cases the qualification time needed to reach production deployments is taking longer than expected. This has moderated the revenue growth rate we had anticipated at the start of FY 20. These expanded timelines weren't in our original model, but we have now factored that into our outlook going forward. With the launch of Vitis, we expect that over time customers will be able to develop and deploy our boards into production more rapidly.In storage, we expect the computational storage and SmartSSD market to continue to be a significant growth driver, with key customers including Micron and Samsung. At the Flash Memory Summit in August, we showcased 14 separate partners with computational storage platforms each using Xilinx products. In networking, we have meaningfully integrated our Solarflare team and we have strong engineering engagements with multiple hyperscalers. We believe we are well -positioned to compete in the early stages of a growing SmartNIC market. Last thing on DCG, we expect revenue volatility to abate over time as the diversity of our customer base increases and our revenue reaches a higher run rate.Now for WWG, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year will relative to FY19, including the impact of the Huawei trade restrictions. Without the Huawei impact, our WWG business has performed roughly in-line with the expectations we shared at Analyst Day in May. Our first half wireless revenue benefit from early 5G deployments, mainly in South Korea and China, and a modest amount in other markets. Our second half is more challenging given the expected based on ASIC transition and unexpected program delays with some communication customers. That said, this ASIC transition will be largely completed in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that we are just at the beginning of the Global 5G rollout, which remains a significant opportunity for Xilinx over the coming years, but will continue to be somewhat lumpy. Going forward, given our market leadership position versus the competition, and our capabilities in RF design, we are well-positioned to grow our wireless business as intended density increases in the write-out head with new 5G deployments.For our core vertical markets, we now expect FY20 revenue to grow high single digits year-over-year. While revenue in the first half of FY 20 grew close to our expectations, we are seeing macroeconomic related headwinds impacting customer demand in both AIT and ABC markets in Q3. Additionally, we are expecting revenue from a planned program ramp at a key emulation and prototyping customer, but that will extend over somewhat longer period beyond FY20 and into FY20. However, we expect strong customer demand from a broad range of customers TME, ISM, A&D and auto coming in Q4. We also expect modest growth in distribution channel demand in Q4 in anticipation of some growth in our broad markets heading into FY 21.So in closing, we are executing the strategy we outlined at our Analyst Day in May, as we believe it's the right long-term path for Xilinx despite some near-term headwinds. Xilinx remains well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends that will continue to driving our business for years to come. We will continue to invest in growth aligned with our strategy, but we're actively moderating our R&D and overall operating expenses, given the current business environment.We will now open the call for questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hi, thank you. I just wanted to stick with the full-year fiscal year guidance. Victor, what gives you the confidence -- this is pretty large Q-over-Q embedded in the 6% growth. So, and notoriously turns requirements are higher for the business. So sitting here, how can you -- what gives you the confidence on that growth for the fourth quarter? -- Yeah, I think from a sequential perspective Q3, as I said in my prepared remarks that had a coincidence of a bunch of headwinds occurring sort of at the same time, right? Some of which as, as we said, we expected, some of which were not expected. So I would say one thing is just the contract of that, but we do have strong confidence in Q4 because it is broad across a number of things including some strong wins that we have, that we are tracking very closely and clearly are going to move as expected, right? So I mean, obviously, I think it's really a contrast of the Q3 to the Q4, but we feel we have good visibility in the Q4.Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra of Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hi. What are you seeing in terms of the base station build activity in China given the US ban? Is that still ongoing or has that changed significantly in the quarter? And where do you see meaningful diversification with shipments in base station outside of Huawei? -- So you know, from what we see that we do think that they are approximately on the path of the base stations deployment they said they were initially going to do in China. Clearly, the Huawei has significant impact, but they're not our only customer in China. So we are still participating in China deployment, clearly though Huawei has a big impact. I think there are some second order things too, but I think it's probably simple to say is that overall I think it sounds like the first point is about on track, but we are participating, but not with one of the top players. -- Great, thank you.Your next question is from Chris Danely of Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hey guys, just a question on taking Huawai to zero. It seems like most of the other SME companies have kind of restored anywhere from 2/3 to 3/4 of their shipments to them. Can you just elaborate on why you're not doing that versus, it seems like most of their SMEs have already started to reship? -- Again, I can't really speak to how other customers justify how they believe they can ship. We obviously have been tracking this extremely carefully with our internal and external counsel, we talked to Department of Commerce. We applied, as I said in our prepared remarks, our licenses. None of those have come through. I guess one thing I would say is that, many people supply Huawei because they have a very diversified business, 5G being explicitly cited as a security issue. There could be differences there. But all I can say is that we're following all the rules and regulations. But we're carefully monitoring this and we put in licenses, and we just haven't had anything approved yet. -- Okay, thanks for the color.Your next question is from Chris Caso of Raymond James. Please go ahead your line is open. -- Yes, thank you. Just a little bit of color on what's going on with the DCG. And I guess with the lowered guidance as compared to the Analyst Day, maybe you can break out what's changing and thinking how much of that was attributed to Huawei, because I believe that was a customer in DCG. And how much of it is just customers being a little bit slower to adopt solutions , or perhaps this is indicative of the economic environment as well? Thanks. -- So actually, you did a fairly good job hitting some of the points. I mean, I -- in complete candor, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing great traction. The opportunity is still continuing to be really great, but we have learned that in some cases, getting to that production from proof of concepts, what I refer to as POCs, and also just qualification of some of them, that is taking a bit longer than we expected, and just we hadn't anticipated. But as I said, we have now folded that into our go-forward. So that's one thing.The other thing as you hit it exactly right. Huawei did have an FPGA as a Service, FaaS program, and we had to stop that. We're still working through things around that, but that had an impact. And then I would say that there was, as we expressed, some digestion, some pullback.Having said all of that, in our second half is quite a bit stronger than our first and 30% growth is our estimate. If we come in midpoint to our guide, it's a strong guide. It's an emerging market. We clearly feel good about this a long-term opportunity being over $1 billion. But sometimes in the emerging market, it's a little challenging to get the timing exactly right. But yeah, that's -- those are the points, to the degree you kind of hit on them. -- Okay, thank you.Your next question comes from C. J. Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Yeah, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess one of the key questions out there is the ability for your wireless business to grow into fiscal '21. So I guess now that you've pulled Huawei 100% out of the numbers and you're guiding WWG flat, what are the core assumptions that we need to kind of assume into fiscal '21 to have the confidence on that growth? Both in terms of I guess ASIC replacement on the base band processor as well as rising content and free cash flow sides. Thank you.Yeah, C. J. so let me say that first of all, just to reiterate what you said is that we -- for the remainder FY 20, I think we've de-risked everything that we're aware of. Right. I don't want to give any specifics for FY 21, but just the broader picture, our view has not changed from the Analyst Days. 5G is definitely going to be a bigger deployment overall. It's a bigger opportunity for us, because we're not just doing the same old thing. We're innovating, delivering more value to our customers with things like our RFSoC, with things like Versal. So we still feel good about that. Obviously, the big variance from that day in Analyst Day has been the whole trade situation.But I guess what I would say is that we're still in early -- early innings on deployment. So as other innings come through, and as some of the things, the trials and things we will see go into production and we get wins in Versal and so forth. And even the wins we have in MPSoC, we still think this is a strong opportunity. And of course, we will give you FY 21 in the usual time frame, right after this fiscal year. -- Great, thank you.Your next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hi guys, thanks for all the color on segments in the fiscal year, and Lorenzo best of luck with your next move. So Victor, I wanted to ask a question on the core vertical market side of things. It doesn't get as much attention, but it's still part of your business obviously. Overall, I just wanted to see what gives you the confidence in the flat -- in the fiscal third quarter outlook sequentially, and then up in fiscal fourth quarter and we can contrast that against TI last night, who I think surprised of the vast majority of us with the weakness that they alluded to at least in the December quarter. So what gives you the confidence in being so much better than that broad based guy or broad based peers in general for both of those quarters? -- Yeah, I guess again, I really can't speak for others. I guess what I would say is that we do -- we do see softness in macroeconomic-related, and some of that is probably also somewhat related to the whole trade situation we kind of expressed. I think we expressed even in Q1 that we have a -- we called it, I think I referred to it as a product transition with a key TME customer. Giving a little more color, that ramp is happening, but it's going to happen a little bit more spread out. So that's an example at the Analyst Day and prototyping of one instance, our channel definitely has softened, especially in Europe, also in Asia, and on a little pause.But on the other hand, like let's take auto for instance. ADAS is where we play as you know, and even though near-term auto units are down, what we're hearing is from a different signal that in calendar 2020 that is going to strengthen. So we see that, and we still have already shipping units that will just continue to ramp in ADAS as well as being designed into fully autonomous driving. So I guess what it is, is the confidence that we actually see the dip in Q3, but we are seeing from multiple markets, so it's kind of broad. I won't say that it's just one market, it is broad that we're seeing it coming back in Q4. And so, and then a few key things where we are very confident, just because of we know those programs very, very well. -- Thank you. -- Welcome.Your next question comes from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thank you very much, good afternoon. Victor, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the the guide for the December quarter. Just a couple of moving parts, I know you guys I think called out in the commentary $50 million to Huawei in the first half of the year. I would assume that most of that was during the first quarter. So if we could understand a little bit about the sequential difference between Q2 and the Q3 guide there?and similar for the Solarflare revenue coming into the model. I guess, this will be a full quarter in December. Just trying to understand those moving parts, thanks. -- Yes. I know this is a pretty packed prepared statements because we did want to give a lot of color. So just to reiterate, yes, you're exactly spot-on. With Huawei, the 50 million was predominantly in Q1, prior to the restrictions going in place. Last quarter, we had determined that even with the restrictions there some older products that we could legally continue to ship. It turns out that revenue was very essentially negligible, which is why after one quarter of seeing that and not seeing any additional license approvals, we have decided that it's just prudent to take all the risk out for the remainder of the fiscal year. With regards to Solarflare that closed -- that only closed in July. So you're right, it's only the first full quarter of revenue in the December quarter. And it's what we expect, on the order of 10 million-ish. But we did the acquisition from a strategic perspective of they really bring the software and drive expertise in overall system expertise complementing our strength and silicon in the hardware, and so we are feeling very good about the integration in the engagements we have. And from that the revenue is also what we expect. But I think really more important, the strategic pieces, now that they're part of us, we feel even better about. -- Yeah, Matt, it's I just point out one thing is we plan to consolidate obviously those results and not break those out in future calls. But that just gives you a sense what Victor's comments around what we expect primarily going forward from now.Your next question comes from the line of David Wong of Instinet. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thanks very much. Can you clarify what you have applied for licenses for? Does this cover all of the revenues that you were previously shipping to Huawei? Or, if not, approximately what percent of prior revenues to Huawei do your current license applications cover? -- Yeah, it's actually very detailed, I wouldn't want to give you -- I don't think it's appropriate to try to break down exactly. I would say it would be -- if what we had applied for in early July all got approved, it will be meaningful. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't necessarily say the entirety, but it would be meaningful. And clearly if that happened, we would continue to try and seek licenses, but unfortunately, like nothing has been approved. And as I said, the small set of mostly older products, it hasn't managed any kind of meaningful revenue. So we've just decided to de-risk it. -- Great, thanks. -- You're welcome.Your next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Great, thank you. You said that the baseband to ASIC transitional impact is kind of, winds down by the fourth quarter of your fiscal year. Is that, can you give us a sense for the wireless business that remains? How much baseband is still in there from from other customers, any transitional risk? And just I assume that the radio deployments are sort of starting to ramp up as we move beyond those, is that a fair way to look at it? -- Yeah, I mean, we still have meaningful wireless business. But yes, the baseband ASICs which we had said even on Analyst Day that we expect that was going to happen, that has happened. We do still have some position, but I don't think it's very significant at this point in baseband. I think we've always said that even ASIC replacement, as you know Joe, is not -- not new to us. We've always said that our opportunity is bigger in the radio, but even in the future that we expect some degree of a baseband revenue. But we had an outsized amount earlier, and I think we were upfront about that. But again, I would sort of say that you know we -- it is significant that it would be radio. But we still do baseband connectivity. Again, that's historically been the thing, we were in the heart of the overall baseband and the start of this early deployment. -- Okay, got it. Thank you very much.Your next question is from William Stein of SunTrust. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Great, thanks for taking my question. If we get some resolution to the tariff situation, but we still have a ban on Huawei going forward, Victor, I wonder if you could comment on expectation for relative to the longer-term growth you outlined at the Analyst Day, not what's it going to do next year? But you talked about the seeing growth of I think 35% in DCG and I think 16% in wired and wireless. Are those still realistic as share would shift to other customers of yours? Or do you think it would call those growth estimates in question? -- Well, first of all, regarding tariffs, every time those things have occurred we've analyzed those things and the tariffs don't directly impact us in any way. There could be like secondary, tertiary things, just being a dampener on macroeconomics, but it doesn't impact us in a direct way. So if there were some relief there, but if the restrictions on Huawei stayed intact for a prolonged period of time that would be the bigger thing than tariffs, by far. That, which is why I think I've been consistent in saying that we really hope that the governments can come to agreement and resolve the structural issues so we can continue to gauge with Huawei.That said, we're still just again, I want to say that we're still participating in the China 5G, but clearly they are very big player there. And I don't want to speculate on what happens in a long-term rate. It's just -- it's just too difficult, and we certainly look at different scenarios internally, so we're prepared for things. But it's really clearly premature to speculate beyond FY 20. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hey, Victor, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on where you saw the weakness in the wired business and what drives the recoveries we get into the fourth quarter? Is the weakness mostly the Huawei effect or is it broader than just that one customer? -- Well, it's that was definitely an impact because people tend to think of Huawei as just purely Huawei, but actually play in both places. And so they're, they're pretty substantial there. But it's not just the one customer. I think there has been some bonus in access in cable. I think that there is a particular situation where things, people initially started to deploy then they took a more cautious approach, because of course with 5G it's both wireless and then ultimately the wired network has to be upgraded as well, and I think with all this uncertainty there has been, as I said in my prepared remarks, some caution around that. So Huawei is definitely big deal, but it is not the only thing.Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I'm struggling a little bit with the March -- implied March guidance, obviously if WWG is down, it suggests substantial growth in the two other segments to get anywhere near the sequential, and it will be record revenue across the board for all those segments. So I think I'm doing the math right, I guess I'm just trying to understand in this environment why you would be doing record revenue with this substantial double-digit increases into March? -- Well, data center as I said, you know, if we hit the midpoint in our guide, it will be about 30% year-on-year increase. And obviously the first half is a little softer. So DCG is definitely robustly growing in the second half, right? I mean, Q2 was a record, so Q3 is coming off of that a little bit, but that was a record. But then we said that we've resume sequential strength in DCG in Q4. So overall, Q4 our DCG is growing very strong, and yeah, it will be a record. In some of the other markets, I think you know we -- I think we had said that TME had earlier because of some product transitions, that that was slowing down. And also earlier semis was a little weak, so in terms of semiconductor tests it was a variety of different things, but we had already expected that in the second half things would strengthen. It's still going to strengthen, maybe a little more moderated than we had expected back in the spring for sure, because of some of the macro, and some of the other issues, but that's still happening. And as we said, auto, people are starting to see ADAS is still growing, auto is still going to pick up. It will be double-digit.So it's actually in Q4 kind of broad, Q3 is just, it really is kind of a perfect storm of a bunch of things some expected, some unexpected, happening all at once. So you have this big contrast there but, yeah, that's that's how we see it right now. -- Great, thank you.Your next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my question, and thank you and good luck to Lorenzo on his next adventure. -- Thank you, Vivek. -- Victor, could you -- thank you. Maybe, Victor if you could help us differentiate your position in the radio side. I think you mentioned that you expect to have fairly resilient business in the radio side. What is unique to an FPGA in the radio that cannot be done within ASIC? I assume that some of your customers already use some ASICs in the radio side in China and other places, so why -- what gives you the confidence that they cannot be ASIC replacement on the radio side, at some point? -- Well, again, first of all, what I would say is, if you look at our MPSoC and absolutely our RFSoC, those aren't just pure FPGAs, right? So I will -- I really want to go back to those have multi-core SoCs in them, they have a lot -- a number of other features that are hardened and yet still flexible and programmable. And of course the RFSoC has integrated RF quality ADCs in decks. There are no products in the marketplace, even today after we've released this for quite some time out there. So what we could do is, we could be used in different geographies, support different standards with the same piece of silicon. Obviously, we get people to market very rapidly.There's just authorizations, particularly and the trend to [Indecipherable] and where things as virtualization, that's the disruption and an opportunity and we definitely see that in the long-range that's a big thing. Then I would say is -- as we announced, ACAP a year ago, and now we've delivered silicon and we're shipping that. We have development boards. That's, way not an FPGA. That's a whole new class of product and absolutely that's -- I've said that we feel like we have an even stronger position versus fixed architectures. And if you have heard about XDF in my prepared comments, Samsung was on the stage, talking about how we're collaborating looking at how ACAP can intercept their 5G roadmap. -- Thank you. -- You're welcome.Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Your line is open. -- Hey, Victor. So for WWG, where do you see your biggest opportunity in the next 18 months coming from? Is it really the European guys at this point? And then I think you also mentioned some customer delays. So any thoughts on timing of resolution and relaunching those products? Thanks. -- Yeah, I mean 18 months is pretty far out. I sort of feel that that's not something we can give guidance on at this point in time. We clearly have diverse everything that we've seen for the remainder of this fiscal year. We are in the early stages of deployment. So I would generalize your comments to say clearly there's going to be several generations, as well as geographical deployments. Right now it's South Korea and China a little bit in Japan, but not very meaningful. So clearly there will be other geographies that deploy and there'll be multiple generations of 5G equipment. So we're engaged with all the OEMs worldwide, not just Samsung and Chinese OEMs, but also the European. So we're engaged in all of them. And so, yes, as these things deploy, we still feel, again, from a strategic perspective that opportunity is still great. Obviously, trade, we will have to see.Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open. -- Thank you for allowing me back in. Before I forget, I would be remiss if I didn't say thank you to Lorenzo and wish you all the best. It's a pleasure working with you. Thanks for all the transparency and help as this year for Xilinx. I had a question, I want to come back to the data center side, Victor, and maybe this should be a good times for us from our side to get a little bit recalibrated with how you think the longer-term opportunities are. So compute, network, and storage, and if you look out longer-term which of those three are going to be the big drivers to get to the long-term targets you have given? And I had a quick one on datacenters, but I think I heard you mention that one of the reasons gross margin was weaker was because of data center mix, did I hear that correct? Does that imply that data center will be diluted to gross margin? Thank you. -- Okay. So yeah I'll take the first part and then Lorenzo will work at the remainder of this call here. Yeah, look at the first part, I think all three sub-segments are going to be meaningful drivers. I mean, they are obviously different in nature. I mean, overall in the very long run, compute is still the largest segment, it's also in some respects. It is a long game because that's the place where we really we announced Vitis, we announced open source, where we're doing a lot of things to sort of give users that traditionally have not use our platform feel comfortable. Our work in their own environment like the artificial intelligence, machine learning frameworks like tends to flow and so forth. So that in the long run is the biggest opportunity, but it's also going to take time, because that's where ecosystem and all those tools and so on so forth this can play a big role.But both smart as at the end SmartNIC whereas they may not be so large and along, there are also still quite meaningful and there we don't have those issues, right. We're engaged with multiple hyperscalers. We're also have some OEM engagements and we have -- we've been setting up our channels, bars, SIs and so forth and so we see some really good opportunities there. So again, it depends on your time frame, which is going to be big contributors. We see contributions from all of them quite frankly, and yeah, we're really excited, but in full. We've learned that it takes some time to get these POC is done, it takes some time to get all the requirements. But now that we have those learnings we're still going -- we're going to go after robustly. -- And so on the margin piece, I think, I'll start with the end of your question which is, do you expect growth in data center over long term negative impact on our gross margin. I think the dynamic with data center over the long term will be similar to some of our other larger segments where we have large customers with relatively lower margins as would be expected and broad set of customers with relatively higher margins and the overall impact on the mix as we expected today is relatively neutral and close to our corporate average. In the short term the exact office of things happening, where we had customer concentration and which is actually a good thing in this case, because it showed very strong customer growth and it wasn't that the net result was significantly off of corporate gross margin, it was just, there was a lower than our expectations. So that's why it pulled us down versus our forecast. -- So maybe because of storage being a bigger driver, that led to lower gross margin? -- That's a good hypothesis. -- Thank you. -- Operator. I think we have time for one more.There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Matt Poirier for closing remarks. -- Great.

all is in full swing, and the stock market is abuzz with traders testing their strategies. Concerns about economic and political dynamics have been dominating discussions, but other indicators have given continued legs to bullish sentiment. The  index has risen roughly 16.5% on the year, but dipped roughly 2% over the last few months. With 2019's final quarter kicking off on a somewhat volatile note, it's a good time to focus on companies that are already delivering consistent profits and returning cash to shareholders. Thankfully, that still leaves plenty of flexibility, and it doesn't have to mean completely giving up on growth.  ,  , and   operate in three very different sectors and have different risk, dividend, and growth profiles. But each looks like a worthwhile portfolio addition for investors pursuing diversified income strategies this month. Image source: Getty Images.With a  of roughly 1.6%, Xilinx might not have much appeal for investors prioritizing big dividend payments in the near term. On the other hand, the semiconductor specialist has increased its payout each year since it began a regular quarterly dividend in 2004, and it looks like an appealing dividend growth play that could benefit from trends in cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver big returns. Xilinx built its position in the semiconductor space around chips it pioneered known as field programmable gate arrays. These programmable chips allow engineers to alter their functions. They have seen increasing adoption by telecom and networking companies as prices have come down, performance has improved, and increasingly complex communications technologies have required a greater degree of flexibility. Rising demand for the company's solutions is likely to continue despite some near-term, macro-related setbacks.The semiconductor market has seen volatility tied to unstable trade relations between the U.S. and China, with tariffs tamping down device sales and causing companies to reassess growth plans. The U.S. move to ban companies from dealing with Huawei is having immediate sales and earnings impacts for many tech companies, resulting in more cautious outlooks.These dynamics could continue to weigh on the space, and Xilinx in particular, for longer than some investors will be comfortable with. But the business has established leadership in its corner of the semiconductor market, and promising expansion into new AI-focused chip platforms could prove very lucrative.Xilinx shares have slid 30% over the last six months, and now trade at roughly 24 times this year's expected earnings. That might appear pricey at first, but the company looks like a worthwhile play for investors willing to take on risk in pursuit of payout growth and a long runway for capital appreciation. The chipmaker is poised to see long-term business tailwinds thanks to the rollout of 5G networks and the development and integration of AI technologies, and it stands out as an appealing dividend-growth candidate despite the trade challenges facing the broader chip space.Johnson & Johnson is the textbook definition of a blue chip stock, and it's trading at levels that leave room for long-term upside. Shares are priced at roughly 15 times this year's earnings, its dividend yield sits at roughly 2.9%, and the healthcare giant continues to look like a worthwhile  despite uncertainty stemming from a gamut of legal challenges.The defining narrative surrounding the company hasn't had much to do with fundamentals: J&J is facing thousands of lawsuits, and the cloud isn't going away overnight. Suits alleging that J&J's talcum-based powders were contaminated with asbestos or included fibrous talc that resulted in illnesses including ovarian cancer and mesothelioma have dominated the company's news cycles. Judgments against J&J in the talc cases have already totaled above $5 billion, thousands of other cases remain undecided, and it has pending litigation regarding other products. A Philadelphia court recently entered an $8 billion judgment against the company in a suit alleging that it failed to adequately warn that users of its drug Risperdal were at increased risk of developing gynecomastia. As with the talc judgments and a $527 million award in favor of the State of Oklahoma in a suit alleging that J&J misrepresented the benefits and risks of opioid-based products, the company is appealing the Risperdal ruling. With its diversified strength in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products, it should withstand and emerge from the current round of legal challenges, and it has big cash flow and safe payout ratios to keep substantial dividends coming in the meantime. J&J's move to raise its quarterly dividend 5.6% to $0.95 per share in April marked its 57th consecutive year of annual dividend growth, and investors can feel assured that the company will continue to hike its payout each year. Healthcare is relatively recession-proof, and over the long term, Johnson & Johnson will benefit from trends including an aging population in its domestic market and growth in international markets. Initiatives like AI integration in pharmaceuticals and moves into surgical robotics and augmented reality in medical devices are part of the company's push to create new treatments and services, so there's a good chance it can continue to be a healthcare leader. The legal issues will be on the table for a while, but J&J still looks worthwhile for income investors. Hanesbrands has slumped roughly 15% over the last year as sluggish performance for the socks and underwear segment and the rise of in-house private-label brands at large retailers like  have weighed on its outlook. Shares trade at less than 8.5 times this year's expected earnings, and yield roughly 4.1%. And while the business continues to have a relatively meager earnings growth outlook in the near term, the stock's weak performance has it trading at attractive levels. The company expects its adjusted earnings to grow just over 2% this year, but cash flow momentum is more encouraging, and the business has the opportunity to shift into delivering better per-share earnings growth as it implements additional cost-savings and drives expansion for high-performing products like its Champion clothing line. It expects operating cash flow to increase from $643 million last year to $750 million at the midpoint of its target for this year. For fiscal 2020, management expects to hit $900 million in operating cash flow -- or $1 billion with additional acquisitions. Hanesbrands has reasonable payout ratios, with the cost of covering its dividend coming in at roughly 40% of its trailing free cash flow. But investors should approach the stock without the expectation of a payout increase in the next couple of years. The dividend has been flat since 2017, and management has indicated that cash flow will be going toward paying down debt and share buybacks before the payout gets a hike. Nonetheless, it already offers a strong yield, and the stock has substantial rebound potential trading at such low multiples.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he technology sector has become a great place to look for , as the 3.2% average yield offered by companies in this sector is more than double the 's average dividend yield of 1.5%.What's more, dividend-paying technology companies offer investors the potential to benefit from fast-growing trends and the associated stock price upside. This is why we are going to take a closer look at   and   -- two stocks that are sitting on notable opportunities and trade at very attractive valuations.Image Source: Getty ImagesApplied Materials' 1.65% forward dividend yield might be lower than the technology sector's average, but there's a lot to like about the company. First, the stock has shot up over 50% so far in 2019 despite a muted financial performance lately, which shows its resilience and investors' faith in the company's long-term prospects.The rally doesn't seem to be misplaced as it is a solid bet on the rise of the semiconductor industry. It supplies chip fabrication equipment to semiconductor companies, so the demand for its products stands to rise in the future on the back of emerging technology trends -- 5G networks, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving, among others -- that will create the need for more complex chips.The semiconductor industry is going through a lean patch right now, but the company sees a turnaround taking place next year. CEO Gary Dickerson pointed this out on the latest : ""Taking these factors into account, our view of overall wafer fab equipment spending for 2019 remains the same down mid-to-high teens on a percentage basis relative to last year. We see 2020 is a more positive set up for the industry in Applied with the start of a recovery and memory investment and sustained strength in foundry logic spending.""The next reason to buy Applied Materials is valuation. Despite the rally, the stock continues to trade at an affordable valuation. Its trailing  of 15.7 is lower than the company's five-year average multiple of 18. So, now would be a good time to go long on the stock as a turnaround next year could encourage the company to give its dividend a nice bump.I'm saying that because Applied Materials had  payout in early 2018 thanks to a favorable financial performance and its tradition of  of the  back to investors. It has stuck to that tradition despite a fall in its free cash flow over the past year, having returned $724 million to shareholders (share repurchases and dividend payments combined) in the fiscal third quarter when its free cash flow came in at $694 million. data by .Applied Materials' dividend payout was $196 million during the quarter, which was 27% of its free cash flow. Adjusted net income was $692 million in the third quarter. This tells us that Applied Materials treads on the side of conservatism when it comes to the dividend payout, so it has the space to increase the dividend.What's more, the recent uptrend in Applied Materials' free cash flow is likely to continue into the next fiscal year thanks to the turnaround that both the company and Wall Street are expecting. Analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance tell us that Applied Materials' top line could jump 7% next year after a double-digit decline in 2019. Its EPS is estimated to jump from $3 this year to $3.35 next year.Thus, don't be surprised to see the company give its dividend a bigger bump in 2020 as compared to the 5% increase it announced earlier this year.Like Applied Materials, Xilinx's dividend yield of 1.64% might not seem remarkable at first, but the company has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years. Xilinx has delivered consistent dividend growth over the past three years, but it has become conservative as far as the  is concerned.. Data by .Xilinx has paid out $367 million in dividends over the trailing 12 months and generated net income of $941 million. What's more, the company's free cash flow generation has been consistently moving north and sits just over $1.1 billion.The good news for investors is that the company is expected to sustain its bottom-line growth on the back of its market-leading position in the FPGA (field-programmable gate array) market and a  in the automotive, data center, and artificial intelligence verticals.However, Xilinx's near-term guidance  by trade war-related uncertainty as the company had to stop shipments to Huawei in the wake of the Chinese company's addition to the . Lorenzo Flores, Xilinx's CFO, had this to say on the latest :At this point in time, we are monitoring the China trade situation and the overall economic environment. Given the uncertainty of -- regarding these important factors, we are not reiterating or updating our full-year guidance today.Overall, we believe our long-term growth drivers remain very much intact. Although our FY '20 revenue expectations have been somewhat moderated by trade-related concerns, we continue to believe that the second half of our fiscal year will be better than our first half.Xilinx management's confidence that things will get better isn't misplaced. After all, Xilinx's products are of a  in the semiconductor industry and they have allowed the company to overcome broad market uncertainties in the past. Moreover, Huawei supplies a very small portion -- in the low single digits -- of Xilinx's revenue, so the negative impact of the ban shouldn't last for long given  at play.Not surprisingly, analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance indicate that Xilinx will be able to sustain its double-digit revenue growth and also deliver higher earnings in the current and the next fiscal years. So, investors can expect Xilinx's free cash flow profile to improve, which could result in further dividend hikes in the future.. Data by .Finally, Xilinx's P/E multiple of 24.6 is lower than its five-year average multiple of 27. In fact, now seems like a good time to get into the stock thanks to the recent drop in the price, which has made Xilinx cheaper than before.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most important trends to watch for tech investors. More companies are jumping into the space every day, and while stock pickers still have to exercise caution and shouldn't embrace a business just because it touts an AI connection, the players that cement leading roles in this computing shift could enjoy forefront positions in the overall technology space for decades to come.Pure sales and earnings contributions aren't always front and center in earnings reports, but AI is already a big part of the growth story at many top technology companies. Investors looking to get a jump on big news in the artificial intelligence space this month might want to pay attention to  ,  , and   -- three AI leaders that are expected to report earnings before October draws to a close. Image source: Getty Images.Microsoft has been one of the market's biggest large-cap winners in recent years, climbing roughly 200% over the last half-decade and quadrupling the  index's rise over the stretch. With a market capitalization of roughly $1 trillion, it's the biggest company in the U.S. -- and the software giant's tremendous size and industry-shaping initiatives in AI and cloud computing make it a stock for market watchers to keep an eye on. Microsoft is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Oct. 23 and is fresh off a deal with  that will see AI resources used to create new drug treatments. Investors may get a closer look at the deal as well as other AI-related projects with the earnings release and conference call.In a video announcing the Novartis partnership, Nadella said, ""AI is perhaps the most transformational technology of our time, and healthcare is perhaps AI's most pressing application."" The partnership will create an AI innovation lab at Novartis, and it will also see Microsoft lend AI and cloud-computing resources to Novartis employees to make the company's data more accessible and aid in the formulation of new medicines.Many of Microsoft's AI initiatives might not seem immediately connected to its core product offerings, but it's using AI to improve core products like its Windows operating system and expand the feature set and functionality of its Microsoft 365 cloud suite. It's also helping with task automation, analytics-based predictions, and translation -- and bolstering the Azure cloud platform by improving security, device management capabilities, and overall infrastructure.Last quarter, the company's operating expenses increased 24% on a constant currency basis as spending ramped up on cloud and AI engineering and GitHub -- the open-source data and software platform it acquired in a $7.5 billion deal last year. Heavy spending in these areas will likely continue and could drag on near-term earnings performance, but the company has already had considerable success in its pivot to being a cloud- and subscription-focused company, and its AI projects are going to be at the center of the business's push to lead in the next stages of AI and cloud services. Xilinx is another artificial-intelligence leader that's scheduled to report earnings on Oct. 23. The semiconductor company has emerged as an important player to watch in AI and machine learning because of its expertise in processors that can be tailored to new and evolving applications.Most chips are designed with fixed circuits that can carry out a wide range of functions thanks to relatively strong processing power, but Xilinx has specialized in field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips that have typically been weaker but capable of accomplishing more when properly adapted to specific tasks. This added degree of flexibility, combined with improved cost-to-power dynamics for programmable chips, is propelling increased demand for Xilinx's solutions in product categories including AI, 5G networks, and . Amazon and Microsoft already use Xilinx's chips as part of their cloud platforms, and the company is launching new products that are further strengthening its position in AI. Investors might want to keep an eye on the company's Versal ACAP chips in particular. ACAP stands for ""adaptive compute acceleration platform,"" and this new platform of chips has been designed with a heavy focus on AI and applications in data center, automotive, 5G, and the aerospace and defense industries. The company views ACAPs as a major leap forward for data center computing and has stated that the new hardware is up to 20 times faster than current optimum FPGA performance and more than 100 times faster than the best traditional processors. Xilinx began rolling out this new chip platform over the summer, and its upcoming earnings update could provide some color on how demand is shaping up for these intriguing new products.The company's upcoming earnings report could also provide some insight into how the company is dealing with trade sanctions and restrictions on doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei. Xilinx's last  came with the update that the company believed it could resume selling some of its products to Huawei after reviewing the Export Administration Regulations and Entity List, but also that selling opportunities remained blocked in the 5G category. After opting not to reiterate or update its fiscal-year guidance in its first-quarter call, Xilinx expects to provide an update on the full-year outlook in the upcoming , and management's comments could provide fresh information on the strength of momentum for the AI and 5G spaces amid the trade-related uncertainty.Amazon's leadership in e-commerce, cloud platform services, and smart speakers gives it access to a massive amount of data that can be fed into artificial-intelligence systems. With strong resources and a proven willingness to bet big on innovation, it stands out as one of the most important businesses to watch in the AI space.The tech giant is launching its Echo smart-speaker hardware and Alexa voice assistant in Brazil this month -- and rolling out Portuguese language support in the country. Amazon has also recently launched a variety of multilingual support options in markets including America, Canada, and India, and it continues to introduce new features and devices that are expanding the company's voice-assistant ecosystem -- including an Alexa-integrated ring, smart glasses, and connected earbuds. AI and machine-learning algorithms play big roles in voice-based operating system functions and online retail recommendations, and they're also at the heart of the company's push into advertising.  and  have dominated the digital advertising business, but Amazon has been rapidly building a position in the space. Its wealth of data and leadership position in e-commerce and conversational AI should help it continue to gain ground.The company's advertising business helped propel Amazon's ""other"" segment up 117% year over year to come in at $10.1 billion in 2018. Growth has slowed down in recent quarters, coming in at 36% and 37% year over year in the first and second quarters, but the unit is worth monitoring. Digital advertising still has big room for growth, and Amazon's combination of e-commerce, cloud, and AI assets have it poised to be a bigger player in the space.The company projects that its third quarter sales will come in between $66 billion and $70 billion, representing 20.5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the target. Operating income is expected to arrive between $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion, down from $3.7 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Increased hiring in advertising and marketing and initiatives in AI are at the heart of Amazon's spending increases, and fourth-quarter guidance could indicate whether the company is easing up on the gas a bit or moving forward with big investments in order to drive long-term growth. Amazon is expected to release third-quarter earnings results between Oct. 24 and Oct. 26.Like Microsoft, Amazon is one of the biggest companies on the market, and its earnings release will be a highly anticipated (and scrutinized) event that could have implications for overall tech sector performance. In addition to providing new insights on the company's AI initiatives and overall business, results for the quarter and forward guidance could play a role in shaping investor sentiment in the  at a time when people are looking for indicators as to what's next for the market.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Semiconductor stocks have been held hostage by the China-U.S. trade war for over a year. We now live in a connected world so the market fears are legitimate since most of the semiconductor stocks’ profit and loss statements depend heavily on what happens to the commerce with China. There are not only revenue repercussions but supply chain concerns. So the bullish thesis for the semiconductor sector has to include a reasonable resolution to the conflict. With so much on the line, I bet that the governments will eventually come to some sort of boring agreement that saves face for both sides.Meanwhile there are semiconductor stocks to buy even here.This week Micron will report earnings and this will matter to the entire chip sector as a whole. What they say about business going forward will resonate loudly throughout the charts of   (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:), and  (NASDAQ:) to name just three. Today I dissect trading MU, AMD and INTC stocks.MU stock goes in and out of favor often among investors on Wall Street. It has always been a value stock, which is code for not getting the respect it deserves. So value alone is not reason enough to chase upside. Recently MU rallied above $48 per share and this week it may have the opportunity to prove that it belongs up here with its earnings report on September 26.So on Thursday, the bulls have a chance to prove that they can hold $48 per share as forward support. If so, then the upside potential for MU stock can be another 10% or more. Since the short-term reaction to these events is always a coin flip, this is a binary trade when they report earnings. We don’t know what the company is going to say, nor do we know how investors will react to it. If Micron stock falls below $48 then it would be vulnerable to a 10% correction that would fill gaps below.The MU event also offers opportunities to trade other semiconductor stocks like INTC and AMD. Those two are viable proxy bets to the MU earnings report.AMD stock has been the chip champ for two years. It has out-performed even during times when the markets in general were falling. AMD is up 140% in two years which is five times better than its closest competitor.This week, AMD stock has tightened into a point. Meaning there is a move coming but the direction is yet to be determined. If the reaction to Micron is positive then AMD can breakout from its $32 resistance zone. This could also reignite the rally to target $40 per share or more.  Conversely, if the bears are able to push AMD below its recent support near $29.20, then shares could fall another $2 from there.This is all to say that there is an opportunity to trade AMD for the short term. Long term, it remains a buy in my book. So, I will buy-the-dip if it comes this week. Ideally, I would sell premium into the downside fear. For example I can sell the November 26th downside put for over $1 per contract. This would be a rinse-and-repeat trade for me, and I would reopen if the bears punish AMD stock this week.Meanwhile, if I am long AMD stock as a long term investment then I would not change my stance just for the  uncertainty. If adding a new position, I would employ a tight stop below $29. This way if it spikes then I’m I already on board, else I get stopped out with minimal damage.There is a similar setup in Intel stock, but I don’t like the overall body language of this stock. AMD has the advantage of Wall Street loving its current management whereas INTC management is in flux. Nevertheless the upside opportunity in INTC stock is at $53.50. If the bulls are able to take it above that they could cover the gap to 58 quickly. Conversely, there are gaps below that would bring INTC stock back down to is $47 neckline from just a few days ago.The outcome of Intel stock this week just like AMD revolves around what happens on Friday morning when Micron trades its earnings results. Fundamentally, all three stocks belong at least at these levels, but the headline risk is still binary as it always is with earnings reports. Investors love to extrapolate the results of one company into another which is almost always a mistake. In any of these cases, I would wait for confirmation of the breakouts or breakdowns before chasing them.Jumping the gun can be costly. These are momentum stocks so when they run they do it fast and long. So discipline is important when trading them especially for the shorter term. Value alone is not an argument for support so it’s more important to pay more attention to the actual technical levels on the charts.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

"  has lost its wheels spectacularly in 2019. There seemed to be no stopping Xilinx stock earlier this year as the company was  to take advantage of fast-growing markets. But tragedy struck once it emerged that the company is  of the U.S.-China trade war.Not surprisingly, investors have offloaded Xilinx stock, and it has lost around a quarter of its value in the past six months. But savvy investors should not ignore Xilinx, which looks like a great value right now and is sitting on several catalysts that could ensure long-term growth.Let's take a look at the three reasons Xilinx stock is worth buying right now.Image Source: Getty Images.Xilinx is known for making field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These are programmable chips that can be bought off the shelves by developers and configured to perform specific tasks. The advantage with FPGAs is that their functionality can be tweaked each time the device is powered up. Developers simply need to download a new configuration file into the FPGA and change the way it works.The flexibility that FPGAs provide allows for a quicker time to market. This is the reason they are being used in 5G network deployments, boosting Xilinx's  of late. But 5G is just one of the many areas in which FPGAs are being deployed.For instance, FPGAs are being used in data centers to accelerate workloads. A third-party estimate projects that the market for data center accelerators will grow at a whopping compound annual growth rate of almost 50% through 2023. FPGAs are expected to enjoy the highest growth rate during this period as compared to other accelerators such as graphics processing units.That's because FPGAs are capable of providing higher computational speeds and consume less power for the tasks they are designed to carry out. This allows data center operators to bring down operating costs.FPGAs are also finding traction in the automotive space. Xilinx has been witnessing impressive growth in its  thanks to the adoption of its chips by auto component suppliers, who have been incorporating its FPGAs into advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Xilinx claims to have already shipped more than 100 million of them to its automotive customers, and that number should keep growing in the long run as ADAS deployments gain steam.So Xilinx can tap into a diversified pool of opportunities thanks to the versatility of the FPGAs it sells.Xilinx is one of the best bets to take advantage of the FPGA opportunity because of its dominant position in this space. The chipmaker reportedly commands a 60% share of the FPGA market, outpacing bigger rival   thanks to its technology advantage.The overall FPGA market is expected to be worth $11 billion by 2025, according to one estimate. Given that Xilinx has generated $3.2 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, it has the potential to significantly increase its revenue in the long run if it keeps hold of its strong FPGA market share.The good news is that Xilinx has started sampling its 7-nanometer Versal chip to customers. The company  that Versal is capable of delivering ""10x increase in performance and significant power efficiency gains for a number of applications compared to the latest generation FPGAs and general-purpose processors.""Intel, on the other hand, has also started  its 10nm Agilex FPGAs to select customers, promising 40% performance gains and an identical reduction in power consumption as compared to its previous-generation chips. But because Intel's 7nm chips are still a couple of years away, Xilinx could continue to enjoy a technology advantage over Chipzilla and maintain its lead in the FPGA space.The final reason Xilinx is a good bet right now is its valuation. A trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 26 is slightly lower than the five-year average multiple of just over 27. But at the same time, the company's earnings growth is expected to gain momentum. data by .In all, Xilinx's potentially strong earnings growth, a cheaper valuation than before, and the catalysts listed above make it a .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

hipmakers   and   started 2019 on a bright note, but the two ' paths have diverged over the past few months.While AMD has managed to sustain its momentum thanks to  over rivals  and  , Xilinx has lost its way in the wake of the . But is this a good enough reason to buy AMD stock instead of Xilinx? Let's find out.Image Source: Getty ImagesAMD is making substantial gains against arch-rival NVIDIA in graphics card production and sales. Jon Peddie Research's second-quarter discrete GPU (graphics processing unit) report points out that AMD controlled 32.1% of the graphics card market, with NVIDIA commanding the rest. That was a big improvement over AMD's first-quarter discrete GPU market share of 22.7%. In fact, AMD shipped more graphics cards than NVIDIA in the second quarter of the year.This isn't surprising as AMD looked  NVIDIA's GPU supremacy earlier this year thanks to its move to 7-nanometer graphics cards that were supposed to be more powerful, power-efficient, and pocket-friendly.AMD didn't disappoint as the Radeon VII -- the world's first 7nm graphics card -- that was launched in January this year, turned out to be 29% faster while gaming and 36% faster during content creation than the RX Vega 64, without any increase in power consumption. The card's  and a strong showing against NVIDIA's flagship offering seem to have worked in AMD's favor and allowed it to gain a leg up over its archrival.AMD is rolling out 7nm GPUs, promising beefier performance at affordable prices. On the other hand, NVIDIA's 7nm Ampere GPUs are rumored to arrive in the first half of 2020, which means that AMD will be enjoying a technology advantage for at least the next few months.A similar story is unfolding in the CPU space, where AMD's Ryzen chips are giving Intel . AMD is closing in on 20% CPU market share, and it won't be long before it gets there, as powerhouse Intel seems to be facing .In all, AMD's technology advantage over its rivals can pave the way for more market share gains and help the company .Xilinx's high-flying run on the stock market has been tempered by the trade war as shipping restrictions for Huawei have cast a cloud of uncertainty over Xilinx's guidance. Spooked investors have scrambled to book profits, as the near-term uncertainty has been hitting the company's financial performance.Xilinx projects fiscal second-quarter revenue growth of 10.6%. This is a tad disappointing, as the company was enjoying a terrific tailwind from the deployment of 5G networks, but Huawei's blacklisting  of a big opportunity in China.However, it would be wrong on investors' part to miss the bigger picture here. Xilinx's reliance on Huawei is , and it can make a dent in 5G markets beyond China. This was evident from the fact that the company's wired and wireless segment revenue shot up 66% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020  the restrictions on Huawei.Of course, there will be a slowdown in the pace of growth of the 5G business in the coming quarters, but Xilinx has enough firepower to offset that thanks to its  in the market for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips.FPGAs have gained traction in the cloud and other fast-growing areas, such as automotive advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Xilinx's chips are already being used by major cloud providers such as  and  to accelerate data center workloads. The market for data center accelerators is booming, and Xilinx is  to take advantage.The automotive business is also  thanks to the company's partnerships with well-known component suppliers to whom it supplies its FPGAs for deployment in ADAS solutions.All of this indicates that Xilinx can rely on multiple catalysts to drive its long-term growth.We can conclude that both Xilinx and AMD are going down the right path and are primed to deliver top- and bottom-line growth in the long run.Analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance tell us that AMD's growth will go up a few notches in the coming fiscal year, with revenue expected to grow at a 20%-plus rate along with a substantial jump in earnings. Xilinx is also expected to deliver stable, double-digit growth in the current fiscal year and the next. data by However, investors will have to pay a rich multiple to enjoy AMD's faster growth rate. The stock has a trailing  of nearly 156, though the forward multiple is much more reasonable at 26.6. Xilinx's valuation is far more conservative, with a trailing P/E multiple of 24.3 and a forward earnings multiple of 21.5.So investors with a lower appetite for risk can choose Xilinx over AMD. But if you're willing to pay a higher multiple in exchange for stronger growth potential, AMD could prove to be a good bet given the inroads it is making into the territory of its rivals.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"he  formula at  ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive.  Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most ""interesting"" ideas that merit further research by investors.


But making Xilinx, Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of XLNX entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $91.08 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.  A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  

In the case of Xilinx, Inc., the RSI reading has hit 28.4 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 55.0.  A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield.  Indeed, XLNX's recent annualized dividend of 1.48/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.54% based upon the recent $95.90 share price.


A bullish investor could look at XLNX's 28.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.  Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on XLNX is its dividend history.  

In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

"nvestors eyeing a purchase of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $96.09/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2022 put at the $60 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.20.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8.7% return against the $60 commitment, or a 3.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).



Selling a put does not give an investor access to XLNX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $60 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Xilinx, Inc. sees its shares fall 37.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $54.80 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.20 from $60), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.7% annualized rate of return.


				Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.7% figure actually exceeds the 1.5% annualized dividend paid by Xilinx, Inc. by 2.2%, based on the current share price of $96.09.  And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 37.61% to reach the $60 strike price.  
				
Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.5% annualized dividend yield.


   Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $60 strike is located relative to that history:
  

   
The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2022 put at the $60 strike for the 3.7% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Xilinx, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $96.09) to be 47%.

In mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.36M contracts, with call volume at 1.70M, for a put:call ratio of 0.80 so far for the day, which is unusually high compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65.  In other words, there are lots more put buyers out there in options trading so far today than would normally be seen, as compared to call buyers.

	This is a slap in the face to all fearmongers scaring investors out of owning great stocks just because the U.S. and China are negotiating a trade deal in a less than ideal setting.These headlines wreak havoc in AMD and the  (NYSEARCA:) as a whole. While the stock prices go for a ride, their fundamentals remain intact. In fact the demand for AMD products and services has a runway at least a decade long. And as long as they have strong management like they have with current CEO Lisa Su, then there is no reason to sell the stock over short-term fears.Sure, a tweet here or a media headline there could get the traders’ attentions, but it’s not a reason alone to change the investment thesis for the stock. There is no evidence yet that the US and China won’t eventually come to terms. So the prospects for AMD stock remain bullish.If I own AMD already, then I’m staying long. Otherwise, I treat the dips as opportunities to buy AMD stock for the long term. It has performed most consistently in the sector even last year when markets were correcting hard.Fundamentally, it’s not cheap but that doesn’t matter. AMD is still a growth company, so when I evaluate those types I don’t look for profitability. Instead, I need them to grow a lot. And in order to do that they need to spend a lot. Moreover, AMD stock sells at only 5 times sales. So while the price-to-earnings ratio is scary to some, the stock is not bloated given its growth trajectory.In addition, technically AMD stock is still in the hands of the bulls. The weekly chart shows a clear ascending channel. And as long as the lower edges continue to hold, then the AMD bears will have a hard time taking control of the price action.Short term there are important levels to note. For the last few weeks, AMD stock price range is between $27.50 and $34 per share. The breach of either sides will carry momentum in that direction. Also, since the beginning of August, AMD has been setting higher-lows attacking a neckline at $32 per share. If the bulls can break above it then they could rally another $3 from there. And that would launch the opportunity of the next leg higher.If the general equity markets cooperate, that would fuel the AMD buy programs to exceed $35 per share. But conversely, if the bears are able to bring AMD stock below $29 per share, then they may have the opportunity to trigger a $3 bearish pattern. So clearly the next few weeks are important to recommit to the direction of the next wave in Advanced Micro Devices stock price.Of all the chip stocks, AMD is the only one I would bet on these days. It has had the fewest fake-outs. Both stocks of  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) have disappointed investors several times in recent months. So I consider AMD stock as the best bet on the upside potential of all chip stocks if not the market as a whole.If stocks are higher in the future, then AMD is definitely higher. To that, the bearish consensus is starting to build. The media is pushing the notion that we are in the late stages of the economic expansion. Meaning that a recession is coming. While that is eventually true, there is no evidence yet that a recession is imminent.I just find it hard to believe that we could have the economies shrink when everyone is employed and rates are so low. Admittedly, these are unprecedented times so there are no real experts on what comes next. Therefore I stick with my bullish thesis for as long as the data continues to be in line with expectations as it has been.Companies like AMD are still delivering excellent profit and loss statements with good balance sheets. And the consumer in the US is still spending with extreme vigor, because everyone that wants a job has one. Just like it’s not a good idea to buy a stock in anticipation of something without confirmation, it is a mistake to anticipate a rescission without confirmation of its impending arrival.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

"f you were looking for  earlier in 2019,   and   would have definitely been on your radar, as both of them were surging impressively on strong investor sentiment.But tragedy struck in the form of the trade war, putting NVIDIA and Xilinx's prospects in hot water and ending the stocks' terrific runs. Xilinx cannot ship all of its chips to Chinese customers, and demand for NVIDIA's graphics cards could take a hit as the company is forced to increase prices thanks to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. government.In such a scenario, which of these two chip stocks should you be putting your money on?Image Source: Getty ImagesGraphics cards manufacturers like NVIDIA could be hurt badly by the trade war, as a chunk of the company's supply chain is situated in China, according to CEO Jensen Huang. He also clarified that NVIDIA has ""a few thousand"" employees in China.So importing components sourced from the China-centric supply chain into the U.S. means that NVIDIA may have to pay higher tariffs. The graphics specialist can either absorb those tariffs at the cost of its margins, or raise the price of its GPUs to pass on the increased cost to customers.The situation became more challenging for NVIDIA after President Trump announced that the U.S. will now impose tariffs at a rate of 30% on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, instead of the earlier 25%. But what's more concerning is that the Trump administration is imposing tariffs of 15% on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports beginning Dec. 15.The import tariff on computer parts such as graphics cards and motherboards was raised in May this year to 25% from the prior 10%, causing a crash in NVIDIA stock. Those tariffs have now been hiked to 30%. What's more, tariffs on laptops are set to go into effect from Dec. 15.So there's a good chance that NVIDIA will have to sell its graphics cards at a higher price thanks to the trade war. This isn't an ideal situation for the company to be in, as it has just been overtaken by rival  in PC GPU shipments for the first time in half a decade.Moreover, the U.S.-China trade war presents another kind of challenge for NVIDIA. Huang had said last year that China accounts for a third of NVIDIA's business. This is bad news for NVIDIA shareholders, as the negative effects of the trade war are contributing toward a slowdown in the Chinese economy.The country's industrial production growth of 4.8% in July this year was the weakest pace in a decade. Another alarming data point was that retail sales increased 7.6% in July, down from the 9.8% growth witnessed in June.If the Chinese start cutting back on purchases of graphics cards and laptops, NVIDIA's declining top-line might not be turning around anytime soon given its reliance on this market.Like NVIDIA, Xilinx is also reliant on Chinese companies such as Huawei for a portion of its revenue. But it doesn't have a single 10%-plus customer, which means that its exposure is not as high as NVIDIA's.This is why Xilinx is still delivering impressive growth despite the trade war being in full swing. The chipmaker delivered 24% revenue growth in its last-reported quarter, even though it was not able to ship to Huawei thanks to export restrictions.What's more, Xilinx's outlook for the current quarter suggests that the company is anticipating year-over-year revenue growth of 16% at the mid-point of its guidance range. So Xilinx is in a much better position compared to NVIDIA, which saw its revenue crash 17% annually during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.Also, NVIDIA's revenue outlook of $2.9 billion for the current quarter puts its year over year revenue decline at just over 8%. But investors shouldn't rule out the possibility of more downside thanks to the recently hiked tariffs.Xilinx, on the other hand, isn't as exposed to China as NVIDIA is. The company is enjoying terrific growth in fifth-generation (5G) markets across the globe, as shown by CEO Victor Peng's comments on the latest :Despite our complete suspension of shipments to Huawei in the middle of the quarter, we saw continued strong demand at many of our wired and wireless customers in support of global 5G deployments.Given that Huawei reportedly supplies 8% of Xilinx's total revenue, Xilinx should be able to offset the negative impact of export restrictions to the Chinese company by growing in other geographies where 5G networks are being deployed.The advantage for Xilinx is that its programmable chips can be  and programmed by telecom companies deploying 5G networks. This allows them to reduce the time to market. A  report points out that just 7% of telecom providers across the globe have rolled out 5G networks, so there's a huge addressable market for Xilinx out there as 5G is still in its early phases of growth.Xilinx can take advantage of that opportunity thanks to its  in programmable chips and limited Chinese exposure.NVIDIA could be in much deeper trouble thanks to the trade war, and the stock's valuation is another reason why investors should stay away from it. With a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 41, NVIDIA is relatively expensive compared to Xilinx's multiple of 29.Paying a richer earnings multiple for NVIDIA doesn't make sense, especially because its revenue has been trending lower. Xilinx, on the other hand, has been able to maintain its double-digit growth despite the macroeconomic issues at play, and trades at a cheaper valuation. That is why it is a better bet than NVIDIA in the current circumstances.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and NVIDIA wasn't one of them!

n the midst of a fairly forgettable year,   has finally done something noteworthy: Last month, it started shipping its Agilex field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to early access customers, including .Why is this important? Well, rival   has been enjoying  of late thanks to its dominance in this  niche. Intel, by contrast, had been  on the FPGA curve. But with the debut of this new line, which is built on its 10-nanometer platform, Chipzilla should be able to challenge Xilinx for a significant piece of the FPGA pie.Image Source: Getty Images.In the second quarter, revenue from Intel's programmable solutions group (PSG) fell 5% year over year to $489 million. This was in sharp contrast with Xilinx's latest quarterly report, which revealed a 24% increase in total revenue to a record $850 million.Xilinx is a pure-play provider of FPGAs -- chips that can be bought off the shelf and configured to perform a variety of tasks. Their advantage is that they're reprogrammable, so customers can make tweaks to their functionality.That flexibility is why FPGAs have been in high demand by telecoms that are deploying  wireless networks across the globe, and Xilinx has been a prime beneficiary of that demand. Revenue from the chipmaker's wired and wireless segment shot up 66% year over year last quarter, as its FPGAs have gained traction in markets such as South Korea where 5G deployments are in full swing.Intel, by contrast, has largely been left out of the party.Xilinx has prospered in this niche because it had a significant technological lead. It was  14/16-nanometer FPGAs, and they reached the market a year before Intel's competing product. By the time Intel's 14nm FPGAs arrived, Xilinx had scored more than 200 customers.But with its Agilex FPGAs, Intel has narrowed the lag to just two months as Xilinx only started shipping its 7nm Versal ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform) chips in June.Intel says that its Agilex FPGAs are well-suited to the needs of data centers and 5G networks because they can ramp up performance and lower power consumption. In fact, Intel says that Agilex can deliver 40% higher performance than its previous-generation Stratix FPGAs, or reduce power consumption by 40% compared to those chips.What's more, Intel says that the artificial intelligence (AI) capability of the Agilex FPGAs will help its customers build smarter networks thanks to real-time insights.Xilinx had similar things to say a couple of months ago when it began the commercial shipments of its Versal line, asserting that its new chips are more capable than conventional FPGAs, and can be deployed in data centers, automotive applications, and 5G networks.So both companies now seem to be toe-to-toe in the FPGA space, and Intel has already fired its salvo by landing Microsoft as a partner. This is an important development as Microsoft had reportedly picked Xilinx's FPGAs to power more than half of its Azure cloud servers less than a year ago.There's now a possibility that Intel could close its big gap with Xilinx in the FPGA space and significantly boost its PSG revenue.Moreover, annual revenues in the FPGA market are expected to clock in at more than $11 billion by 2025, according to estimates. So Intel has a lot to gain -- and with Agilex, a real chance to gain it.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" (NASDAQ:) stock was a Wall Street darling not too long ago. But lately it has lost its shine and now cannot hold a rally long enough to flip this massive down slide that started last year. Year-to-date, Nvidia stock still lags the chip champ  (NASDAQ:) by more than half.Source: Shutterstock
	On its way up to $290 per share, NVDA rode the Bitcoin craze up fast. But as the Bitcoin mining headlines faded, the Nvidia stock price fell off a cliff. Ironically, at the highs of almost $300 per share the consensus among experts was that NVDA was a must-buy. Now that it’s a lot cheaper with almost all the same fundamentals that supported the rally, it’s hard to find any fans of it on Wall Street.Fundamentally speaking NVDA stock is not cheap at 45 price-to-earnings ratio. But owning it at these levels for the long term is not likely to be a giant debacle. This is especially true for patient investors. The company is well set to capitalize on several segments for the next decade of tech.Shorter-term, it is important to pay attention to what the clues in the Nvidia stock chart suggest. There are definite levels that stand out from the latest price action.Traders reacted positively to the earnings report this week. NVDA spiked 15% and is now trying to hold the rally in order to extend it. It is important for it to hold higher-lows and break out from $180 per share. If the bulls are able to do this, Nvidia stock should trigger a bullish cup-and-handle breakout to target $200 per share or higher.This won’t be easy and there will be resistance, first at the neckline, then at $194 per share. These two levels have been significant prior failure zones. So the onus is on the NVDA stock bulls to prove that they can hold the trend of higher-lows in order to attack the neckline that has so far proven so elusive.For that to happen, Nvidia will need the help of the general markets. This week is another potentially pivotal week for stocks, as today we get the Federal Reserve minutes from their last meeting. And on Friday we hear from the Chairman himself. Recently Fed head Jerome Powell’s effect on the markets has been very violent. So coming into the event on Friday the NVDA trade is somewhat binary. Short term, it has more gambling than investing in it.The fear index — the  (INDEXCBOE:) — is still elevated but nowhere near critical levels. Only days ago it was pushing $25 per share and now it’s below $20. So there is no obvious ramp up in fear, even as equities hang this close to all-time highs in the  for example.In other words, this market is indeed climbing the wall of worry. And with a little bit of luck, the rally continues so that Nvidia stock can actually breakout of this funk and recover some old glory.Depending on the portfolio, it is okay to hold or buy NVDA here in anticipation of the breakout as long as investors place proper stops below.Alternatively, instead of buying upside hope, we can sell downside risk into the Nvidia stock price. For example, you can sell the Dec $130 put and collect $2 per contract to open. This way you don’t even need a rally to profit as long as Nvidia stock stays above that level, you are a 100% winner. The breakeven from that trade would be at $128 per share. Below it, you would own the shares and accrue losses.Regardless of what you decide to do, you should do it in tranches. This leaves room for adjusting the risk if and when it’s needed.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Meanwhile,  (NASDAQ:) may have made less of an overall impact, but still logged a bigger gain by rallying nearly 8% after D.A.

Here’s why, and what may come next.The past few weeks have been tough ones for railroad stocks. Norfolk Southern has been no exception.Since the middle of last month, things have seemingly changed. NSC stock appears to have found support — or perhaps made support — before matters got too far out of hand. While there’s reason for optimism, there’s also reason for concern. One more slip-up from here could crack a couple of different key floors and send Norfolk shares off the rails.It’s been anything but a straight-line effort, but Iqvia Holdings has been a surprisingly rewarding name over the past several years. Buying on the dip has been a savvy strategy’ It still is.To that end, though some could and would argue that the lull witnessed since late June technically qualifies as a dip since it was stopped at an established technical floor, that may not be the case at all. One stumble could easily break that support level and send IQV stock to a better-established support level. And, the subtle clues suggest that’s the more-likely outcome here.Finally, with just a quick glance, it seems Xilinx shares have sidestepped trouble. Finding the same floor they found in May, the pullback that started in late July has been halted as of last week.A closer look at the chart of XLNX stock, however, reveals shares may not be as risk-free as first thought. The stock is finding resistance at a place it can’t afford to face resistance, and that could buy the bears just enough time to shore up their defensive line and force Xilinx to lose ground.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA ETF (Symbol: LRGF), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $34.78 per unit.


With LRGF trading at a recent price near $31.41 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.74% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of LRGF's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Carnival Corp (Symbol: CCL), AES Corp. (Symbol: AES), and Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX). Although CCL has traded at a recent price of $43.89/share, the average analyst target is 22.27% higher at $53.67/share. Similarly, AES has 20.18% upside from the recent share price of $15.29 if the average analyst target price of $18.38/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting XLNX to reach a target price of $122.64/share, which is 19.90% above the recent price of $102.29. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CCL, AES, and XLNX:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

he U.S.-China trade war is turning out to be a nightmare for chipmakers that rely on Chinese companies for business, and   is no different. The chipmaker's fiscal 2020 second-quarter guidance  thanks to the overall macroeconomic uncertainty, weak data center demand, and the suspension of shipments to Huawei.As expected, investors have decided to book profits at the first sign of trouble, and the stock is down over 13% in the past two months. But this is an opportunity in disguise for anyone looking to buy into  at a reasonable valuation.Image Source: Getty ImagesXilinx management doesn't seem to be too perturbed by the ban on shipments to Huawei. That's probably because Xilinx doesn't have a single customer that produces more than 10% of its revenue, so the overall growth story still remains intact thanks to the company's diversified interests in areas such as data centers, automotive, and wireless networks.And as it turns out, Xilinx's automotive, industrial, and wired/wireless business segments did extremely well last quarter. Revenue from the wired and wireless business segment  up 66% annually thanks to the deployment of . This is a great sign for Xilinx, showing that the Huawei situation didn't throw water over the  the chipmaker has seen this year.The reason Xilinx's 5G business didn't lose its wheels can be credited to the nature of the chips it sells. Xilinx's chips -- popularly known as FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) -- come in handy during new infrastructure deployments. The programmable chips can be bought by developers straight off the shelves and configured to perform the desired tasks. They are in strong demand among telecom companies deploying 5G networks, as FPGAs reduce their time to market.As a result, demand for Xilinx's chips should remain strong as 5G networks are deployed across the globe, especially because the company holds  of the FPGA market.The good news for Xilinx investors is that only 7% of the communications service providers have already deployed 5G networks, according to . The market research firm also pointed out that 5G infrastructure spending will jump nearly 61% next year to $6.8 billion as service providers ramp up deployments. So the 5G opportunity for Xilinx is still in its nascent phase, as a huge number of communication providers have yet to join the bandwagon.Huawei would have been a big catalyst for Xilinx because of the clout it enjoys in the Chinese telecom infrastructure space. This is probably why Xilinx has been pushing the U.S. government to ease restrictions on exports to Huawei. But even if that doesn't happen in the foreseeable future, Xilinx's 5G business has enough firepower to keep growing and boost its wired/wireless segment, which supplies 41% of its total revenue.Investors shouldn't forget that 5G is just one of the many drivers for Xilinx's business. The company's FPGA chips are also being deployed in other markets, such as data centers and automotive applications.The automotive business, for example, is solidly positioned to take advantage of the proliferation of connected and self-driving cars thanks to Xilinx's  in this space. The chipmaker's FPGAs are already being used to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled self-driving computers by the likes of ZF, while Chinese car company BYD has selected Xilinx's chips to make a camera-based advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS).Xilinx admits that the automotive business will remain soft in the near-term thanks to the trade war, but that doesn't change the long-term narrative. Demand for FPGAs in the automotive sector is estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 8.5% through 2022, as per third-party estimates.Similarly, FPGA demand in the data center space is also gaining traction as data centers accelerate their workloads. Xilinx's data center revenue was zooming thanks to the adoption of FPGAs by the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and other cloud service providers.Xilinx's data center business, meanwhile, might have hit a speed bump on account of the trade war and a product transition at one of its customers. According to CFO Lorenzo Flores on the company's :Revenue from the Data Center Group was below our guidance, declining 13% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter. We showed growth in multiple hyperscalers and broader accounts, but the Huawei ban did have an effect on DCG.

"he first half of 2019 is in the record books, and technology continues to lead the way forward for the economy. Organizations around the globe are adopting new digital-based operations, creating a tidal wave of change that is seeding big growth for many smaller companies.Yet many investors are fretting over the news of impending global economic slowdown, with whispers of the R-word -- recession -- building to a chorus of concern.In spite of the news, fundamental changes in investing segments like TV, healthcare, and computing are creating a long-term tailwind for , , and . Here's why these three technologists look like a good buy for the long haul no matter what happens next.Television is changing, and with it, the way advertisers reach their audiences. Rather than a traditional broadcast, the world is increasingly consuming TV content via the internet -- through a TV hooked up to the internet, or via a myriad of other devices like  TV, , a video game console, etc. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are watching connected TV, and the number of hours they spend doing so is on the rise. The reasons for consumers' move from traditional TV are varied and even include a desire to get away from advertising. But regardless of the reason, it's actually good news for advertisers. Internet-based TV means more detailed information on the potential audience -- who's watching, when, and what they're interested in.That's where digital ad-buying company The Trade Desk comes in. The company helps businesses target and optimize advertising delivered through connected TVs, digital audio, and apps. Connected TV and audio have been massive growth drivers as internet-based entertainment has really taken off. Through the first half of 2019, revenues are up 42% year over year, and adjusted earnings are up 52%. The Trade Desk's stock isn't cheap, though, going for 78 times the next year's expected earnings and 21 times trailing 12-month revenue. So why buy now? A myriad of new streaming TV services are going to come online this fall, including 's , to be bundled with Hulu and ESPN+, and Apple's Apple TV+.  also changed its policy and will allow The Trade Desk to start offering targeted ads on its TV services. In short, there's a lot of potential ahead for this company, and it could be one of the best ways to ride the boom in streaming TV services that is set to take place.  The cost of health goods and services has been outpacing average inflation for some time, and U.S. government projections expect that trend to continue for the next decade. One answer to the problem is telemedicine -- patient visits with a healthcare professional via phone or internet. The U.S. telemedicine industry is expected to grow an average of 27% a year in the next five years and reach $13 billion a year by 2023, according to Research and Markets. Image source: Getty Images.Enter Teladoc, the global leader in virtual care. Through acquisition and starting new in-house services, Teladoc now dominates the U.S. telemedicine industry and has a growing presence overseas as well. The company's goal is to make accessing care more convenient and affordable, helping health providers, insurers, and businesses get patients connected to a health professional in a way that works best for them. Through the first half of 2019, total patient visits grew 73%, subscription access fees (membership fees paid to access Teladoc's healthcare network) increased 43%, and visits fees (paid when a patient visits a professional via phone or internet conference) were up 27%. Teladoc runs at a loss, as it is trying to maximize growth now rather than focus on the bottom line. And that is perhaps what has caused this stock some trouble. Over the last trailing 12 months, shares are down 18% in spite of solid top-line expansion and a growing network of patients. After the recent tumble, brought about in part by a widening loss in  and recent stock market volatility, Teladoc looks like a good buy for the long term. With more people opting for the convenience of remote care rather than heading for the local doctor's office, Teladoc should be a much bigger player in the healthcare industry in 10 years' time than it is now.   is the oldest company of the three mentioned by a long shot (it was established back in 1984 in Silicon Valley), but its programmable semiconductors have been getting renewed interest in the last few years. Xilinx's customizable chips and supporting software solutions are particularly well suited to cloud computing, AI-powered computing, and 5G mobile networks. Spending on the first two initiatives is expected to continue growing in the double digits for the foreseeable future as those initiatives create value for businesses around the globe, and 5G networks are only just starting to be . Nevertheless, the global economic slowdown, hastened by the trade war between the U.S. and China, has hit Xilinx's growth trajectory. After revenues and adjusted earnings increased 24% and 32%, respectively, during the 2019 fiscal year,  revenues and adjusted earnings slowed to 24% and 29%. Management's outlook for the next quarter is for a further cooling off, with sales expected to be up ""only"" 7% to 14% year over year. The stock has subsequently fallen in double digits from its all-time highs back in the spring. Clearly, Xilinx is not immune to trade disputes and other economic disruption, but that it can still muster those kinds of numbers in the face of adversity is impressive. With computing processes undergoing rapid change, there's no reason to believe this chipmaker's growth story will end anytime soon. Rather than being bad news, the recent slowdown looks like a buying opportunity, a mere speed bump that will soon be forgotten as Xilinx continues to power change with its brand of programmable semiconductor systems.2019 has been a solid year for investors so far, providing a big rally after the dismal end to 2018. Global economic growth is putting this year's gains at risk, but The Trade Desk, Teladoc, and Xilinx are solid picks anyway. Even in a recession, money is still spent, and there's a good chance these three will continue to pick up new business no matter which direction the economy decides to head.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Global stock markets are still trading violently but the U.S. equities are still battling close to the all-time highs. So the upside potential is still viable. Wednesday we saw strong earnings reports. This confirm that there are still stock trades to hunt in spite of the geopolitical risks and rhetoric.Our five stock trade to watch for Thursday include:  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:),  (NYSE:),  (NASDAQ:), and BitcoinWMT stock is near all time highs and for good reason. The company has taken the fight to  (NASDAQ:) head on and it’s doing well against this formidable opponent.Investors loved the earnings report last week and WMT stock rallied 8% on the headline. From here, there could be better entry points for the short term. WMT stock is vulnerable to fade and a retest of $110 per share. Maybe even fill the gap $2 lower. But for the long term, this company will continue to deliver and adapt to the market demands. If I am long WMT already, then I stay long. Otherwise I would buy the dips for the long term.Wednesday,  (NYSE:) stock soared as they reported a strong quarter. This confirms the strength of the U.S. consumer spending and operational success. Both companies are winners because of strong execution. WMT is employing technology trend to better compete with AMZN one to one and beat it.LOW stock spiked today after a strong earnings report. The investor expectations were tepid going into the event so it made for an easy hurdle. This however is not the time to pile into LOW stock and chase this rally.The reason the expectations were low is because it has a long history of trailing its competition  (NASDAQ:). I believe this continues until we get several reports to prove otherwise. Case in point, HD stock is up 26% year-to-date which 60% better than LOW. This is also true for the last five year stats.So if I took in profits from the LOW stock reaction to earnings, I would book it for now. From here, it carries the risk of a fade to fill the gap below especially if markets in general correct. This is not the same as shorting the stock.So if I want to remain constructive on the segment, I would rotate my risk into HD stock instead. This one is sitting at another breakout line. Even though the LOW report shows domestic comparable sales beat those of HD, over the long term HD stock has performed better thanks to more consistent management execution.BABA stock has an interesting setup brewing. It will be tough to trigger but the reward if they do so is great. If the BABA stock bulls can break above $180, they can target $192 per share or higher. It won’t be easy and there will be resistance at the neckline and at $185.For a while, BABA stock has been lurking just under this breakout level and doing it from higher lows. But this is a steep rising wedge which leaves the stock vulnerable to pullbacks. If the general markets cooperate then BABA will make this happen; it’s a matter of time.This would then fill an old gap and also places it at a was prior fail. The interesting part is that was also a neckline that if bulls can break could carry it to $200 per share or higher.On pullbacks, BABA stock could fade to $170 which is just above its yearly point of control where bulls and bears loved to fight.XLNX stock is no stranger to headlines. The whole chip sector has been in the line of fire in the economic war between the US and China. XLNX stock moves more on headlines extrinsic to its own execution than not.But Tuesday XLNX fell on headlines of possible “unpatchable” security flaw in its equipment. So this is a rare dump from intrinsic problems. Nevertheless, this dip places XLNX sock at a place with it makes sense that it mounts a rally soon.XLNX stock bulls defended the $100 mark hard on the May correction and yesterday’s scare didn’t even come near it. So as long as the support band below holds, it is likely that XLNX makes another run at $120 per share. There will be resistance at $109 and $113, but if the general markets rally then XLNX can slice through them and reach it major accident scene from the end of July.Since the love-fest with bitcoin of 2017 the interest in the digital coin has not abated. While it’s not hogging the headline it is still a hot debate. Skepticism is high so Bitcoin has a questionable reputation on main street and Wall Street.Both extremes are wrong when it comes to bitcoin. It has value because people say so. This is no different than gold. Bitcoin and gold are rare and people want them so they will continue to be valuable on that assumption. Critics say that it’s used for illicit activities and to that I say that so is cash. At least with bitcoin, they always leave an electronic trace. Furthermore, FIAT cash only has value because the people say so. So in essence cash and bitcoin are more similar than we think.What’s the best place to buy bitcoin? This depends on time frame. If I am buying it like gold as a long term investment then timing really doesn’t matter much. But there are clues on the charts to offer some guidance.  here is falling into support. So in theory it should bounce back up to 10,200.

Last week it found support at a (very) familiar spot, and in the meantime we’ve moved to within reach of what could prove to be a hugely catalytic technical event.Xilinx shares have been fighting a losing battle since July 24, when a budding rally quickly rolled over and turned into a selloff.

	This is not the same as saying to short the stock — it’s just the right thing to do while managing a successful active trading portfolio.MU stock has been in a whirlwind, but that’s mostly due to outside factors more than any problems of its own. It and the rest of the chip sector are stuck in the line of fire during the U.S. and China’s economic war. The two nations are negotiating in the headlines, and stocks like Micron suffer the consequences.In spite of this, most recently MU rallied $15 after the April correction. And it looks like it’s headed much higher.Even though the chart show another $9 in upside potential, it could first suffer a small dip along the way. So if I am fundamentally long Micron stock, I stay with it. But for the cautious shorter-term traders who prefer to be active, they better wait out the next dollar move before initiating a new position.This recent rally brings it back to about the halfway point from the correction that started in May of 2018. This is often a natural resistance level. It also matches Fibonacci logic and the machines usually act on them. So MU stock on its way higher may still stumble here, but it should find support around $40 per share. I would chase it up once it clears the next $2.Fundamentally, Micron stock is cheap but could get much cheaper. Just recently, it fell to under 3 price-to-earnings ratio. However Wall Street is convinced that this MU is a value trap and it has the tendency to lock people into it on the premise of it being cheap. So that alone is not a reason to own it.The semiconductor industry as a whole has a bright future ahead. The world now demands more technology than ever, and this is a trend that will exponentially build from here. There are only a few suppliers for this technology and Micron is one of them.Last night  (NASDAQ:) reported a strong report so it’s more proof that these companies are thriving in spite of the headwinds. They are doing all they can in order to offset the effects of the political headlines that are wreaking havoc with the natural order of business.The demand for Micron products and services can only increase, and since management is a proven winner, the stock will be higher in the future. Of course it will need the help of the overall stock market. MU won’t fall on its own, so if the market is higher in the future then so it is MU stock.Since MU has a ton of value, it makes it a good candidate for selling options. This way traders can use the value to generate income without any out-of-pocket expenses.For example I can sell the January $35 put and collect $1.20 per contract. This way I don’t even need a rally to profit. If Micron stock stays above my level, then I win 100%. The worst-case scenario is that I own the shares and break even at $33.80 per share.Since the  is near all-time highs, taking any bullish position is risky enough from that perspective. So I make sure that I don’t take full positions at these levels. This way I leave room to add in case markets correct. And I never risk more than I can afford to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"loud computing has been a big win for investors over the past decade, and it's still a double-digit growth investment motif. In fact, according to researcher , global spending on centralized data centers and infrastructure will grow 17.5% to $214 billion in 2019 and will surpass $330 billion by 2022. And though growth of the cloud market shows no signs of letting up, a new related trend is only just beginning: the edge (not ""The Edge"" of U2 fame). Massive data centers deployed by the likes of , , and  provide enormous amounts of computing power for businesses. However, the rapid  in recent years, the rise of new processes like artificial intelligence, and the need for faster response times and real-time data monitoring have combined to create a demand for hubs that allow data to travel shorter distances. Thus, smaller localized data centers and technologies that allow for heavier lifting to be done at the device level are starting to emerge. This move from a centralized cloud to a dispersed one is picking up momentum. Estimates vary, but researchers have forecast this industry subset will grow by anywhere from around 20% to 50% every year over the next five years, with upper estimates pegging global spending on it in the $30 billion ballpark in a few years time. Research group Chetan Sharma Consulting thinks spending on the edge will eventually climb to the of dollars level in a few decades. Those are all arbitrary figures, but here's the point: Much of the cloud is being relocated closer to the end users, and with it, incredibly powerful computing power that will pave the way to new services and further industry transformation. Here's three ways and five companies to take advantage of the potential.First, there's the construction of these edge data centers themselves. The market for data center infrastructure equipment has long been dominated by , but  has been steadily chipping away at its lead for years. Not only is the company's hardware and suite of software management tools open source and designed to be custom-fitted to the needs of its clients, it's leading the charge with , and has launched a new campus networking segment -- private data centers built onsite or near an office or facility to handle local computing needs. It's a new segment for Arista, and there's a risk that the edge won't deliver as a solid growth catalyst for the company, given all of the other competitors out there selling network hardware. However, as CEO Jayshree Ullal pointed out on a , the cloud was a new business segment for Arista at one point, too. Now it's the company's bread-and-butter. With a lot of overlap between the cloud and edge computing hardware, I like Arista's chances at making this a profitable high-growth area in the years ahead.  is another hardware vendor that is picking up steam due to the edge and the technologies it supports. The chipmaker specializes in field programmable chips -- semiconductors that can be customized by a systems engineer as they are not pre-programmed for a specific task. Due to their flexibility, these chips can often be reused later for different tasks. The technology isn't new, but the advent of AI and other complex computing needs have boosted the demand for Xilinx's brand of silicon as of late. The company has also built software and other services atop its field programmable units to aid in the deployment of complex systems. As the burgeoning wave of edge computing spreads, hardware suppliers are a good place to start a search for investments, and both Arista Networks and Xilinx look likely to benefit in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images.After an edge facility is built, someone needs to manage it. Many data centers will be privately owned to support individual businesses'  operations, but not all of them.  is looking become an edge leader by pairing its ultra-fast 5G network based in dense urban centers -- which is in the  -- with its nation-spanning 4G network. Recent tests it has conducted demonstrate how the company will be able to offer ultra-fast connectivity for businesses with low latency (the time it takes data to travel between two locations), opening up new use cases for enterprise use and for Verizon's leading mobile network itself. Verizon isn't exactly a , but its move to the edge could help sustain its slow-and-steady pace, support a generous dividend that currently yields 4.3%, and further cement the wireless leader into the fabric of the internet. As the current leader in telecom here in the U.S., I like the company's chances at maintaining that lead by using 5G to offer edge computing for the masses.  Here's a less obvious potential beneficiary of the edge movement: , which has been beaten down and can't seem to turn things around. Its legacy consumer communications business is to blame for its current woes, as the cord-cutting trend continues, but management is looking for strategic alternatives elsewhere that could deliver growth, and in that effort, it's investing in  around the country. The company is beleaguered, but its fiber optic network has real value. Repurposing it for new connectivity uses that meet the demands of larger organizations looks like a winning strategy. CenturyLink has been announcing upgrades of its network geared toward businesses at a steady clip for some time, but this transition will require some patience. A turning point could likely come once it either sells off its ailing consumer services business or otherwise reorganizes it; regardless, its newer services catering to businesses need time to build momentum. In the meantime, this will be a  -- so plan accordingly.  There are a lot of other companies that could get a big boost from incorporating edge computing into their operations, and one article is not enough to cover them all. So instead, I'm picking Google parent . Though over 80% of Alphabet's revenues are derived from advertising, the tech giant has its hands in all sorts of cookie jars. And it is  from that highly lucrative ad business into a plethora of businesses like cloud computing,  and analytics, autonomous vehicles and logistics, and connected entertainment -- all of which could benefit from a healthy dose of faster, lower-latency computing. Investors may be worried that increased scrutiny from  will put a damper on Alphabet's prospects, but that in itself is a reason for the search and advertising leader to keep its foot on the gas when it comes to innovation. With many of its subsidiaries and strategic investments dependent on a faster internet and higher-level computing power, the edge could help accelerate the development of Alphabet's portfolio of new ventures and boost profits as they grow. This is a high-level overview of edge computing and the businesses that could benefit as a result of its development, so investors should do their own due diligence and research before buying any of the stocks mentioned.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. 	For the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (Symbol: VOOG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $177.95 per unit.


With VOOG trading at a recent price near $161.05 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.49% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.   Three of VOOG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Norfolk Southern Corp (Symbol: NSC), Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX), and Keysight Technologies Inc (Symbol: KEYS). Although NSC has traded at a recent price of $182.02/share, the average analyst target is 12.08% higher at $204.00/share. Similarly, XLNX has 11.96% upside from the recent share price of $110.18 if the average analyst target price of $123.36/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting KEYS to reach a target price of $98.00/share, which is 11.24% above the recent price of $88.10. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of NSC, XLNX, and KEYS:  

   Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

"I recently wrote about  (NASDAQ:) and suggested a bullish position. It paid over 20% in about two weeks. This was the case last time so clearly this one moves fast and in the right direction. Although my intent is slightly more long term, the short-term wins that AMD stock delivered are fantastic.Source: Shutterstock
	In mid-June, sellers had their way with the stock, but only to retest the neckline from which the bulls had recently broken out. This was all part of normal price action. Today, hold Advanced Micro Devices stock for the long term.Often when I get a profit that materializes too fast like this one I trim some if not all of it. But that is only because I am an active trader when dealing with momentum stocks like AMD. Those who prefer a hands-off approach need not worry about the short-term gyrations. The bet on this stock is up.We now rely on technology more than ever. It touches almost every aspect of our lives. Everything has tech in it, if not at the user interface then definitely behind the scenes. It takes judicious conscious effort to be truly unplugged.The demand on the products and services from companies like AMD is only going to increase. The barrier to entry is very high. It takes new technological breakthroughs to join the major tech companies in supplying this tech. So AMD will continue to thrive along with its competitors.The particular fundamentals vary largely among them. AMD stock price is not the cheapest. It sells at a three digit price-to-earnings ratio and 6 times sales. This is a P/E 10 times bigger than  (NASDAQ:) and four times bigger than  (NASDAQ:).From an investment perspective, you get what you pay for. AMD stock has out-performed all its competitors by a long shot. Last year, when the whole stock market was falling off a cliff, AMD was up 50%. This year AMD is up 91% and 146% in two years. This stock continues to lead and investors should stick with it.Recently the technology sector stocks, especially chip suppliers, were hit hard as the headlines surrounding Huawei flew. They are directly impacted by what happens there. But these are temporary because politicians are using businesses as leverage in their negotiations.The U.S. and China are still in an economic head-butting war that has dragged on long enough that it will eventually lose its headline effect. Eventually AMD stock price will stop being a political football and will continue to trade on its own merit.In June the short-term support levels held. This is a cluster around $29 per share and I expect that to continue unless the markets in general correct sharply this year. Conversely, the upside trigger still looms above near $34.40 per share.For the long term investors, there is no need for action. For the shorter-term momentum traders, it is best to chase a breach of either side of the trigger zones noted. A good way to trade AMD stock for the past two years has been to simply buy the dips. So far the stock has not disappointed.The odds stack up against the AMD bears. In June they had a lot going for them and they failed to keep the stock down. Headlines and seasonality gave the edge to the sellers and they ran out of steam. Credit goes to the AMD management team under the leadership of Lisa Su that has gained the respect of Wall Street investors.In my last write-up I also noted the opportunity to create income out of thin air by selling the AMD October $26 put. That trade has yielded $1.50 with nothing out of pocket. I can repeat the process now by selling the January $27 per share and collect $1.80 per share. If AMD stock price stays above my strike I win completely. Else I would own the shares at $27 per share and break even at $25.20.The S&P 500 is still at all time highs so the odds of a dip increase at these altitudes. This makes all bullish entries into stocks, even good ones like AMD, carry a little more risk than normal. So I keep my sizing to half size so I leave room for risk management.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

he semiconductor industry has been hit particularly hard by the U.S.-China trade war. With a significant amount of the manufacturing process headed up in the east, but headquarters mostly based in the California Bay Area, chipmakers have been hit with a volley of body blows: cross-border tariffs, a Chinese economic slowdown, and a White House crackdown on Chinese telecom equipment manufacturers  and .Despite the significant disruption,  has continued to shine. The programmable chipmaker is benefiting from multiple secular tailwinds blowing strong at its back and helping it plow through the treacherous waters of international trade. After the company's fiscal 2020 first-quarter report (the three months ended June 29, 2019), the stock still looks like a best-in-show pick.Granted, Xilinx's last quarterly performance wasn't perfect. Sales to Huawei were suspended during the middle of the quarter to comply with the trade ban, and a digital memory customer started going through a product transition. That slowed down the top-line rate of growth and put pressure on gross profit margin on product sold.YOY = year over year. Pp = percentage point. Data source: Xilinx. At the end of the day, though, Xilinx has a lot going for it. Some shipments of older chips to Huawei resumed -- as they did for other American chip makers like  -- toward the end of the quarter, but Huawei simply isn't so important as to completely derail Xilinx. There are other wireless infrastructure providers out there as  start to slowly roll out, and Xilinx's semiconductors are a key component for all of them. When adding in the company's other growth stories in the automotive space, data centers, and anywhere artificial intelligence can be applied, there is more than enough to keep the upward trajectory easily intact. Image source: Getty Images.But what about the guidance for next quarter? Xilinx did call for revenue of $800 million to $850 million -- flat at best with Q1 and up just 7% to 14% year over year. Operating expenses are also expected to be up 16% year over year, which should keep downward pressure on earnings growth. Thus, this semiconductor manufacturer isn't completely immune to the trade war, and a resolution to the dispute and an ease-up on Huawei would certainly be welcome. Shareholders can nevertheless take solace in the fact that, even in the face of geopolitical unrest, Xilinx can still muster better-than-par performance where so many others are reporting declines in business. That speaks to the company's technology, with its chips a key component in artificial intelligence and other advanced computing networks. Still, it is worth noting that continued high-octane growth is priced in. The stock is valued at 27.6 times trailing 12-month free cash flow (what's left over after operating and capital expenditures are paid), and one-year forward price-to-earnings estimates also put shares at 27.6. Not exactly a value investor's dream. However, Xilinx has demonstrated its ability to turn sales growth into even faster profit growth, and a share repurchase program (over $316 million worth of stock was bought last quarter alone) and a 1.2% annual dividend yield sweeten the deal. Trade war or not, this semiconductor stock is worth a serious look. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them!

"[Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article featured Cypress Semiconductor, which has been removed.]Last year saw chip stocks swoon. There was the beginning of the trade war with China and all the unknowns it brought about.Remember, the one thing the market hates more than anything is uncertainty. And living with the uncertainty of how this powerful industry was going to navigate an all-out – or even partial – trade war was on everyone’s mind.Add to that the fact the tax cut in  was starting to wear off and global economies weren’t expanding as quickly as hoped. This meant spending was going to slow. And that meant semiconductor stocks may well be starting their downward cycle.Smaller firms were spared initially, as the big semi firms took the brunt of it. But then the sector suffered.This year is entirely different. The  has returned a whopping 43.8% year to date, more than doubling the ’s 21%.Even the  won’t slow them down now. Below are seven semiconductor stocks to buy to satisfy your inner geek and your growth portfolio.Source: Shutterstock
	 (NASDAQ:) looked like a goner a couple years ago.It was competing in two sectors that put it up against the biggest chipmakers out there, plus it was living on scraps from  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) in both the CPU and GPU markets.As the market began to transform with AI, cloud, and IoT gaining momentum, AMD looked like it was a bit lost. It still made quality products, but was struggling to keep up. Lisa Su took over in 2015 and started to make changes, it was just a question of whether she could make them before it was too late.It’s safe to say now, she has.AMD stock is making a comeback and competing again. It has also been beating earnings on a regular basis. AMD stock is up 90% year to date and is likely to beat earnings again on 30 July. All of these factors make AMD a key semiconductor stock to buy. (NASDAQ:) isn’t technically a semiconductor stock, but it falls into the category since its niche doesn’t really fit better anywhere else. At any rate, it’s a great stock to buy.ENPH has become the leading builder of microinverter systems for the solar photovoltaic industry.Basically, when you get energy from solar panels (or most renewables), the electricity is DC (direct current). But the grid, residences, and offices operate on AC (alternating current).You have to convert that DC power to AC to make it useful. That’s what inverters do.Prices are coming down as more solar is being deployed. ENPH is getting a lot of that new business.The stock is up a whopping 324% year to date and this train just started running. (NASDAQ:) is a small analog-to-digital chip maker company in a very high-growth space. Unfortunately, the trade war with China has hamstrung its ability to keep its rapid growth going.IPHI stock has bounced around the past few years but is really coming into its own over the past year. The stock is up 85% in the past year and 92% year to date. Its chips are focused in the server, communications and cloud sectors.Like all chip stocks, IPHI took a hit last year when the trade war started because it had big clients in China. The market for its products was growing quickly there as Chinese tech spread across Asia.But most analysts were bullish even after weak Q1 results this year. And that bullishness remains in place, especially now that the U.S. and China negotiating teams will be sitting back down in Shanghai on July 30.Source: Shutterstock
	 (NASDAQ:) is back to focusing on its core technology – field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These are semiconductors that have become very popular products for a variety of industries.For a while, LSCC was trying to diversify its product lines into various sectors of the tech space, which wasn’t getting much traction. LSCC is now back to focusing on its core business.That’s why over the past two years the stock flat-lined for the most part, until 2019 began.Another big part of it was the fact that LSCC has had historically close ties to the Chinese market, so the trade war was a big factor in its performance. But again, uncertainty was more the issue.By January, the trade war fallout was clear and resetting expectations boosted LSCC. The stock is up 145% year to date and looks well positioned to get moving again as the U.S. relents on tech tariffs and China swoops in while the window is open. It’s a stock to buy.(NASDAQ:) is one of the few stocks to buy on this list that isn’t rallying like crazy.The reason? One of its top customers happens to be , the massive Chinese telecom company. It announced earlier this week that Q2 revenue was going to come in under analysts’ expectation due to the trade embargo on sales to Huawei.But there’s no real reason to be alarmed. This company has a $30 billion market cap, is up 44% year to date, and sells at a trailing PE of 35.XLNX is a leading chipmaker in two of the hottest sectors right now: 5G telecom and data centers.There’s little doubt that XLNX will continue to grow and maintain its position in lead-edge technologies. It might not be growing as quickly as smaller firms in the sector, but it’s a solid, world-class player with a very bright future.Source: 
	 (NASDAQ:) is what’s known as a  chipmaker, which essentially means it outsources production of its silicon wafers. From here, things get pretty technical (read: “geeky”), as its production slate includes codecs for analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converters, smart codecs, boosted amplifiers and haptic drivers, among other integrated circuits (IC). Chances are these ICs are used in your laptop, smartwatch or even your virtual reality (VR) headset, especially if your device is an iPhone.Cirrus Logic’s stock has outperformed in 2019, rising 41% year-to-date. The performance of CRUS is closely tied to sentiment around (NASDAQ:), up 30%-plus. As demand for iPhones increase, as does Cirrus shares. Some see weakness in Cirrus Logic’s lack of diversification, but if you’re going to be tied down, there’s not many companies that are better to be tied to than Apple.Analysts tend to agree. With three buy ratings, two holds and one sell, the consensus is for CRUS stock to hit $51 over the next 12-months. Compared to its 40% rise this year, 5% is a drop in the bucket. But it’s worth holding onto CRUS stock and buying on any dips as we head into a new iPhone cycle.Source: Shutterstock
	 (NASDAQ:) is an Israel-based chip firm that also produces a number of interconnect and switch systems.Its fundamental purpose is to build support systems that facilitate data transmission between servers, storage systems, telecom and other embedded equipment. This is a very important bridge technology that allows all the tech on one side to get its information to the other side.In March, NVDA announced it was buying MLNX for $6.9 billion. INTC had tried to buy it in January but was rebuffed. Other suitors included  (NASDAQ:) and XLNX. It’s a very sought-after company.While the company sells for around $113 a share, that doesn’t exactly equate to where the stock will eventually land.At this point, MLNX is a stock to buy and an interesting way to buy into NVDA. This is a key player in a very important sector of tech moving forward.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek@2019-07-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-for-your-inner-geek-2019-07-26

LogMeIn Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.325 on 8/23/19, Intel Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.315 on 9/1/19, and Xilinx, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.37 on 8/27/19.  

As a percentage of LOGM's recent stock price of $74.12, this dividend works out to approximately 0.44%, so look for shares of LogMeIn Inc to trade 0.44% lower — all else being equal — when LOGM shares open for trading on 8/6/19.  Similarly, investors should look for INTC to open 0.65% lower in price and for XLNX to open 0.33% lower, all else being equal.

"emiconductor provider   reported its fiscal first-quarter results after the market closed on July 24. Both revenue and earnings grew by more than 20%, despite weak demand from data center customers. Growth will slow way down in the second quarter, because of the loss of revenue from Huawei as well as general economic uncertainty. Here's what investors need to know.Data source: Xilinx.Image source: Xilinx.During the , Xilinx CEO Victor Peng talked about Huawei and the company's 5G business:Despite our complete suspension of shipments to Huawei in the middle of the quarter, we saw continued strong demand at many of our wired and wireless customers in support of global 5G deployments. We remain well positioned during this initial wave of the 5G cycle, which we continue to believe will be factors larger than the 4G cycle.Peng also explained why the data center business suffered during the first quarter:Our business did not grow as expected, largely due to the suspension of shipments to Huawei for their [function-as-a-service] deployment, as well as the slowdown in orders due to a product transition at a significant memory customer, the latter of which we expect to meaningfully recover next quarter.Peng also discussed the rationale behind the acquisition of NGCodec:We announced the acquisition of NGCodec that adds a differentiated video compression software to our portfolio to support our Data Center Group. This product has already gained traction with key cloud customers, including Twitch and Alibaba. Video acceleration will be one of the key growth drivers for the DCG business.Xilinx provided the following guidance for the second quarter:Xilinx's guidance reflects a full quarter of shipping restrictions to Huawei, as well as trade-related uncertainty. It does include an estimate of revenue from the resumption of shipments of certain permissible products to Huawei.

 (NASDAQ: ) is a semiconductor company that has stayed competitive and thrived in this rough-and-tumble sector since 1984.   Today, its client list hosts many big names in a variety of industries.XLNX started the year strong and nearly doubled its July 2018 price by May. But then the next round of the Chinese trade war happened. That took tech stocks down sharply.Wall Street doesn’t like uncertainty. Not knowing they could sell chips to Chinese firms like  and others created a lot of uncertainty. What’s more, these are growth stocks. When one of the largest markets in the world is taken off your business list, it has significant implications.Planning around something like that is difficult. It’s like rigging a ship for a hurricane but not knowing if the storm is going to be a glancing blow or a direct hit. Your contingency plans will slow you down regardless of the outcome.So, the market adjusted its expectations. And by June, it looked to be clear sailing, at least for a little while, as the Trump administration allowed some chip sales to China and both countries went back to the negotiating table.That doesn’t mean there’s no threat, but the sector is back under full sail.For XLNX in particular, this has helped revive its performance. In the past year, the XLNX stock is up 86%; year-to-date the stock is up 50%. What’s more, the trailing PE on the stock is sitting around 36, so it’s not even fully valued here, giving it plenty of headroom.And given the fact that it could be back on its growth path soon, that growth could come fast, especially as other sectors begin to tire in this environment.Moving forward, XLNX is a key player in very high-growth, strategically oriented sectors.In telecom, XLNX is key supplier Apple () and there is a lot of buzz that its new generation of iPhones may revive its tiring line.In the data center world – cloud computing, big data, data warehouses, etc. – its strength with  (),  () and  () means it will be at the center of this massive and ongoing trend.

  shareholders have largely been a happy lot this year. The stock has delivered terrific gains as the construction of  (5G) wireless networks has . And that catalyst is just beginning to deliver for the company: The pace of the deployment of 5G infrastructure is set to increase in the coming months and years.But there's a thorn in the side of Xilinx that has punished its stock of late -- the U.S.-China trade war.Image Source: Getty ImagesXilinx's rapid financial growth could come to a halt if the trade war between the U.S. and China doesn't end soon.Reuters reported last month that Xilinx has been lobbying the U.S. government to relax its ban on sales to Huawei so that it can sell its products to the beleaguered Chinese giant. Its interest isn't surprising, as Huawei has won half of the 5G network contracts issued by , that country's largest telecom operator. (Rivals  and  scored 34% and 12% of China's 5G tender, respectively.)Huawei was placed on the U.S. government's Entity List due to allegations that the company engaged in actions that threaten U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. As a result, any  domestic company that wants to sell and export technology to it must obtain a license for the deal from Commerce Department.Chinese telecoms are expected to invest $58 billion in 5G networks over the next couple of years, according to GSMA Intelligence, and Huawei looks well placed to receive a good chunk of that spending. What's more, it reportedly commands 29% of the global telecom equipment market. An inability to supply chips to such a big player will definitely harm Xilinx.The chances of the U.S. and China resolving their trade dispute may be looking up, but even if there isn't a quick deal that allows Xilinx to revive its relationship with Huawei, investors shouldn't lose faith, because there's more to the 5G market than China.For instance,  plans to bring 5G service to 30 cities in 2019, while  plans to roll out its network in 22. Telecom operators in South Korea have already taken the lead in deploying 5G networks,  in the process. In all, IDC estimates that investments in 5G infrastructure will balloon to $26 billion in the next three years, as compared to $528 million in 2018.Xilinx's early moves into this space positioned it to take advantage of the 5G market's secular growth. That's because the chipmaker's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are helping telecom companies in the  of 5G networks, and the company is confident of sustaining this momentum even after custom chips hit the market.Xilinx has strengthened its 5G product portfolio by launching  that can replace several components made by other chipmakers, resulting in improved efficiency for the end user and stickier design wins for the chipmaker. Specifically, Xilinx's combo chips integrate digital processors, analog chips, and the embedded software design into a single platform, which makes them attractive for any telecom looking to build a 5G network.And the company is more than just a 5G play. While the cellular tech has played a critical role in its growth of late, investors shouldn't ignore its opportunities in other areas such as  and .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

	Is the new AMD chipset  as Nvidia’s ?  Are the new Nvidia boards  for gamers at all?All this is of great interest to gamers like my son, who asked all weekend whether he should plunk for a new graphics engine on his 3-year-old PC. It may even stimulate near-term volatility and But if you’re a long-term investor and see strength 10 years ahead of you instead of infirmity, this is not where the game is. The game for you is artificial intelligence. It’s in the clouds and new devices we can barely imagine today.That’s the game Nvidia aims to win.Nvidia has been focused on the cloud market in recent years, specifically in general purpose chips that accelerate the work of clouds. They dominates that market the way  (NASDAQ:) .Rivals are hiding in niches, trying to turn what had been field-programmable gate arrays (FGPAs) into competition for general purpose Nvidia chips. (NASDAQ:), Intel and AMD are all doing similar things. But Nvidia still has the most complete solution for cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI). That will become more apparent once its acquisition of  (NASDAQ:), whose “networking fabric” delivers optical speeds within data centers, is complete.Nvidia’s recent construction of its own AI computer, dubbed , demonstrated just how big its data center ambitions are.Nvidia’s competition won’t come from other chipmakers but from the cloud giants themselves.  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:) and (NASDAQ:) are all working on AI chip sets for their clouds, knowing that keeping costs down on scaled infrastructure is still their key to success.To win them over Nvidia is demonstrating inference chips with , while commercial chips are running with four or eight processors. Nvidia’s processor is like a cloud on a chip.None of this is cheap. Nvidia’s research budget last year came to nearly $2.4 billion, one-third more than the previous year. That’s twice as much as it spends on selling and general administration, over one-third of total operating spending. But if it keeps Nvidia ahead of its customers, it’s money well-spent.There’s a common misperception among investors that everything falls in a recession.It’s not true. Throughout this century technology has recovered ahead of the general economy. Technology that can cut costs, not just create new markets, has done especially well.That’s where Nvidia expects to win. Replacing labor, even intellectual labor, with machines boosts productivity once customers realize they must either innovate or die. It eliminated middle managers in the 2000s, insurance salesmen in the 2010s, and is bound to eliminate millions of drivers and machine operators in the next decade.What will be left will be the value those jobs provided. Deliveries will still reach you, just as you can still buy insurance and run a scaled enterprise. A recession that other companies anticipate with dread, Nvidia approaches with hope.Nvidia’s 0.39% dividend yield is not the reason you buy the stock. Income investors should look elsewhere.Nvidia’s short-term growth prospects are also poor. It brought in $2.22 billion during the first quarter of its 2020 fiscal year. It’s expected to bring in just $2.55 billion this quarter, which .

"Yesterday,  (NYSE:) reported earnings and the reaction was positive. In fact, MU stock is up over 15%. This provided positive sympathy moves across the whole semiconductor sector, helping chip stocks like  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:).The tech sector tends to trade in unison, but the semiconductor bunch is even tighter. A move in one ripples across all the rest.Year to date, all three chip stocks in focus are strong performers. Xilinx stock is the leader of the bunch, up 32%. (Still only half as much as  (NASDAQ:), however.) The other two are still outperforming the , so they are all winners. For reference, the  (NYSEARCA:) is up 25% YTD.Today, I discuss the opportunity that lies in XLNX, WDC and MU stocks for this year and next. These are great companies that have recently had several bouts of negative headlines stemming from the trade war.The upside effect of going through sharp corrections like this is that they leave important lines behind that become opportunities on the rebound. XLNX, WDC and MU have such lines that will serve as short term triggers but with potential long term bullish effect.It won’t be easy because these are also areas of resistance along the way. Furthermore, we still have geopolitical challenges, but the world needs tech too badly for the powers-that-be not to find a work-around the current restrictions.This weekend, during the G20 meetings, Presidents Trump and Xi will meet. No, I don’t expect a deal, but I think they will announce that they brought the talks back on track. This will be the equivalent of kicking the can a few weeks or months long enough to allow the rally in chips stocks to continue.So far these three chip stocks are outperforming the benchmark and I expect them to continue to do that. They are definitely stocks to buy for this year and the next.Source: Shutterstock
	Xilinx is a strong company with a great reputation. For the last 8 months, it has been a freak of nature stock. While the stock markets are still trying to recover from the crash last fall, XLNX is up 50% from that ledge and 66% off the November low. At its highest it was up 105% off the lows.Clearly Wall Street loves Xilinx stock so it’s natural to see it carry a high valuation. XLNX’s trailing P/E ratio is 32, which is almost ten times more than that of Micron. So XLNX is not a bargain — but it’s still 60% cheaper than WDC. But even if it were the most expensive chip stock, you get what you pay for and XLNX has rewarded its share owners handsomely. So from that sense, value is not a deterring factor here.Technically, between $115 and $116 per share is a neckline that if the bulls can breach they can trigger a bullish pattern that would target $126 or higher. At that point, it would come pretty close to filling the open gap to $136 that happened after XLNX’s last earnings report.This won’t be easy. There will be resistances at $119.50, $122 and $126.8. I consider this more of a tactical opportunity than an investment because the goal is to ride a technical wave to a measured target. So I would set tight stops below at $105.50, $104.30 or $98 depending on your risk appetite.Source: Shutterstock
	While this year WDC stock is performing well, it is far from its highs. Five years ago it was $114 per share and now it’s under $50. Clearly, it has been systematically out of favor on Wall Street. Today’s opportunity is one that not expect it to recover those all-time high levels, but rather one that suggests mid-term profits.While Western Digital stock is up big off the December lows, it’s still lagging the indices in a big way. WDC is barely halfway back to the October ledge from which it crashed last year. But if the bulls can overcome $46 per share, they can invite more momentum buyers to get back to $54. This won’t be easy because there are resistance levels along the way especially around $48.50, but with the help of the rest of the sector they can do it.The zone just above the WDC stock price now has been pivotal of late. So the bulls have their work cut out for them here. But if they are successful then the reward is a rally back up to $64 per share, which was the ledge from last August.Given the technical aspect of this thesis I consider this to also be a tactical setup especially that the overall trend of WDC stock has been long term negative. Also the valuation is so high here that I can’t justify owning it for that reason either.Source: Shutterstock
	MU is a cheap stock, especially for a chip stock. It sells at a 3.5 trailing P/E ratio. From that perspective, I consider this a fundamental trade since I am betting on value to profit. But the experts would always note that Micron stock is a value trap. Cheap can get cheaper is the ongoing meme on MU.Therein lies my opportunity for MU stock today. I have had the best luck trading it with options and by selling puts into what others fear. I leverage the fact that it is cheap and challenge the prevailing meme.This method suits my personality well because I don’t like to chase a runaway stock — especially one that doesn’t have the reputation of being a momentum stock. Micron rallies don’t get the same fans as say AMD.Consensus is that the fundamentals in MU are terrible because it’s tied to DRAM which has become a commodity. So it’s always subject to the challenges of maintaining perfect inventory levels and pricing. To that the Micron CEO confirmed that they are managing this into next year and that they are confident that they can succeed.While this is comforting to know, it’s definitely not a ringing endorsement to chase upside performance in MU stock. But it does create an opportunity to create income without any out of pocket expense.I can do this by selling the MU October $30 put and collect $1.20 per contract. All I need to win is for Micron stock to stay above it through mid October. Else I own the shares at that price and break even at $28.80. So this method leaves me a 19% buffer between current price and my level of risk.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

"  is coming off a solid first half of 2019. The chipmaker saw  in the first six months of the year after investors were left unimpressed by what looked like a solid quarterly report nearly three months ago.But Xilinx has managed to make  thanks to a notable product launch, and investors will be hoping that the stock steps on the gas when the company delivers its fiscal 2020 first-quarter earnings report next week.Image source: Getty Images.The U.S.-China trade war has cast a cloud of uncertainty over Xilinx of late. The company announced toward the end of May that it had stopped sales of chips to Huawei after the Department of Commerce issued a denial order against the Chinese corporation.This could weigh on Xilinx's upcoming results, though the extent of the damage might not be alarming. Xilinx reportedly gets just 1.8% of its revenue from Huawei, according to Bloomberg estimates.Investors should also note that, unlike some of its semiconductor peers, Xilinx hasn't cut its first-quarter outlook. So there's a good chance that the company's results will be in line with its guidance at the beginning of the fiscal year.However, investors will be paying closer attention to Xilinx's outlook, as Huawei could have played a key role in driving the company's fifth-generation (5G) wireless business higher this year. This is because Huawei has reportedly won half of the 5G tenders issued by the country's largest telecom operator, .So Huawei could have been a crucial catalyst for Xilinx's top line this year. The chipmaker is expecting revenue between $3.45 billion and $3.6 billion for the full year, which is better than what analysts were originally forecasting. At the midpoint of that guidance, Xilinx's revenue stands to increase nearly 15% year over year.The Huawei catalyst could prompt Xilinx to issue a better-than-expected outlook, boosting investor confidence. But if Xilinx's results or outlook don't sizzle, the stock could take a knock given its rapid rise in recent months and its lofty valuation. However, savvy investors should be looking to take advantage of such a situation thanks to the multiple catalysts Xilinx enjoys.Despite the short-term headwinds, Xilinx investors shouldn't take their eyes off the long-term opportunities the company has.The company leads the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) market with over half of the market share in its pocket, and it looks all set to  in the space. Xilinx recently started shipping its Versal adaptive compute acceleration program (ACAP) chips based on the 7-nanometer lithography process.Xilinx claims that Versal is capable of achieving ""dramatic performance improvements of up to 20X over today's fastest FPGA implementations and over 100X over today's fastest CPU implementations -- for Data Center, wired network, 5G wireless, and automotive driver assist applications."" As a result, this chip could witness solid demand because it can be applied across a host of applications, such as data centers and automotive -- two areas where the deployment of FPGAs .Within the data center space, demand for the type of programmable chips that Xilinx sells is expected to increase at an annual rate of 67% over the next four years, as the market reaches $4.6 billion, according to IHS Markit.Xilinx's FPGAs are in strong demand from the automotive sector as well. The segment grew in the double digits last year thanks to the company's partnerships with  that have been tapping the chipmaker for powering their advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).The market for ADAS systems is expected to attain an annual growth rate of 19% through 2025. Xilinx will have a better opportunity to tap into this market with the Versal chip.There's a chance that Xilinx issues a better-than-anticipated guidance thanks to the strength of its product development moves. But even if that doesn't happen next week and the stock takes a beating, it would be a good idea to focus on the long-term opportunities and add more shares of Xilinx.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

	Because of what’s going on between the United States and China, the tech sector and specifically the chip manufacturers have been in and out of favor on Wall Street of late. The economic war that is still lingers from last year and now focus is now on Huawei.Since politicians prefer doing their negotiations through headlines, stocks like AMD,  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) suffer the consequences of the political rhetoric between the two countries. (NASDAQ:) recent earnings was the latest tangible result and it was not good. They raised a big alarm warning of tremendous negative impact on their business. Investors then indiscriminately extrapolated those risks onto the rest of the sector. Traders got a real taste of the impact that this economic struggle has had on the bottom line. So to say the least, there is uncertainty in the chip sector going into next quarter.The point of today’s note is that some company stocks will be fine. AMD is one that should retain its incredible momentum. It is up 60% year-to-date date, up 90% in one year, and up 585% in five years. Clearly investors love the stock and they will continue buying the dips in it.But it won’t all be good days. It is important to note that for the next few days, there is a bearish setup in AMD stock. In spite of support below $29, the AMD sellers could retest $26 per share. The range since April has tightened so there is tension building in the stock. So the next burst in the stock is important but won’t change the overall direction. Meaning the bulls are still in control of AMD stock.AMD is not cheap. So if someone is short AMD, they’re not compelled to cover their positions until the stock rebounds above $31 per share. But if the equity markets continue to rally as it has been then shorting AMD alone is reckless because there is no reason for it to fall alone.Expensive or not, investors — as opposed to traders — are interested in buying AMD  for at least five years, so they are not sell now. Thus, the AMD bears need a new thesis to continue sustain their selling efforts in the face of this adoration.Its competitors like  (NASDAQ:) and Intel are definitely cheaper but they have not been as good a stock to own as AMD. So I guess in a sense one could argue that you get what you pay for. AMD management continues to execute well on plans so the AMD stock should continue to climb the wall of worry as it has been.Before the October correction, AMD stock hit $34 per share before it failed. Then recently it also failed again from exactly the same level. This will start the chatter about double tops. Those short the stock drool over the possibility of another debacle like what happened late last year. But this time it is different because the Fed is working with the stock market ready to prop things if business worsens.So even if the AMD selling continues I don’t expect it to go as deep as last November. We are going into another earnings season, and I expect that management will again deliver strong enough results to support the stock. There is major support at $28, $26 $24 and $22 per share. So the bulls have several layers to help them build the base for more upside.Seasonality suggests that the overall markets usually suffer the week after the June options expire. So the bears have a window of opportunity for the next few days going into the G20 meetings in Osaka. But if good things come out of that meeting, even if they just kick the can down the road on resolving the issues between the United States and China, markets will rally. Then the bears window of opportunity closes fast.With the lack of new bad news, the market will rally and so will Advanced Micro Devices stock.In summary, AMD is a winning stock without an intrinsic reason to stop. Their products and services are in high demand and so is their stock on Wall Street. Furthermore the bulls can afford to lose a few fights below current levels on the charts and still come out ahead. The double-talk rhetoric will fail as long as the overall markets rally for the next couple of weeks. If I’m short AMD I would at least trim my position. If I’m looking to go long AMD anywhere close to $28 per share to the decent place a reload.For those who like to use options and want to get a cheap entry into AMD stock, I can sell the October $26 put and collect about $2 per contract. So if the stock falls below it then I own the shares and break even to $24. If not, I am already long the stock with a 20% buffer from current price.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

"Image source: The Motley Fool. Q1 2020 , Good afternoon. My name is Catherine, and I'll be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Q1 FY '20 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, Catherine, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and a business outlook for the September quarter.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents that the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.In addition to GAAP financial measures, we will be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions.We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website.Please note that we have also posted a document to our IR website that contains flat quarter historical data for the new end-market classification we adopted in May 2019. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share our results today as they exemplify the durability and resilience of our business. We saw solid growth in our WWG, AIT and ABC end markets, which enabled us to achieve the midpoint of our Q1 fiscal 2020 revenue guidance despite unexpected challenges.I'm proud of the tremendous effort by our employees to achieve our target despite the Huawei shipping restrictions, which occurred midway through the quarter, as well as the general uncertainty in the current global trade environment.Now, let me share some highlights around our business units in core vertical markets. I'll start with WWG. Despite our complete suspension of shipments to Huawei in the middle of the quarter, we saw continued strong demand at many of our wired and wireless customers in support of global 5G deployments. We remain well positioned during this initial wave of the 5G cycle, which we continue to believe will be factors larger than the 4G cycle.Following the deployments in South Korea last year, we are seeing the beginning of deployments in China, albeit or measured given the Huawei action. We are actively ramping sales of products supporting radio applications in addition to baseband.As we noted in our Analyst and Investor Day, we anticipate a mix shift to radios as a portion of our baseband revenues converts to ASICs. We've been monitoring the market closely and to date, have not seen unusual inventory building at wireless customers, but we will, of course, continue to watch it very closely.Moving to DCG. Our business did not grow as expected, largely due to the suspension of shipments to Huawei for their FaaS deployment, as well as the slowdown in orders due to a product transition at a significant memory customer, the latter of which we expect to meaningfully recover next quarter.That said, we continue to make good progress with multiple hyperscalers, both on FaaS and internal acceleration applications. Our hyperscaler customers have begun deploying our platforms in production for accelerating applications such as search, streaming video, as well as network acceleration with SmartNICAlveo continues to make progress with numerous proof-of-concept or POCs with end customers, top-tier OEMsWe are anticipating revenue contribution to be meaningful later this fiscal year as those customers move those POCs into production. Lorenzo will be sharing additional details regarding our core vertical markets later in the call.So now, I'm going to turn over to other highlights in the quarter. Revenue from advanced products grew 53% year-over-year and was 69% of total sales in Q1. We saw broad-based demand for our 16-nanometer UltraScale Plus family, which continues to be a stronger revenue driver for our business.Last year, we introduced an extension to that family with industry leading 58 gig PAM4 SERDES. These products enable customers in the wired, TME and A&D markets to double the bandwidth of existing 25 gig systems without deploying new infrastructure.Our new Virtex UltraScale Plus 58-gig devices will be shipping in production soon. In addition, based on our strong customer demand, we extended our Virtex UltraScale Plus high bandwidth memory or HBM family by adding 16 gigabyte HBM capacity to that familyThese high-capacity HBM products are ideally suited for workloads that process large datasets such as adaptable AI Inference, database acceleration, data analytics, video transcoding and security processing. The 4-gigabyte and 8-gigabyte products are already in production, and we're sampling the 16-gigabyte products today. The 16-gigabyte products will go into production later this year.Demand for our Zynq platform remained strong, driven by the adoption of our MPSoC family in wireless and across our core vertical markets. Revenues from our Zynq family grew 68% year-over-year, which represented approximately 23% of total revenue in Q1.In fact, cumulative revenue from our 28-nanometer Zynq product has crossed the $1 billion mark. We see our 60-nanometer Zynq products growing at an even faster pace. In terms of our progress in Q1, with our adaptive computing strategy, we started sampling first 7-nanometer Versal AI Core and Versal Prime series product to select customers.We will be expanding our early access customer engagements throughout this quarter, Q2. Our Versal Silicon testing to date indicates that we're solidly on track to deliver 10x increase in performance and significant power efficiency gains for a number of applications compared to the latest generation FPGAs and general-purpose processors. We'll be showcasing our Versal platforms in a new unified software development environment that will greatly enhance the user experience at our XDF this October. I hope to see many of you there.Now shifting to M&A activities. We announced the acquisition of NGCodec that adds a differentiated video compression software to our portfolio to support our Data Center Group. This product has already gained traction with key cloud customers, including Twitch and Alibaba.Video acceleration will be one of the key growth drivers for the DCG business. We're also on track to close the acquisition of Solarflare in Q2. Recall that this acquisition brings a new class of SmartNIC, the hyperscalers, HCC, enterprise and telco networking customers. These new SmartNICs will eliminate network bandwidth bottlenecks, free up CPU cycles, enable network and data center computing, as well as customizations for unique customer needs.Now before I hand off to Lorenzo for a detailed review of our Q1 financials and our Q2, I want to provide some additional comments related to Huawei. Xilinx is committed to ensuring full compliance with all US export control regulations. As such upon the Commerce Department's addition of Huawei and its non-US affiliates to the Bureau of Industry and Security Entity List in mid-May, Xilinx immediately suspended shipments of all products to HuaweiThen, after a review of the Export Administration Regulations and Entity List restrictions, we determine that we could lawfully resume shipping select products. We have recently begun fulfilling orders from Huawei during our current quarter. These products are mostly 28-nanometer or older products and are not designed into 5G applications. We have also submitted request to the Commerce Department for licenses to sell additional products to Huawei.Xilinx will continue to comply with all government and legal requirements across our global operations. I want to emphasize that we cannot predict whether additional government actions may further impact our ability to ship Huawei as the situation remains dynamic. We hope a resolution to these issues that led to US and China trade actions is reached as quickly as possible, so market-driven trade can resume.In conclusion, we are focused on executing to our strategy and remain very confident in our significant and unique long-term growth opportunities, driven by 5G, data center and automotive disruptions and our transformation to platforms.Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Lorenzo. -- Yes. Thank you, Victor.Overall, our business performed quite well this quarter, even with the challenges Victor just described. Total revenue was in line with guidance at $850 million, up 24% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Our results are a testament to the resilience of our revenue base from our broad set of end markets and diverse customer set.The continued 5G build-out drove the growth in Wired and Wireless Group, with revenue expanding 66% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, wireless declined slightly and wired grew. Our broad customer base drove this growth in the quarter, although less than expected due to the Huawei shipping restriction.Revenue from the Data Center Group was below our guidance, declining 13% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter. We showed growth in multiple hyperscalers and broader accounts, but the Huawei ban did have an effect on DCG. In addition, one of our memory-related customers is going through a product transition and had an inventory-related slowdown.In AIT, all end markets outperformed expectations with strength in industrial and less than anticipated declines in aerospace and defense and TME. AIT grew 10% year-over-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. In the quarter, A&D, Industrial and TME were broadly strong and we had a modest amount of accelerated orders by some industrial customers.In ABC, we continue our long-term growth trend with 10% year-over-year growth. Quarter-to-quarter, we grew 8%, so we were weaker than expected in auto. The auto decline was due primarily to slower auto sales in China, stemming from trade-related factors. Broadcast and consumer were stronger than expected in the quarter. Gross margin was in line with guidance, with GAAP margin of 66.2% and non-GAAP gross margin of 66.6%. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is due to M&A-related amortization.Operating expense with GAAP OpEx at $312 million and non-GAAP at $306 million was slightly lower than our guidance. GAAP operating income was $251 million or 29.5% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $260 million or 30.6% operating margins, better than expected as gross margin was slightly higher and operating expense was slightly lowerOur GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately 8%. One detailed note here. Some of you may be aware of the Alterra case related to the tax impact of share-based expenses and cost-sharing agreement. We have not recognized any impact on our tax rate from the recent Ninth Circuit Court decision as we view this matter is unsettled. Please refer to our 10-Q for more disclosure.GAAP net income was $241 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.94. GAAP EPS grew 27% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $249 million, yielding a record non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.97 a share, a 29% growth over last year. Diluted share count decreased slightly to 258 million share.Next, I'll cover a few points on the balance sheet and cash flow. Gross cash was $2.9 billion with $1.2 billion in long-term debt. Accounts receivable declined to $306 million and is at 33 days. Inventory increased $21 million to $337 million as we build for future demand, particularly in 16 nanometer.Overall, we generated $298 million in operating cash flow. We continue to implement our capital allocation strategy, as discussed during our Analyst and Investor Day. We made multiple investments in our ecosystem and continued our strategic M&A activities. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 3 million shares at an average price of $105.50 per share, and paid dividends of $94 million.Now on to our guidance for the second quarter of FY '20. We expect our revenue to be between $800 million and $850 million. The midpoint and wider than usual guidance range reflect a full quarter impact from the shipping restrictions to Huawei other than trade -- other current trade-related uncertainty and our usual business variability. More specifically, our guidance range includes an estimate of revenue from the resumption of shipments of currently permissible products to Huawei and contribution from other products that are pending government approvals for shipping licenses.On Huawei, while we aren't quantifying their revenue contribution, our expectation for Huawei this year have been reduced by more than half. Building on that point, our outlook for the WWG business is for a slight decline. Wired is expected to decline and Wired -- Wired is expected to decline and Wireless is expected to grow slightly. Again, we do anticipate a headwind from the Huawei situation, but we expect strength across our broad customer base to provide some offset.Data center is expected to rebound strongly. Our backlog is healthy and indicate significant growth is coming from our advanced memory architecture related business. We are expecting growth from the expansion of business at other hyperscalers as well.Finally, we expect some growth from crypto although that business remains volatile and relatively small. For AIT, we expect the business to decline in Q2. This is primarily a result of an anticipated pause in a customer-specific program, driving a decline in TME. Industrial is expected to be negatively impacted by order timing and macro issues.A&D is expected to grow, providing a partial offset. Our ABC business is expected to grow in Q2. We forecast growth in auto and broadcast and we expect consumer to remain steady. To recap, we are guiding our Q2 modestly downward mainly due to the shipping restrictions on Huawei. That said, we believe that outside of the trade-related issues, our revenue outlook continues to demonstrate the breadth and resilience of our business model.Gross margin is expected to be between 65% and 66% on a GAAP basis and 66% and 67% on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP gross margin is essentially flat from Q1 as expected. The decline in GAAP gross margin is due primarily to incremental acquisition-related amortization expense. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, GAAP operating expense will grow in Q2 and is expected to be $326 million.The increase is primarily due to increased employee compensation and acquisition-driven expenses. The growth in compensation reflects our annual focal process, including stock grants and organic and inorganic growth to our employee base. Non-GAAP operating expense will be approximately $322 million. While we expect Solarflare to close this quarter, precise timing of the close is uncertain. Therefore, we have not included revenue or expense estimates in our outlook for Q2.Depending on the timing of the close, additional non-GAAP OpEx could be between $10 million to $15 million for the quarter as we onboard Solarflare employees. We also expect to have incremental revenue of mid to high single-digit millions in the quarter. This revenue would be a slightly higher than corporate gross margins.GAAP and non-GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $11 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 0% for Q2. This low rate is a one quarter phenomenon due to the tax accounting rules for share-based compensation.We expect the quarterly tax rate to normalize in the second half of the year to a range between 7% and 10%. We expect share count to decrease slightly in Q2, which is the net result of our share repurchases offsetting our annual stock grants.As I close, Victor and I realize there will be a great interest in our outlook beyond Q2. At this point in time, we are monitoring the China trade situation and the overall economic environment. Given the uncertainty of -- regarding these important factors, we are not reiterating or updating our full-year guidance today. We expect to provide an update on our fiscal '20 outlook at our October earnings call.Overall, we believe our long-term growth drivers remain very much intact. Although our FY '20 revenue expectations have been somewhat moderated by trade-related concerns, we continue to believe that the second half of our fiscal year will be better than our first half.Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. -- Thanks for taking my question. Victor, since Huawei is of so much importance to investors, I was really hoping if you could give us some rough sense of how large it was as a customer in your last fiscal year. I realize that it was not 10%. So you have not disclose that. But any rough sense would be really helpful. And then how much of a headwind was it in June and how you're thinking about it in the September quarter, just because it's such a large variable in thinking about the business in the near term? Thank you. -- Yeah, well, look again Huawei is a very important customer to us. And, but as you said, we had no 10% customer in FY '19 nor in first quarter of FY '20. Huawei, is important. That said, we are able to hit the midpoint to our guidance, because we were able to ship for half the quarter but as I said, the resilience of the business and all the other markets being very strong, particularly AIT, also seeing some more strength in some of the other wireless, as well as the wired growth as we expected and just plain a lot of hard work, we managed to offset that.I think you should take away the fact that at our Analyst Day we had said that Q2 would be flattish to Q1 and now we're guiding slightly down from that shows that clearly there is impact despite the fact that we're able to hit the mid range. And just in terms of the general size, I mean clearly as Lorenzo said this range that we gave of Q2 shows that our current expectations well, less than half than what we thought of begin with. So the way you should think about this is kind of the exposure to volatility around this is greatly reduced now because of how we're thinking about the business.Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. -- Great. Thank you. I wonder if, obviously there's variability in the second half of the year. That's pretty clear. How are you thinking about OpEx in that context? Could you see OpEx come down if the revenue expectations come down or just what's the flexibility around that? -- Joe, I mean, look, I think if you, if you take a step back and say, other than this trade situation, our main thesis of everything we said during Analyst Day remains intact. Right, that's what Lorenzo closed with the fact that we have really still strong growth drivers in 5G. Yes, Huawei is an impact, but the rest of 5G is still there. Data center, automotive in the longer term and built on top of all the multiple diverse slots [Phonetics] that we have and so forth.So, I think when we think about it, we said -- and we are investing in order to stay in kind of mid-teens kind of growth in the next five years. Nothing really in the near term says that we should get off of that strategy in that -- and that's an thesis, right. So, we are still essentially moving forward with our investments. But of course, we are monitoring situation very carefully. -- Okay.Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. -- Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a gross margin question. Revenues guided modestly lower but gross margins also lower. And I think we all thought that wireless, particularly Huawei and the mix was the headwind. And therefore, if that's getting pulled out, why are gross margins at the midpoint guided lower? And then what gives confidence that you can get back to that kind of 69% territory in the second half of the fiscal year? -- So, C.J., couple of points. First, in this case, I would say, you should look at the non-GAAP gross margin guide as more relevant to the question you asked. And we have -- what I should have said, if I didn't say at all, I'll clarify is that non-GAAP gross margin is basically flat quarter-on-quarter. How that -- it comes about due to the mix is we also said that the wireless part of our business is going to grow, albeit slightly. And significantly, I also said that in AIT, we should see a decline, which has generally benefited gross margin. So the result is a mix of those factors. Does that help? -- Could I also just add that? Let me just add that, it isn't that Huawei being a little more large chunk [Phonetics]. It's the wireless sector as a whole, right. And so while wireless is down a bit, it's still pretty meaningful part, right. So I think we really -- I think that's the way to think of it. It isn't just a Huawei issue. It's just -- we still have a very meaningful wireless business. And then the other part that Lorenzo said about, the other segment. -- So, just in case I wasn't clear when I did my prepared remarks, from Q1 to Q2 wireless business, despite Huawei shipping restrictions, it is going to increase slightly. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. -- Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to get back to data center. This is such a big underpinning of the -- one of the big underpinnings of the investment case for Xilinx. Could you just provide us with a rough breakdown of -- and you have given numbers now for the last three years, plus the additional quarters. What is the makeup of the business?Victor, if you think about the kind of the old traditional workhorse for Xilinx, which was storage servers as well as automation versus the new businesses that you are winning. And then in your full-year guide that you are not able to reiterate, which I completely understand given the uncertainties. But do you expect data center because this was supposed to be the biggest growth driver, I think up $55 million to $65 million [Phonetics] at the Analyst Day? Are you willing to stick to that or even that's off the table for now? Thank you. -- So, Lorenzo is going to give you some clarity on the first detailed part about traditional versus new. What I would say is, probably, again is like, Huawei, actually the way we tend [Phonetics] to think about as wireless business but their cloud business is a significant business to them. Everyone is aware that they had been in production with FaaS. So, as we said, one of the big hits for the quarter was we weren't able to ship some additional deployments that we were going to do on FaaS.The second, as Lorenzo kind of expressed was kind of a transition on a significant memory business. And again, both of those businesses are the new good interesting business, right, as opposed to traditional, not really acceleration storage kind of business, right?To your broader question around, if this was going to be one of our big growth drivers, yes, it was going to be one. On a percentage basis, you're right. On an apples-to-apples basis, obviously it's still small. If that's -- I guess what I would say is that I just want to say that it wasn't the only thing that was going to drive our business, of course, right. And look, we still see our opportunity is very big. We're going after that aggressively. We're not reguiding the year again, but we're sticking to our significant opportunity and growth there.So again, stay tuned to Q2. And then we -- and one other thing is, you didn't actually explicitly asked this. But we're confident that we're going to bounce back in Q2 with strong double-digits because we see the backlog, right? We've already factored in that we can ship to Huawei. So that downside that we couldn't have predicted is in there and we see the solid backlog.So, Lorenzo, do you have the approximate between ""new answer""? -- No, I -- actually, Ambrish, I don't want to make that cut up on the fly. I don't have it handy. But what I can tell you if this helps is, in video, the core data center business growth that Victor alluded to, as we go from Q1 to Q2 is almost entirely the new business, if you will. And we can get back to you on the historical stuff. Sorry about that. -- No worries. Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe two related. We'll see. Just on the wireless side, with the guide to back up, you are back close to kind of peak levels and that's without, I guess, some portion of Huawei. So, I'm just kind of curious if you can comment on some of the strength. And then I know geographic breakdowns of revenue is never a great way to look at SMEs [Phonetics], but Asia was up big. I was wondering if you can comment on that as well. -- Yeah. I mean, again, just qualitatively, I think this speaks to the overall strength of 5G, which, again, that isn't -- our thesis hasn't changed there. Obviously, Huawei is important, but it's not like we had no impact. But just speaking to the strength of the 5G deployment is really happening. Korea started last year, but that's not -- and so that's over. And I think, remind everybody that Huawei is a key customer as is ZTE. And we continue to ship to ZTE and as well as all the other ones, right. We ship to all the big players in wireless. So, I think that's really what you're seeing and -- -- No, I think that aligns with the Asia growth story as the primary driver. And we did see maybe significantly less important in overall impact. We did see some strength in the industrial end-market in Asia as well. -- Thanks, guys.Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Victor, just relative to the September guide for wireless to be up slightly, I understand the headwind coming from Huawei. I'm just kind of curious if that up factors in baseband ASIC displacement with radio growth, or is the ASIC displacement more something we see as a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year. And as that becomes a bigger headwind, how do you -- how should we think about your ability to grow the business sequentially? -- Yeah. I mean, as far as the ASIC displacement, as I said in my opening remarks, just to lean into that a little bit more, is that's factored in. It was factored in when we shared what we thought we would do at the Analyst and Investor Day. So, we are planning on the facts that we will see some displacement.I would say that it's not that we've seen that to date, but we are still -- no change in terms of when we think that's going to happen. Let's put it that way. And so that also means that as Lorenzo said, we still do feel that the second half will be stronger than the first half, but we will give you the detail after the close of this quarter. That -- again that factors in any ASIC displacement. -- Thank you. -- Welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to go to the AIT segment. You gave a little bit of color why that was better than expected. But I wanted to see -- two parts on that. Was there an inventory dynamic there where there were some inventory build that was benefiting that in the June quarter. In the September quarter guide, it seems like if I put all the moving parts in right, that it has to fall off pretty substantially on a sequential basis. So, I just want to see if there is a little more color about what's happening in the September guide for that segment? -- So, let me start with, Ross, the smaller piece of the history. There was some inventory build in the strength in industrial in Q1, low double -- very low double-digit millions, if you will. In the Q2 guide, even as we went into this fiscal year and incorporated in, what we said at Analyst Day, we were aware of a significant customer whose program timing would cause a pause in this quarter in the revenue. And so that's factored in and it is a significant decline in the TME part of the business specifically. -- And is that something that will bounce back in the next quarter? -- We expect it to bounce back in the second half of the year. -- Great. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. -- Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'm hoping to dig into the 5G dynamics a little bit. The wave that you're describing this market, it almost sounds like, well, if our customers can't buy from Huawei, there is a bunch of other vendors and they can buy from them and we're shipping there. And so it's almost as though, their ability to switch is rather easy and I'm surprised to hear that. And maybe I'm misinterpreting it, but maybe can you comment as to the performance and demand trends at your customers and what your customers' customers the carriers are telling you about their ability to adjust in that regard? Thank you. -- So, no, I do not think at all that we were trying to convey that and we don't believe that. It's not like they can just swap. I think maybe a better way to think about is the initial -- we're in the early phases of 5G. We're just in the initial phases of the first, the initial deployments in the first day when we see multiple phases. I think what we're seeing is in China for this very first phase, there's not that much change.And as you know, the big players are Huawei and ZTE, then other vendors get some portion of the market but it's relatively modest. There's really no change to that qualitative thing. And the other points outside of China, of course, are not affected, right? Everybody is rolling through that. We are saying that we have a great visibility on what's going to happen to later deployments in China. Obviously, we can't because you don't know what's going to happen with the trade situation and so forth. And to your point, it's not just like they could just -- everybody could just swap. So, yeah -- no, we don't -- we didn't mean to imply that and we don't subscribe to that perspective. -- Perhaps I misunderstood. If I can squeeze a follow-up in, there has been a lot of speculation that Huawei might have built as much inventory as they could. We've heard speculation it's up to two years. It seems impossible to me. Do you have any perspective on Huawei's potential build of your products? -- Yeah. Look, I mean we had that question multiple times at the Analyst Day and we reiterated, we absolutely do not see that, absolutely not. We do not see that. And just so you know why we are so adamant from our perspective. I can't speak for anyone else's part because to do the 5G, you need our most advanced parts. And we know exactly where that's going. You can't buy that through other sources. So, we're very confident about -- there is no -- anything near that kind of inventory build, right, process -- Thank you. -- You're welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird. -- Hi. Good afternoon. Looking at the potential displacement of your FPGAs in baseband against ASIC, how should we look at the trajectory of your average content per base station in terms of magnitude a year from now? Are we looking at maybe a 50% cut on average at your large China customer? Any quantification you could give us? -- Look, I mean, I think in our Analyst Investor Day, we kind of walked through that as best we can hit. So, I don't want to attempt to try and go through that again. So if you were to take the trade thing off, I would say there's nothing different about how we feel about it today, from what we shared at the Analyst Investor Day. The exact details of the value content does vary by OEM as well, right?In the case of China and Huawei, it's like, OK, if we can ship then in those systems, then it's not a matter of the degree. It's just that we're not shipping, right? So, again, I would just summarize and say that there's really no difference in how we think about broadly the content, including ASIC displacement. We factored that in, right? -- Okay. Thank you. -- Sure.Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Victor, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the automotive business. You mentioned that there were some weakness in the quarter, given some of the unit trends in the market. But how fast did the business grow on a year-over-year basis? What's kind of the outlook into September and beyond?And I think at the Analyst Day, you guys have talked about the design wins and those ramping over the next year or two. Any changes to that outlook? Again, as it relates to automotive. And then separately, I mean you guys gave accretion details for Solarflare. I was hoping you could do the same for NGCodec. Thank you. -- Okay. Let me take the auto one and then perhaps Lorenzo can speak to the last part. So as Lorenzo said, there is softness in the auto market and I think -- broadly, I think people have heard that. And there is a correlation to the whole China situation, right, because a lot of -- there's a lot of business that they ship into China, so the fact that we had some issues there has caused some slowdown in the things that are in production.Now if you kind of look at it, a lot of what we talked about in the Analyst Day, too, is how we're being designed into new systems in addition to what's already in production. That continues with full momentum, very broad in terms of next-generation ADAS, in-cabin kind of systems, kind of new systems as well as fully autonomous driving. So, that continues and we feel very good about that, no change. Everybody is investing for kind of that future growth. And in the near term, there is some softness. Nonetheless, we will still -- we still do expect to see growth in this segment, but obviously that's moderated. -- Yeah. So, I'll take the last two on auto. It was a little bit lower than previous quarter, this quarter then we had expected to grow. And what we're seeing is the impact of -- would you characterize our business in customers from outside of China selling autos in China, was one of the drivers for the lower-than-expected performance.I do appreciate the fact that you asked about the longer-term growth trend, as year-over-year we did see greater than 5% growth and maybe more importantly, if you take the trailing 12-months versus the prior trailing 12-months, we see double-digit percentage growth in our auto business, so we still see very strong growth trajectory there over the course of time.And on NGCodec, it's a relatively immaterial transaction. We know -- we're not providing the kind of accretion assessment that you asked for. But we did, in the transaction, got a very, very good highly qualified IP team. And so we're really pleased with that acquisition. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. -- Yes. Thank you. I wanted to return to some of your earlier comments about 5G and some of the advanced parts that you're shipping in there. And the question is, what's your customers' alternative to what you ship in the event that either they can't get components over the long term or if because of the trade situation, they choose to reduce their reliance on US-based suppliers. I'd have to imagine with all that's going on, that's one of the things in their mind. What sort of long-term risk does that provide for you? And do you think there are reasonable alternatives out there that would be competitive threat to you? -- Well, look, I guess in the near term, they -- Huawei, everybody knows, it has a subsidiary, HiSilicon, that does their ASICs and they do use them quite a bit. I have no -- I don't really have any insight. So, I don't want to speculate exactly what they do. I would imagine that if this situation prolongs, they'll lean into what they already used, which is ASICs. That can happen quickly because they -- when you are architecting some way, it's not like you could just change that on the dime. In terms of other replacement -- and if you didn't say this, but if you are referring to, like in China, domestic replacements, those customer -- companies we watch.And they're all doing very low-end things that certainly could not replace us in anything approaching 5G. So, I think that's a fairly far out. In terms of other kinds of strategy, replacement or whatever, again, I don't want to speculate. But basically, as I said is, for the near term, I don't really see how they would do it other than just focusing on ASICs more -- All right. Thank you. -- Welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with SIG. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Yeah, on 5G, I think you guys covered Korea and a bit of a pickup in China. But have you seen anything yet really, or can you describe what you've seen in North America, Japan and perhaps any other geos popping their head up? -- Yeah, I mean, Japan is going to start. We believe that will happen, but it will be kind of a little bit more of a moderate things than what we've seen in the first two geographies going. North America will -- traditionally, has moved a little slower. We don't see anything different in that. And then probably Europe after that. So, we don't see something really imminent, although there is certainly a lot of activities. So, that's our outlook at the moment.Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Instinet. -- Thanks very much. You mentioned that you were applying for licenses to ship the remaining product, Huawei ones to them. Are there any guidelines the Commerce Department provides for the types of licenses as to when you might be able to expect a decision? -- Two clarifications. It wasn't licenses for all the remaining product. Again, we -- what we've just recently begun shipping is things that we feel even with that -- with the restrictions that we have, we can legally ship. What we've applied to the licenses is some additional product, but certainly not all of them. Because again, there has been no change to the overall restriction respect to security, national security, right? So, that's kind of what Lorenzo was trying to express is that the midpoint of our guidance for Q2 is just assuming that we can continue to ship the things that we just started shipping. And it's our estimate of what we will ship. The upper end of the range, certainly would require us getting some approval for some additional product, but it is not all of the product. And of course, we have to get that approval still enough so that we can ship.So, there's still uncertainty and dynamics around that. So -- and then in terms of when these things typically get responded to by the government, in usual circumstances, what we have heard is 69 days. But as you may have read, there has been some recent meetings with the administration in various departments and saying that they are going to be expediting those companies that have put in licenses. And that might happen much sooner than that in a matter of weeks, but nothing specific has been given. And then, of course, we have no idea where we are on the queue. -- Great. Thanks so much. -- Welcome.Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. -- Hey. Thanks, guys. Just two quick clarifications. So Vic, you said you're trying to restore some of the lost Huawei business. How much of that business do you think is just gone forever like you can't ship? And then how big was the one memory customer that's having the products transition in the Data Center Group? -- So, let me talk to the first one. So, I don't think that we've lost anything that we just will completely lose because again, that were just one or two things that they've got a complete replacement on a dime or they're just going to give up on that business and they are certainly not going to give up on 5G. And again, as we said, they have architected in a certain way that's not something that anybody could just change on dime. If they start prolonging for a very long period of time, which I certainly hope isn't going to happen, which I expressed in my comments as well, we really certainly hope we could resolve these important issues as quickly as possible. In which case then, we will have some resumption.But I think, again, if you kind of think about the guide, if you kind of look at it, even if we got a meaningful, the vast majority of everything we applied for in the license and we continue to ship what we have, that's still less than half of the revenue we would have expected for Huawei if nothing had occurred. That's what Lorenzo had guided to help you understand what we're doing. So, that tells you that, of course, that 5G and the other things that what we're doing are very meaningful for us, right.And then the... -- The last part of your question, Chris, on the memory-related customer, clearly, we won't just give you a very specific number for them if they are less than 10%. I will say that in relation to the overall data center business, which is relatively small as we've disclosed it, it's a significant customer. -- Okay. Thanks .Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. -- Yeah. Hi, guys. Just on the wireless growth. Good to see, you're growing from Q1 to Q2 despite Huawei. Is it fair to say that you're growing that wireless business, not just despite Huawei, but also your ASICs, the audio baseband exposure is coming down? And also if you could give us some color on how your 7-nanometer Versal is ramping? Thanks -- So on the baseband, again, I would -- I know there's a lot of questions around that. That's why I would say, we've always contemplated whatever replacement that we would see there. Nothing has really changed. Again, Huawei's -- the way you think of it is that even in the licensing, it's really not a 5G designed-in business kind of things, right? That -- so there -- it's not just the baseband question. It's just Huawei and wireless 5G.With respect to Versal, actually that's going really well. As we said, we already sampled to the very leading customers. We have literally hundreds of people in the early access program, where they're already using the software and getting ready for designs. Obviously, we just initially shipped. Throughout this whole quarter, we will be expanding sampling and so forth. As I said, the silicon testing is really rock solid. So, we're very excited. The feedback has been good, I will say that, of course, so this is still sampling period. So, revenue would be very modest. Until we go into production in FY '21, you're not going to see meaningful revenue. But in terms of momentum and taking our platform to the next level, we're in really good shape. Very excited about that. -- All right. Thanks. -- WelcomeYour next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. -- Hi, guys. Just wanted to clarify. I think, coming out of the Analyst Day, you had sort of talked about WWG being sort of flattish to down on a quarterly basis into the second half of the fiscal year to incorporate that ASIC replacement. But on the call, I think this evening you said you think now WWG would be up in the second half despite the Huawei shipment ban. So, I'm just trying to reconcile those comments. Is the base business in 5G or wire just now better than 90 days ago? Or did I miss something? -- So, Quinn, may have been some form of miscommunication. We didn't say anything specifically on this call about second half wireless trajectory. We are reserving the next few months to get much more clarity on the Huawei situation and the larger trade situation. So sorry, if there was a miscommunication there. -- What we did say is we expect our second half over... -- Overall. -- Overall. Okay. -- That whole business [Speech Overlap] our business in the second half, which we said at Analyst Day, albeit, it's moderated now because unless we get full resolution of Huawei, we can resume all shipping to Huawei, then obviously, it's not going to be as strong as what we said. But we still think, qualitatively, we believe the second half of this fiscal year will be stronger. And again, we will give you all that information after the close of this, which by the way, we know -- part of that, we'll get clarity on these licenses we have put in that we discussed. We just think we'll be in better place to give you something without speculating. -- Okay. Thank you. -- And operator, we're going to do one more question, please.Yes, sir. Your last question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. -- Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Victor, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question on ACAP Versal as you're starting to sample and potentially ramp the product here in the coming quarters. If you might give us a little bit of context around the software ecosystem and the software environment that you guys have built behind the scenes for the product, maybe the level of first customer engagements. Do you have any NRE funding on software that you're engaged in just the -- I guess, the depth and breadth of the software engagement around that new platform, any context will be really helpful. Thank you. -- Yeah, that's a very good question. Obviously, it's a very disruptive [Phonetics] product and it's a very powerful. So, we do need to bring it along and the software tools along with it. As I said in my comments that you're going to hear, we're going to do [Indecipherable] pre-give details. But we are at XDF in October are going to announce new software development environment that isn't just a Versal, but it will, of course, go forward with Versal and we are going to -- we've invested a lot in it.And we are going to significantly improve the user experience and make it more accessible to more developers, so we are investing a lot. We're also doing other things beyond just our internal in terms of driving ecosystem in IP, in libraries, optimize libraries and other things around run time. So it's a good point. We are investing a lot. It is important. You will hear more details about that at XDF. So hopefully, you can make that or stay tuned. -- Appreciate that. Thanks. -- Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific, 8:00 p.m. Eastern time today. And for a copy of our earnings release, please visit our Investor Relations website.Our next earnings release date for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 will be on Wednesday, October 23, after the market close.

"he Trump administration is locked in  with China that isn't showing any signs of ending. The situation seems to be escalating day by day as both sides are unwilling to reach a compromise. President Trump has threatened to further raise tariffs on Chinese imports if there's no progress on trade talks at the end of this month.There are a ton of companies and industries suffering thanks to the U.S.-China trade war, but there's one unlikely beneficiary that could witness a turnaround in its fortunes:  . The iPhone maker has been struggling to sell its premium devices thanks to the emergence of , but Trump's trade war could prove to be a tailwind for Apple. Let's see why.Image source: Getty Images.Huawei has turned out to be  for Apple in recent years. In fact, the Chinese company occupied the second place in global smartphone shipments in the first quarter of 2019 with a market share of 19%, according to IDC. This is a nice jump from the year-ago period's market share of 11.8%.Apple's fortunes, on the other hand, have nosedived over the same period. The company has now slipped to third in global smartphone shipments with a market share of 11.7%. A year ago, Apple occupied the second spot with a market share of 15.7%. The iPhone maker's shipments fell an alarming 30% year over year during the first quarter, while Huawei saw a 50% spike.However, Huawei's growth seems all set to take a hit as it is the poster boy of the U.S.-China trade war. The U.S. is going all-out to freeze Huawei, with the Trump administration blacklisting the Chinese conglomerate that's known for supplying networking gear and smartphones.As Huawei is now on the U.S.'s Entity List, meaning any U.S. company looking to do business with the Chinese company will have to obtain an export license from the Commerce Department. As it turns out, the Department follows a policy of denying such applications, as reported by Politico.Not surprisingly, Huawei is witnessing major fallout from this move as several companies are now unwilling to do business with the chipmaker. For instance,  has  its data-storage products to the Chinese company. 's Google had also taken the step to  with Huawei, restricting updates on the Chinese company's Android-powered devices.Moreover, chipmakers such as , , and  are also stopping Huawei from using their products and technology.Huawei claims that it has enough chips in storage to last for six months of smartphone production. At the end of those six months, it aims to start making its own chips, and also deploy its own operating system to replace Android. But there's one problem that Huawei might not be able to overcome.British chip designer ARM has reportedly told employees to immediately stop providing services and technology to Huawei. That's because ARM licenses technology from U.S. companies as well, which is why it falls under the ambit of the U.S. ban on Huawei.This is bad news for Huawei as 98% of smartphones globally contain at least one chip designed by ARM. This means Huawei will now have to design certain chips from scratch as it cannot license ARM technology anymore under the current scenario.But the lack of parts and technology is just one side of the equation. As leading technology providers cut off their supplies to Huawei, consumers might lose confidence in the Chinese smartphone maker. This has the potential to dent sales, and probably allow Apple to claw back its smartphone market share.Apple lost ground in the smartphone space to Huawei as the latter started delivering  at competitive prices. But the iPhone maker's sales could get a shot in the arm thanks to the U.S. ban on Huawei for a few simple reasons.As I have already stated, Huawei runs the risk of losing consumer confidence. If you're worried that you might lose Android support to your smartphone, there's a good chance you might not buy a device from that brand.Second, Apple is expected to remain unaffected (or less affected) by the U.S.-China trade war despite its manufacturing footprint in China. That's because Foxconn, which is Cupertino's largest manufacturing contractor, recently said that 25% of iPhone production capacity is outside of China. Foxconn went on to add that it has ""enough capacity to meet Apple's demand,"" and it could move its entire production out of China if needed.But even if Apple doesn't elect to move its production out of China and decides to absorb the costs of any tariff, the iPhone maker's earnings per share will take a hit of only 6% to 7%,  reports. Passing on the tariffs to customers could increase iPhone prices in a range of 9% to 16%, and that could reduce demand by 10% to 40%.So, it would make sense for Apple to absorb the higher tariffs if they come into play later this month. That's because if Apple manages to eat into Huawei's market share, its sales should improve and help offset some of the margin losses.Apple's sales in Europe fell nearly 23% in the first quarter of 2019, while Huawei's shipments had shot up 66%. As such, Apple has a lot to gain from Huawei's travails.Moreover, Apple won't have to run from pillar to post for parts and technology like Huawei. So, it should ideally be able to produce phones in larger quantities compared to its Chinese rival, which now has to work on developing in-house chips.As such, don't be surprised to see an uptick in iPhone sales as those who were looking to buy a Huawei device shift to Cupertino's offerings or other Android phones, making Apple an unlikely beneficiary of the U.S.-China trade war.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average.  There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $80.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $156.00.  The standard deviation is $17.853.


But the whole reason to look at the average XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.  And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $121.14/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $121.14 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?  Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

Shares of   gained 15.3% in June, according to data from . The programmable chip specialist saw its stock rise thanks to broader market momentum and news that its seven nanometer (nm) Versal adaptive compute acceleration program (ACAP) chips had begun shipping to customers. data by .Xilinx touted its 7nm Versal ACAPs as the first chips in their class in a press release published on June 18 and stated that these uniquely powerful chips were significantly more capable than traditional central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Shares jumped following news that the company's new chips were on their way to customers and climbed even higher to close out the month.Image source: Xilinx.The company's press release described the capabilities and applications of the Versal ACAP chip family as follows:An ACAP is a highly integrated, multicore, heterogeneous compute platform that can be changed at both the hardware and software levels to dynamically adapt to the needs of a wide range of applications and workloads in data center, automotive, 5G wireless, wired and defense markets. Built from the ground-up to be natively software programmable, the Versal ACAP architecture features a flexible, multi-terabit per-second network-on-chip (NoC). The NoC seamlessly integrates all engines and key interfaces, making the platform available at boot and easily programmed by software developers, data scientists and hardware developers alike. Through a host of tools, software, libraries, IP, middleware, and frameworks, ACAPs enable dynamically customizable accelerated computing solutions through industry-standard design flows.  The reported power and flexibility of these chips appears to reinforce Xilinx's position as a leader in semiconductors for high-end, intensive computing applications, and news that they are now shipping to customers shows that they are ready for market and could become a meaningful sales contributor in the not-too-distant future.Xilinx's strength in programmable chips makes the stock  like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. There aren't many players in the company's corner of the semiconductor market, and its product specialties look like they will continue to be crucial to enabling some of the biggest tech advancements of the next decade.Shares now trade at roughly 30 times this year's expected earnings and come with the 1.2% dividend yield.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Early in May, I said that  (NASDAQ:) stock was  at $45 per share. Well now, Intel stock is above $46, so while not a multi-bagger win it’s still up. But the point I made then is even more true now. INTC has more upside potential than downside risk from here.Source: Shutterstock
	I am a big fan of the products that Intel provides, but not so much of the recent management decisions. But therein lies INTC’s potential. If they’re not making good decisions now then they can remedy that going forward in order to create value in Intel stock price.More importantly, since my write up, we had another test of support in equities and INTC. The test was successful so I can assume that the zone around $43 per share in Intel stock is a floor for now.Conversely, I recognize that if for whatever reason the floor fails, then it could trigger another leg lower that could target $36 per share. This is not my forecast, but it is a scenario that exists.As far as valuation, Intel is cheap from a P/E ratio perspective. It sells at a 10.7 trailing P/E which is half as expensive as  (NASDAQ:) and maybe ten times cheaper than  (NASDAQ:). While this doesn’t guarantee success, it does say that owning Intel shares at this valuation is not likely to be a financial catastrophe in the long run.AMD is still the star of the group, so if I wanted to go long the group and if the markets continue to rally it would be the better choice. But it also has a lot of froth that could fall flat the first sign of trouble. The floor in AMD relative to INTC is an abyss too deep for my taste here.Intel has the potential of a catch-up trade to redeem itself and fill the gaps above. The first one would bring it up to $50 per share area. The second one is more exciting that would take it all the way to $58 or higher. There will be resistance on the way up at $48, $51, and $53. These were ledges from which Intel fell apart on the way down.The rally won’t be easy. The weekly chart shows that the current zone around $48 per share has been pivotal since October of 2017. So onus is on the bulls to reclaim it so they can start using it as forward support. The good news is that the same chart also shows that anything below $43 per share should be solid support. So to help the INTC stock bulls, there is a nice stable footing for them to step off of.In 2016, Intel stock made a major $10 leap higher from the $38 zone. So onus is on the bears to prove that it was a mistake. Its current fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment, suggest that it’s not a realistic bearish expectation to fall back below. The U.S. is at full employment, and the global central banks are in full bull mode. So I fail to see the reason why a quality stock like Intel should revert to 2016 prices.Cheap valuation does not guarantee upside price movement. So those who know options can avoid buying shares and hope for a rally. They can instead sell puts against the support levels to create income with no money out of pocket. This way even if the stock meanders lower this year they can still profit.In essence they  would be getting long INTC with a nice pad from current price just in case the macroeconomic conditions change dramatically. After all we are still at a threat geopolitical headlines especially from the economic war between the U.S. and China.Although I see an upside opportunity, the price action is not intuitively bullish. INTC stock is lagging the sector. Year-to-date, it’s down 1% while AMD, NVDA and the  (NYSEARCA:) are up 74%, 10% and 20% respectively. So critics can argue that INTC stock is broken. I’d say it’s definitely bruised and the company is healthy enough to fix it.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

What are the many issues that management must fix?More important, investors must ask if it is too late to turn the business around as AMD jumps ahead in the desktop PC and server market.Advanced Micro Devices announced 7nm Navi GPU and the next-generation Ryzen at Computex. This jump ahead is in stark contrast to Intel’s glaringly disappointing delays for the 10nm launch. On its  in late April, the company said it will launch 10nm chips during the holiday season.On closer inspection, the 10nm roadmap might have just one four-core laptop. The key idea is its  is in limited quantities; 14nm will still be a large part of its product roadmap and product mix in 2020 and 2021.The following month, Intel  that 10nm CPU production will start in July and will start with the mobile Ice Lake platform. Multiple 10nm products potentially show up this year and in 2020.Needless to say, AMD’s 7nm ramp-up will further its lead over Intel. And since AMD will have desktop chips out first, enthusiasts will pick its chip over Intel’s offering.Today, AMD’s 16-core 5GHz  beat Intel’s $2000 i9 9980XE. Price-conscious consumers will choose AMD chips unless Intel cuts prices.In the server space, AMD’s EPYC is a compelling offering over Intel’s server chips. Still, a security vulnerability in AMD EPYC chips may slow the market share growth for EPYC. Since it was discovered, AMD issued a  to fix the bug.The U.S./China trade tensions, along with the U.S. ban on Huawei, will hurt Intel’s revenue. Intel and other chipmakers, including  (NASDAQ:) and (NASDAQ:), are the government against the Huawei ban.They are seeking for an easing in restrictions. Otherwise, the chipmakers stand to lose billions in revenue. For now, Intel and  (NASDAQ:) found  to work around the ban by not labeling the products as American-made.The companies will get Huawei components this way but unless the government lifts the ban, it may reinforce its efforts and close the loopholes.Intel trades at a modest valuation of 10.7 times forward earnings, so chances are good that the impact of trade restrictions is already priced in the stock. But investors could also buy Micron stock based on forward P/E valuations of sub-10 times that are lower than that of Intel.Wall Street has more “hold” ratings than “buy” ones on Intel stock but still set a .If investors build a valuation model based on Intel’s 2.61% dividend yield, then the stock has a fair value in the high $50s. Conversely, using a 5-year DCF EBITDA Exit model, assume revenue grows between -3% and +4%. In this scenario, Intel stock has a fair value of $45.40, 6% below its $48.19 closing price (per )AMD is the all-star CPU supplier these days but Intel is like a slow and steady bond that pays a fair dividend. Its production delays for next-generation chips are a setback for now. As management rights its ship by addressing the manufacturing issue, the stock will continue its rebound.Though the stock may spend more time in a range of between $44 – $50, the breakout above $50 is possible later on down the road. To get there, its first step is getting the 10nm production in the channels and in mass quantities.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The Uptrend in Intel Stock Is Likely to Stall Before Too Long@2019-06-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-uptrend-in-intel-stock-is-likely-to-stall-before-too-long-2019-06-28
"nvestors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options become available today, for the August 9th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new August 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $116.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $116.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $109.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $117.05/share today.

Because the $116.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.34% return on the cash commitment, or 45.37% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $116.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $118.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.70.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $117.05/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $118.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.54% if the stock gets called away at the August 9th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $118.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $118.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.72% boost of extra return to the investor, or 48.59% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 50%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 49%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $117.05) to be 45%.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

"Not too long ago,  (NASDAQ:) stock could do no wrong. At the highs, Wall Street experts unanimously said that it was the stock to own in every portfolio. Nvidia hit $290 per share at its all-time high.Source: Shutterstock
	Since then, Nvidia stock has fallen off a cliff. It’s now under $150 and can’t even hold a rally. In March it showed some promise, but that too failed. The bulls couldn’t even fill a giant open gap from its horrendous November earnings report.I recently wrote a note that it could be headed to $200 per share, but since then, that effort also failed. Now it’s back to the December lows while the  remains 21% off its lows. Clearly NVDA stock is out of favor on Wall Street.So what now? Is it time to panic out of it?No.If I still am long Nvidia at this level, it would be a mistake to capitulate right here. This is a proven bounce level for the stock, so I can probably count on it continuing to be so until it’s lost. Technically speaking, the stock has been in a descending lower high trend bouncing against a proven floor. More often than not, the floor holds, making a rally from these level likely. To open a new trap door from these low levels, I bet it will take incrementally bad news.But the risk is there, so it’s important to know where it lies. If the bears are able to breach this support, then they would trigger a pattern to target $98 per share. This is not my forecast, but it is the negative scenario that looms below.NVDA valuation helps the bulls here. At $290 per share it was too expensive, as the price crash proves. But at these levels here the trailing price-to-earnings ratio is down to 30. This is relatively cheap if I compare it to something like  (NASDAQ:). It is still almost three times as expensive as  (NASDAQ:) — but for good reason. But maybe you get what you pay for, as AMD is up almost 80% year to date, while for the same period NVDA is up 8% and INTC is red.Fundamentally speaking, the demand on  will continue to be strong for years to come. This is a premier technology company and one of only a few that will power the tremendous global migration to the digital world. We have a new world of AI and self-driving cars coming soon. This trend is not likely to reverse anytime soon.Nvidia’s technology is solid, so they show no evidence of managerial flubs. So as an investor, I continue to give them the benefit of the doubt that they will continue to successfully execute on their plans.So to recap so far, here are my assumptions: I acknowledge that NVDA is no longer popular on Wall Street, but that alone is not a bad thing. And they have value here and very little froth left to shed. And most importantly, they still provide excellent products.So I can buy NVDA stock  for the long-term, and I don’t worry about the short-term dips for as long as my assumptions remain true.  For those who prefer to trade around the short-term levels, there are some lines to know.Above $147, it could target $156 per share. But there are resistance levels in the way. On June 5, there was a sharp reversal from $146.20, so I have to mark it as important as well. Conversely, if the bears can break through $139.75, they could get the chance to set a new low below $132.There are outside factors too. It is important to note that any rallies in Nvidia stock will need the help of the global equity markets. We are still under the threat of geopolitical headlines because of the economic wars that are going on, so it would be smart to take positions in tranches and not all at once. This would leave room to manage dips.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"Earlier this month when we learned about the new tariff rates that the U.S. imposed on China, I shared a write-up warning about  (NASDAQ:) being directly in the line of fire of that economic war.Source: Shutterstock
	Since then, MU stock has fallen 15%, so it’s now closer to finding a bottom. Micron is not alone. The  (NYSEARCA:),  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) all fell the same. Only  (NASDAQ:) held well.I never assume that I will find the perfect place to buy a stock, but in this case MU stock seems to be at a point where there’s less risk below than there is upside above.That’s at the heart of today’s thesis — this too shall pass. The U.S. and China will eventually come to some terms that are not disastrous. There’s just too much at stake for everyone involved, and the consequences are global. The leaders understand this, and once they get over their egos, they will move forward with terms that allow for business to continue as is, or close to it.In that case, Micron could rally with fundamentals below to support the bullish effort and recover some recent glory.The fundamentals of Micron are exceptional. This is a leading technology provider that sells at a very low trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 3. While some experts on Wall Street call it a value trap, but that’s the same value that serves as a stabilizing base. Those who already own the shares are not scared out of it.In other words, Micron stock is in strong hands, so it cannot fall too far when it’s this cheap. The only way that would happen is if the whole market collapses from here. The current macroeconomic conditions do not support this doomsday theory.The demand for technology is increasing at an exponential rate. This is a trend that will not reverse. In fact, it will continue to accelerate. Technology begets more technology, and Micron is one of the few companies that supplies the brains of the operation. (NYSE:) made the cloud cool,  (NASDAQ:) built it, and now the rest of the world wants to be on it.With the advent of easy connectivity — like 5G, for example — almost every human on the planet will soon hold a device connected to all the tech around us. So demand for electronic components and services like the ones that MU provides will continue to be strong regardless of how political leaders squabble.Meanwhile, for the short-term, there are important technical lines to know.In my earlier writeup, I noted the fact that MU stock has fallen into a support zone. The price action has not yet been bullish, so clearly the upside triggers are far from triggering. But the support zone is still intact and it extends through $32 per share. As the negative headlines grow more stale, the MU buyers will regain the confidence to reset their positions.The price range is tightening and this builds energy in the stock. Eventually this has to resolve itself in a breakout. If markets in general hold up then Micron will more likely explode up than down.The important line for bulls to hold is $32 while they attack the descending trend line of lower highs. A breach of either of those would bring a move in that direction. So I get long the shares through stock or options and set a stop loss that fits my risk profile.In this case, MU is cheap enough to make it so that this trade can turn into an investment without dire consequences. So even if this short-term potential breakout fails I can hold it for a longer time frame.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

"Hang on to your hats — the stock market’s fundamentals have been hostage to headlines for months. Most recently, the economic war between the U.S. and China took a step backwards, causing a ruckus in the indices price action. But if you believe the rhetoric, you’d think that the  is in free fall. Well it’s not — it is 3.5% off the closing all-time high. Meanwhile, the stock prices of certain groups of stocks are feeling the pain more than others.

	Year to date, AMD is up 52%, compared to  (NASDAQ:) gain of 16% and the  (NYSEARCA:) gain of 19%.  (NASDAQ:) is down 5% for the same period. Clearly investors prefer owning AMD to its competitors and this is today’s point. Owning AMD is the best bet for the intermediate term.The SMH world is in the middle of a tornado and not much has happened to AMD stock. Early in May I suggested you should , and that’s still true today.Long term, tech stocks will be fine because we have too much demand for their products and services. The world is adopting tech at an exponential rate, and it’s a trend that will not revert any time soon.Regardless of the long-term runway for chip stocks, the recent market turmoil has hit the semiconductor stocks especially hard as they sit in the line of fire between the U.S. and China. President Donald Trump recently dialed up the tariff rate on $200 billion worth of goods to 25% and, more importantly, banned Huawei from doing business with the U.S. (though that has been ), and that’s the part that specifically hampers stocks like AMD.The SMH fell 4% just on Monday on no specific headline. The rhetoric on chips stocks is so negative that investors are fleeing the stocks without caring about valuation.Some stocks are faring better than others and Advanced Micro Devices stock has been the star since last year. So if my thesis is that this tariff war malaise will pass, then I want to be long AMD stock instead of INTC or others. AMD fans have proven themselves strong hands and are less eager to sell out of their positions.Case in point, the SMH got clobbered on Monday and fell off a ledge and back to its February contention level. Whereas AMD still is higher than last week’s levels. So even though it too fell on Monday, relatively it is far out-performing the rest of the gang.What makes this even more impressive is that AMD is probably the most expensive of its direct competitors. Its price to earnings ratio is five or ten times more expensive that say INTC or NVDA, yet here it is the one holding the best under duress.Usually in times of macroeconomic and geopolitical risk investors sell the frothiest stocks first. But not in AMD’s case so I hold it if I am long. Conversely if I am looking to catch this falling knife of chip stocks, this is my best bet.So is it the right time to do so? Yes, but the investor’s time frame should dictate how to do it.For those looking to own the shares for the long term, there is no sense in looking for the perfect entry point. Over the long term, a few cents higher or lower won’t matter much. But for those who prefer to manage the short-term risk, there are lines to know.AMD above $28 per share would bring momentum buyers to restart a rally towards $30 per share or higher. There will be resistances at $27.60 and $28.50, but with the proper help from the rest of the markets, they can do it. Conversely, below $26 the bears could gain momentum to target $24.50. This is not a forecast but one of the two scenarios that exists here.In summary, AMD so far has withstood the pressures of the tariff war for almost two years. It is the best pick of the chip stocks regardless of fundamentals. They say that price is truth, and in this case, the price action says it’s the likely best bet.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

" (NASDAQ:) reported earnings last night and investors loved them. NVDA stock spiked 7%… then faded back to red. This is more likely due to overall stock market malaise than Nvidia disappointment, however. We are still dealing with geopolitical headlines a major economic war between the U.S. and China.Source: 
	As of this writing, NVDA had turned green again, up about 1%.The NVDA options markets had priced in a +/- $12 move today and the after hour spike perfectly took the stock to the upper edge of that limit. The open interest in the options markets also suggested upside pressure with resistance this week at $173 and that was exactly where it faded. So the overnight action unfolded exactly as planned. Now the bulls need some follow through as the market shakes the overnight jitters off. And the geopolitical headlines need to cooperate.These last two days are quite the change from earlier this week when equities like NVDA were in free fall. Wall Street panicked from headlines that China retaliated against the new U.S. tariffs. Yet Thursday, NVDA stock closed slightly green ahead of the event.This small upside move was impressive since the Thursday open was scary for chip stocks. They all collapsed on headlines that the U.S. is . So traders then extrapolated that all chip companies are vulnerable too. But this morning the sector is once again trying to find footing as  (NASDAQ:) is helping with its positive reaction to their earnings.NVDA beat both earnings and sales. But more importantly, they raised guidance for the future. So they over-delivered and promised that they will do even better next time. This is reason to hold or start accumulating a position in Nvidia stock.NVIDIA used to be focused on graphics cards, but now they are set up to benefit from several of the hot topics for the next few decades. They have transformed into a dominant player in any tech that needs a brain. From computers on our desks or in our pockets, to ones that drive our cars.Last night’s report shows that NVIDIA has returned to growth, and gaming and data centers are exciting areas of opportunities once more. Also Artificial Intelligence segments will accelerate as adoption of AI grows world wide. This is a budding trend that will dominate in the future. Every aspect of our technology will have AI built into it. Nvidia stock will surely benefit from this trend.Management also noted that the acquisition of  (NASDAQ:) will close by year end. So the noise from the assimilation will die down. They outbid  (NASDAQ:) so they can create more runway in their own data center efforts. This will have incremental profits soon enough.So in summary, Nvidia stock is not a sell here. The management team has proven that they are still on top for their game. They are growing demand for gaming, cloud tech and AI. So they left nothing for the sellers to use as weapons.In addition, there is also the surprise revival of the Crypto-craze as Bitcoin rallied 100% in a month. In the past, NVDA and crypto moved in tandem, but Nvidia has outgrown this. Bitcoin is no longer part of the NVDA investment thesis so it’s pure gravy. So it’s not a threat to the rally since it’s not a major peg that could break.The experts on Wall Street agree that Nvidia stock is a BUY. The average price target is close to $200 per share, which also shows that Wall Street believes that the upside opportunity outweighs the downside risks.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of .

he advent of  (5G) wireless technology is turning out to be a boon for chipmakers. Semiconductor stocks have been  in recent months after a terrible performance last year, and this is just the beginning as we come to the beginning of the 5G deployment cycle. In fact, market-intelligence firm IDC estimates that spending on 5G infrastructure will jump to $26 billion in 2022 from $528 million last year.The likes of   and   stand to gain big from this massive opportunity and potentially deliver a nice upside to investors in the long run. But the cherry on top is that both chipmakers also pay a dividend, which might increase as the 5G catalyst gains traction.Image source: Getty Images.Skyworks made  to increase its dividend in August last year, at a time when its crucial mobile business was on the ropes. The company's top- and bottom-line growth had dried up, and there wasn't much hope for a turnaround.The good news is that Skyworks' 1.7% dividend yield is in the safe territory despite its . Its revenue dropped 11% year over year last quarter, while net income shrank nearly 22% to $214 million, or $1.23 per share. For comparison, Skyworks paid a total of $66 million in dividends during the quarter at $0.38 per share. That means Skyworks paid out nearly 31% of its earnings in the form of dividends.In the prior-year period, Skyworks had generated $276 million in net income ($1.50 per share) and paid $58.4 million ($0.32 per share) in dividends, translating into a  of just over 21%. So the chipmaker's dividend payout ratio has shot up considerably of late, though it is still in safe territory. And it could go higher as earnings are expected to take a hit this fiscal year, according to Yahoo! Finance analysts.But those analysts also forecast a double-digit increase in Skyworks' earnings next fiscal year, so Skyworks' dividend payout ratio could fall. This will also pave the way for further dividend increases as Skyworks stands to win on multiple fronts from the 5G revolution.For instance, demand for the company's smartphone chips will start  as new 5G devices hit the market. At the same time, demand for Skyworks' small cell solutions will also get a shot in the arm. Small cells will play a crucial role in the deployment of 5G networks as they enable high-speed connectivity across a wider area by decongesting the network.The good news is that demand for small cell solutions is expected to balloon in the future, hitting $58 billion in 2024, compared with $12.5 billion a couple of years ago. Such massive end-market opportunities will boost Skyworks' bottom line in the long run, paving the way for more dividend growth.While Skyworks is on the cusp of a 5G-driven turnaround, Xilinx is already enjoying  thanks to the deployment of 5G networks. The company's revenue was up 30% last quarter, and its earnings had increased 34%. The communications business, which accounts for 41% of the company's total revenue, increased 74% year over year thanks to 5G-related demand.Last year, Xilinx paid a cash dividend of $1.44 per share on diluted earnings of $3.47 per share, translating into a dividend payout of ratio just over 41%. Given the pace at which Xilinx's earnings are growing, the chipmaker's payout ratio is on track to drop further.What's more, Xilinx generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion last year. Out of that, it paid $364 million in dividends. Looking ahead, Xilinx's earnings growth is expected to accelerate in the next two fiscal years, recording double-digit increments for both years.That's not surprising, as Xilinx is taking steps to take advantage of the 5G catalyst for as long as possible. The company has enhanced its product portfolio by adding new chip platforms to address 5G demand. For instance, its next-generation Versal chip is programmable at  and software level, which means Xilinx can modify them to act like custom-made 5G chips that telecom companies can deploy.But 5G isn't the only catalyst that's going to drive up Xilinx's earnings. The chipmaker has made  into the automotive segment, striking partnerships with 16 automotive original equipment manufacturers that are using Xilinx's advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) modules. With the ADAS market slated to turn in an annual earnings growth rate of 19% through 2025, Xilinx's automotive business has more room to grow.Xilinx currently has a dividend yield of 1.2%. It has increased the dividend for eight years, at an average rate of 5.4% for the past three years. So as the earnings growth rate accelerates, Xilinx will have more scope to increase the dividend.In the end, investors need to understand that both these stocks are at the beginning of the 5G growth curve. Xilinx is already showing us what the 5G catalyst can do for the business, and Skyworks could soon be following that path. That's why both companies are expected to have nice earnings growth in the future, paving the way for a fatter dividend.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

hip stocks got off to a great start this year after a forgettable 2018, but the  has knocked investor confidence out the window in recent weeks.   and   are among the stocks taking a hit. data by .This latest pullback in shares of Xilinx and Micron could be an opportunity for investors looking to take advantage of hot trends in technology. Both companies believe that they can benefit from autonomous cars and  (5G) wireless networks. But only one of them deserves your money.Image Source: Getty Images.Xilinx stock  in late April after it missed Wall Street's earnings expectations, but that was the only blip in what was otherwise a terrific quarterly report.Xilinx's revenue and earnings were up impressively year over year, and its guidance also trumped Wall Street's expectations. That wasn't surprising, because the company's programmable chips have turned out to be a hit among telecom companies deploying 5G networks.Xilinx's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be  and configured by developers to perform specific tasks. Because custom 5G chips aren't available yet, telecom carriers are turning toward Xilinx's programmable chips, which give them a cheap alternative to reduce the time to market and quickly roll out the network.Xilinx has capitalized on the 5G opportunity by introducing specialized chips. The company claims that its share of baseband revenue in the ongoing 5G deployment phase is higher than usual.A 5G base station packs more antennas as compared to a 4G network, so it consumes more power. Xilinx is taking care of this problem with its integrated chip platform that packs radio frequency chips and a processing system into one package, allowing telecom carriers to keep the size of the base station compact and reduce power consumption at the same time.Meanwhile, Xilinx's automotive business has also gained critical mass in recent quarters. The company gets 14% of its total revenue from this segment (including revenue from the broadcast and consumer solutions business), which grew in the double digits last fiscal year.Looking ahead, Xilinx's automotive business is all set to get better thanks to its relationships with major automotive component suppliers. The company's programmable chips are already powering the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) modules at 16 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). Given that this market is estimated to grow at an annual rate of 19% for the next six years, Xilinx's automotive revenue has a lot of room to grow.While Xilinx has delivered terrific financial growth in recent quarters, Micron has  thanks to the sliding prices of memory chips.The memory market  as a shortage of PC components, weak graphics card demand, and inventory adjustments in the data center space dented demand for the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and NAND flash chips that Micron makes. These headwinds have weighed on Micron's top and bottom lines. data by .But Micron expects a turnaround in the second half of 2019.  to CFO Dave Zinsner in a March call with analysts:We expect our DRAM bit shipments to grow sequentially during the fiscal third quarter and at much higher rates in the fiscal fourth quarter. In NAND, we expect a modest sequential decline in our bit shipments in the fiscal third quarter due to the timing of shipments and expect growth to resume in the fiscal fourth quarter.But Zinsner also said that Micron faces short-term challenges and suffers from poor demand visibility. The company has been forced to idle 5% of its DRAM capacity because of weak demand.What this means is that Micron is trying to reduce the supply glut in the memory market by lowering production. Micron isn't the only one doing so. Leading DRAM manufacturer  has decided to suspend the production of memory chips for a week in June and perhaps longer, until DRAM prices stabilize.A supply cut would help boost memory prices to some extent, but Micron also needs an increase in demand to come to its rescue. The problem is that DRAM demand growth might take some time to arrive.For instance, global smartphone sales have been dwindling, with IDC reporting a 6.6% drop in shipments during the first quarter. 's components shortages have kept a lid on PC shipments, while 's latest results show us that data center spending has paused.In light of these developments, Micron's turnaround isn't guaranteed, which is why it doesn't make sense to take advantage of the stock's recent drop to buy shares.Micron Technology's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 3.3 looks appealing at first, but a forward P/E ratio of 7.7 indicates that the company's earnings are expected to decline. According to analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance, that's indeed going to be the case: Micron's bottom line is estimated to be slashed almost in half this year, with more downside expected next fiscal year.On the other hand, Xilinx's earnings are estimated to increase both this year and the next. So even though Xilinx trades at a much higher forward earnings multiple of 23, it looks to be a better bet when compared to Micron because of its potential to deliver earnings growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"The chip sector has been on fire lately. The  (NYSEARCA:) just set a new all-time high last week when it almost hit $121. This was the target of the technical breakout from $107 per share. So a dip here, if it comes, is part of normal price action as nothing goes up forever in a straight line. This morning,  (NASDAQ:) is making sure the rally stalls as it’s falling on its earnings headline.Source: Shutterstock
	WDC stock is putting pressure on the whole sector. This comes after last week’s negative reaction to the  (NASDAQ:) earnings.The main concern for the bulls is that last week’s highs may have marked the top for the sector for a while. I doubt it is the case as this will turn out to be a reset effort from the bulls.Wall Street has a habit of overshooting in one direction then the other. In this case, the chip sector received too much love from investors so it was inevitable for the trend to reverse a bit to gather more steam. The important part is that this doesn’t turn into a full-blown correction.So is this dip in WDC off its earnings a buying opportunity? Not yet.Before you send me hate mail, this is not a condemnation of the company’s prospects but rather an evaluation of the short-term stock action. In fact, I don’t believe that the negative reaction today changes the thesis. I merely believe that there is no rush to buy the dip in WDC today.Last night, Western Digital management reported earnings and they badly missed the mark. Investors hated what they saw, so they sold WDC stock down 6% on the headline. Management did not seem worried but that’s not what investors heard so they sell now and ask questions later.The good news is that WDC stock just capped a 65% rally off the December bottom, so it has some room to give back without creating additional technical damage.Fundamentally, Western Digital is not cheap as it sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18X. While this sounds low in absolute terms, it’s high relative to the sector.  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) sell at P/E’s less than 5X and  (NASDAQ:) at a P/E of 11X.So while the drop in WDC will eventually turn out to be a buying opportunity, I’d rather avoid this falling knife now. The chip sector tends to trade in unison, yet WDC stock continues to lag.For the past two years, while the SMH and stocks like MU,  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) are up 40% to 70%, WDC is down almost 50% for the same period. So, clearly, to catch this falling knife, I’d rather do it by proxy. Meaning, I’d rather go long the SMH ETF or another stock like  (NASDAQ:).There is no need to be a hero and try to catch WDC, which cannot get above $55 per share. This has been strong resistance ever since the October earnings, and this was a giant ledge that is not likely to be easy to recoup. Management will need to give investors a tangible reason to break through it.Meanwhile, the first order of business for the WDC bulls is to hold the support.The area around $45 per share has been a point of interest for over a year. This means that it will be where bulls and bears already agree on price so they will fight it out hard. This congestion in pricing will act as support on this dip. If the bears prevail then WDC could target $38 per share next. While this is not a forecast, it is a scenario that the bulls need to know exists.But here is the best news of all. This same exact scenario happened three years ago when the stock fell from $110 per share and bottomed behind strong support from the $45 point of interest zone.What followed was a massive rally back up to $100. While we cannot expect the exact scenario to happen this time, it does suggest that if you arealready long Western Digital stock, you should wait out the current battle.As far as going long WDC to catch the rally, I bet that if WDC is spiking, then so is the whole sector. And if you ask me, there are simply better names to own.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"'s   Google has opened up another front in the U.S.-China trade war.Following the Trump administration's executive order last Wednesday to blacklist Huawei, China's leading smartphone maker, Google and chipmakers including  , , , and   are blocking the handset maker from using key software and components.In the latest sign that  between the U.S. and China show no signs of ebbing, President Trump said that Huawei and its affiliates posed a risk to U.S. national security and that it was banned from buying parts and technology from U.S. companies. Now, Google has suspended its business activity with Huawei, the world's No. 2 smartphone maker and biggest maker of telecommunications equipment. This means it will no longer transfer hardware, software, and services that are not already publicly available through its open sourcing license, according to Reuters.  Image source: Getty Images.The suspension could effectively cripple sales of Huawei phones outside of China. Google's move means that existing Huawei phones won't be able to run any updates to the Google-owned Android operating system it uses. Future Huawei phones will no longer have access to Google Play, the company's equivalent to 's App Store, and popular apps like Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube. Current Huawei users will still be able to use Google Play and Google's other apps, so the effect will be strongest on future sales. In Europe, Huawei's second-biggest market, sales could be devastated, as many of Google's products have leading market share on the continent. The privately held Huawei generated $107 billion in revenue last year, up 19.5% year over year, as the company has made great strides to improve its technology, especially its camera. Huawei had been hoping to take the top spot in smartphone sales from by the end of the year, but that seems unlikely after today's news, especially if the ban holds.The blacklist on Huawei from using American semiconductor companies is also likely to send shockwaves through the industry and puts Huawei's future into question. Just last year, Huawei bought $11 billion in chips from American companies. Foreign companies are also banned from selling chips with U.S. components to Huawei. Huawei itself, however, was unperturbed, as management said the chip ban would have limited effects. The company maintained its sales forecast for the year of under 20% growth, according to Though the news clearly threatens Huawei the most, investors weren't keen on the impact on American companies, either. Alphabet stock was down 2.1% on the news, while Qualcomm, which counts on China for two-thirds of its sales, was down 5.3% in afternoon trading. This follows a slide last week after the new U.S. policy was announced. Other chipmakers were down several points as well. The tech-heavy  was off more than 1% Monday.For chipmakers, the impact of the ban is rather direct. For Alphabet, the move could have a modest impact on its advertising and app business. It could drive some potential smartphone buyers to purchase an iPhone, though it seems more likely that they'd replace a Huawei device with another Android-based phone.This is not the first time Huawei has been a flashpoint for international conflict. The U.S. had previously accused the company of stealing trade secrets. As early as 2012, government officials said Huawei and fellow Chinese smartphone-maker ZTE posed a security risk. Several countries have recently expressed security concerns about the company, and earlier this year, Germany considered banning it from its next-gen telecommunications network.Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada last December at the , accused of fraud in relation to U.S. sanctions on Iran, further inflaming tensions. The U.S. and others think that China is using Huawei as a Trojan Horse to steal technology, though Beijing has vigorously denied such claims.   Now, the Trump administration seems to see the Huawei blacklist as a way to strengthen its negotiating position and crack down on China's technological espionage.At this point, there may be no easy resolution to the Huawei ban or the greater trade war, as both countries have  on each other in recent weeks. Huawei's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, has also denied that his company has spied on behalf of the Chinese government, saying in January, ""No law requires any company in China to install mandatory back doors.

he deployment of  wireless networks has    stock in recent months as the market has rewarded the chipmaker's impressive financial growth.But a closer look at Xilinx's recently released fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter results reveals that there's another catalyst that investors shouldn't ignore: automotive growth.Image Source: Getty Images.Xilinx's automotive, broadcast, and consumer segment supplied 14% of its total revenue in the most recent quarter. Though this is not as big as the 41% contribution from the communications segment, which is on a roll thanks to 5G, there's massive potential that cannot be missed.The automotive business grew in the double digits in the latest fiscal year, according to the company. Demand for Xilinx's chips increased because of their ability to power advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Xilinx said its programmable chips are powering ADAS modules at 16 automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).In fact, Xilinx's chips have already been shipped in around 100 million devices in the automotive and transportation space. That number should only expand, as demand for chips that power ADAS is set to increase. Grand View Research estimates that the ADAS market will clock a compound annual growth rate of 19% through 2025 as more cars with this feature hit the road.The company has already struck relationships with key automotive companies and component suppliers to ensure that it doesn't miss out on the ADAS gravy train. Daimler has already showcased an artificial-intelligence-enabled Mercedes SUV that's powered by Xilinx's solutions.ZF is collaborating with Xilinx to develop an AI-based automotive computer -- ZF ProAI -- that will help automakers deploy self-driving applications. ZF has chosen to partner with Xilinx because the programmable nature of its chips will help create a platform that can be tailored according to the needs of different customers.Instead of developing an autonomous driving system from scratch, ZF and Xilinx's modular hardware and open-source software architecture will allow automakers to scale and customize the systems. The two companies believe that such an approach will help reduce costs without limiting the functionality of ZF ProAI.Meanwhile, Chinese car company BYD is mass-producing a camera-based ADAS solution using Xilinx's chips.Xilinx is pulling the right strings to keep its automotive growth engine humming. But more importantly, the company is taking steps to ensure that it doesn't lose its competitive edge in the automotive market, as its product development moves show.Xilinx unveiled its Versal chip in October last year, which it calls the industry's first adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP). The chipmaker claims that this platform is far better than its existing programmable chips, promising a 20x performance jump over the current FPGA chips and a 100x increase over existing CPU applications in the fields of 5G wireless, ADAS, and data centers.Xilinx expects to launch Versal shortly. According to CEO Victor Peng on the company's latest :We're actually only short weeks away from getting the silicon in-house. So we're really excited about that. We have multiple early customer engagements across multiple markets. That does include communications, includes automotive for autonomous driving ... it's pretty broad.So Versal should be able to boost Xilinx's business across several markets thanks to the performance gains it promises to deliver to customers in markets including automotive.We have already seen that the chipmaker is sitting on a massive opportunity in automotive ADAS, and has already struck relationships with key players. The launch of a more powerful chip could help Xilinx cement those partnerships further and score more customers in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"all Street    stock after the company's recent earnings report for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, overlooking its terrific top- and bottom-line growth, which is being driven by the deployment of  wireless networks.Xilinx's revenue jumped 30% year over year to $828 million in the fourth quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. Adjusted earnings per share shot up 34% to $0.94: roughly in line with what analysts were looking for. What's more, the midpoint of Xilinx's first-quarter revenue guidance of $835 million to $865 million was well ahead of the $841 million analyst estimate.Despite these solid results, a pair of Wall Street analysts downgraded Xilinx after the earnings report, hurting investor sentiment and causing the stock price to sink. But this could be an opportunity for investors to buy more Xilinx stock, since the 5G catalyst that's driving its results is just getting started.Image Source: Getty Images.Revenue in Xilinx's communications business shot up a whopping 74% year over year last quarter, thanks to 5G deployments, which kicked off earlier than the company had expected. This segment accounted for 41% of Xilinx's total revenue in the fourth quarter.Following the initial deployments in South Korea, demand for Xilinx's chips is growing, as 5G deployments accelerate in more regions across the globe. This will result in higher infrastructure spending and expand Xilinx's addressable market. IDC, for instance, estimates that the market for 5G network infrastructure will be worth $26 billion in 2022, up from just $528 million in 2018.Unsurprisingly, Xilinx is preparing to take advantage of the potential growth by expanding its chip offerings to address the requirements of 5G. The company's radio frequency (RF) system-on-chip (SoC) portfolio now supports the entire sub-6-gigahertz (GHz) spectrum, which is a critical requirement for 5G deployment.Such product development moves should help Xilinx land more 5G content. That's because 5G networks require more radios as compared with 4G, creating a bigger end-market opportunity for Xilinx. Xilinx executives said on a  that they are witnessing ""more than our typical share of baseband revenues in this very early phase of 5G deployment.""The company has created a product road map to ensure that its 5G catalyst lasts for a long time, as the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that Xilinx makes  by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).This is because FPGAs are off-the-shelf chips that are programmed and reprogrammed by developers until a set standard is developed. FPGAs allow developers to make tweaks and conduct tests to find the optimum configuration. But once the standards are set, FPGAs typically are replaced by custom chips specific to that application. This is a problem that Xilinx is trying to overcome.Xilinx's Versal adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP), for instance, could keep boosting the company's revenue into the later stages of 5G deployment. Unlike Xilinx's earlier chips that could only be programmed at the software level, the Versal platform can be  as well.So Xilinx can make 5G-specific chips that will compete against ASICs in the future, ensuring that the company's 5G catalyst lasts for a long time.Xilinx stock's latest crash has made it relatively cheap. The stock now trades at 34 times last year's earnings, compared with a trailing  (P/E) ratio of around 40 before the earnings were out.Xilinx Price-to-Earnings Ratio (TTM), data by . TTM = trailing 12 months.Also, investors shouldn't miss the fact that Xilinx's earnings should continue to rise in the future, as evident from a forward P/E ratio of about 26. Analysts expect Xilinx to clock double-digit earnings growth over the next two years.As such, now is a good time to take advantage of the recent crash in Xilinx stock. The proliferation of 5G networks could create substantial upside in the long run.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indexes set new record highs on Tuesday, as first-quarter earnings continued to exceed low expectations this week. The rally this week completed a sharp 25% comeback in the S&P 500 that started when U.S. markets bottomed during the last week of December.   There was strong economic data reported in the U.S. this week, highlighted by a blowout first-quarter GDP reading on Friday. We experienced 3.2% growth in the domestic economy last quarter, which smashed the estimate of 2.5%.New home sales were another beacon of light on Tuesday, showing a 3% increase for March. The print exceeded expectations and marked the highest level in 17 months.78% of companies in the S&P 500 have exceeded profits expectations so far this quarter, which is above the historical average. The best growth has been from the financial sector, while energy names have been a drag on overall growth.While estimates going into earnings season called for overall profits to fall 3% to 4% this quarter, the above-average aEURoebeat rateaEUR now has many strategists calling for fractional earnings growth in the first quarter.Quarterly Reports Driving Big MovesXilinx (XLNX) was a big earnings-related loser this week, falling 17% a day after missing profit expectations. 3M (MMM) also lost 13% following its own earnings miss and guidance cut. 3MaEURtms decline single-handedly hit the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than 190 points on Thursday.On the other hand, Twitter (TWTR) and Hasbro (HAS) gained 15% and 14% respectively, the day after posting strong quarterly results this week.As busy as this week was for earnings reports, even more S&P 500 companies are scheduled to announce results next week, highlighted by the following names:   FOMC and Jobs On DeckOn the economic front next week, weaEURtmll get the next interest rate decision from the FOMC on May 1. A ThereaEURtms no change in interest rates expected this time around, but Fed funds futures continue to price in a 57% probability of a rate cut before the end of the year.

Elsewhere, trade talks between the U.S. and China are expected to resume in Beijing next week.U.S. stocks are back up at record highs, having rebounded 25% from the December lows, as some economic measures are running red hot. At the same time, earnings have been coming in ahead of expectations this quarter, but are on track for a flattish result at best.This environment creates a lot of questions for investors:Namely, whataEURtms left to buy now?If I put cash to work here, how do I avoid landmines like 3M and Xilinx that lost as much in one day this week, as they pay in several years of dividends?On the other side of the coin, is 2019 a year that we should simply aEURoesell in May and go away?aEURFortunately, thereaEURtms a better way:My colleague Brett Owens has devised a strategy that removes the worry of trying to time the market.

hares of   in the weeks after the company's fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter report. Investors reacted poorly to the numbers (they were good numbers), and an escalating trade war between Washington, D.C., and Beijing hasn't helped. However, Xilinx and its portfolio of field programmable semiconductors are still growing fast, and the trend doesn't look to be slowing down much with artificial intelligence-powered data centers, edge computing, and mobile 5G networks picking up steam. Trade war or not, this chipmaker should be just fine.There was a lot to like in Xilinx's . Revenue was up 30%, leading to a 34% rise in earnings adjusted for one-time items. It capped off a fantastic year for the company as multiple tailwinds in the auto industry, 5G, and data centers continued to fill its sails and propel business higher. Demand for Xilinx's specialized chips led to another year of exceptionally high gross margin -- especially for the semiconductor industry -- on product sold.P.p. = percentage point. Data source: Xilinx. As operations grew, expenses were kept in check. The biggest reason for the 11% increase in operating expenses was research and development, which was up 16% to $743 million. With Xilinx selling to new and emerging markets, though, that is to be expected as the company continues to make advances in its technology to stay ahead of the pack. Either way, high profit margins and slow growth in expenses led to even faster growth on the bottom line. At the time of the report, management was feeling pretty confident that another good year was in the cards. Revenue in the first quarter of the new fiscal year is expected to be up 24% at the midpoint, and adjusted earnings using  should yield around a 30% annual increase. Additionally, it was also announced that private outfit Solarflare is being acquired to advance Xilinx's field programmable chips and related tech. That deal should close sometime in the second quarter. Image source: Getty Images.As good as the numbers were, all of the forecasts Xilinx gave were prior to notable developments in the . The U.S. and China exchanged a couple of tariff hikes on each other, and the White House also issued an executive order restricting American companies from doing business with Chinese tech giant Huawei.  are being granted for some businesses that sell to Huawei, but the political drama could nonetheless dent Xilinx.That's significant for two reasons: Huawei is a communications juggernaut, and over a third of Xilinx's revenue came from the communications industry. Moreover, the Asia-Pacific region was where nearly half of the company's revenue was derived last year. Circumventing both Huawei and tariffs could present a challenge, to say the least. No matter how the economic back-and-forth plays out, Xilinx should be OK. It says its serviceable market is expected to grow 16% a year through 2024, increasing from about $15 billion now to $28 billion. Data centers and wireless networks should lead the way higher, but the auto industry and industrial usage of chips could grow in the high single digits, too. Tariffs and a ban on a single company won't completely contain that market explosion. Thus, Xilinx could continue to grow via an expanding marketplace for its solutions, and has the potential to sop up more market share along the way. The stock is priced for fast expansion; trailing-12-month price to free cash flow is 26.8, and one-year forward earnings per share is 22.7. Nevertheless, if the company continues to deliver double-digit top- and bottom-line results, that isn't an outrageous price to pay. The only caveat is the trade war. Expect more volatility ahead until a resolution is (eventually, hopefully) sorted out.

"he following are today's upgrades for Validea's  model based on the published strategy of . This strategy looks for firms with persistent earnings growth that trade at a discount relative to their earnings growth and dividend yield.XILINX, INC. (XLNX) is a large-cap growth stock in the Semiconductors industry. The rating according to our strategy based on John Neff changed from 60% to 79% based on the firm’s underlying fundamentals and the stock’s valuation. A score of 80% or above typically indicates that the strategy has some interest in the stock and a score above 90% typically indicates strong interest.Company Description: Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) is engaged in designing and developing programmable devices and associated technologies. The Company's programmable devices and associated technologies include integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of programmable logic devices (PLDs), including programmable System on Chips (SoCs) and three-dimensional ICs (3D ICs); software design tools to program the PLDs; targeted reference designs; printed circuit boards, and intellectual property (IP), which consists of Xilinx, and various third-party verification and IP cores. The Company provides design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Its PLDs include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that its customers program to perform desired logic functions, and programmable SoCs, which combine (Advanced reduced instruction set computing (RISC) Machines (ARM)) processor-based systems with programmable logic in a single device.The following table summarizes whether the stock meets each of this strategy's tests. Not all criteria in the below table receive equal weighting or are independent, but the table provides a brief overview of the strong and weak points of the security in the context of the strategy's criteria.For a full detailed analysis using NASDAQ's Guru Analysis tool, Since its inception, Validea's strategy based on John Neff has returned 141.16% vs. 165.50% for the S&P 500. For more details on this strategy, About John Neff: While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as ""relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative."" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.About Validea: Validea is an  service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

" (NASDAQ:) reported earnings last night and Wall Street hated what they saw, sending Intel stock fell down 8% on the headline.Source: Shutterstock
	This reaction resembles that of  (NASDAQ:), which collapsed 16% on its earnings headline. They both came into the events with lofty expectations.The actual metrics were not a disaster for INTC as they met or barely beat most expectations. Except that they committed the cardinal sin and guided much lower going forward. Traders are consistent in selling any headline that reduces future results, regardless of the quality of the current report card.It doesn’t help that INTC’s CEO cited a dramatic slowdown in China. These are comments to scare an entire sector, but I think in this case, it’s probably more INTC’s specific issues than system-wide problems.To add to the confusion, INTC management said they are expecting better conditions in the second half. This is in direct conflict with them lowering guidance. So maybe they are managing expectations lower so they can have an easy beat next quarter. This is the UPOD tactic, where they under promise and over deliver.Even if that were true, it would be difficult for them to have a turnaround this year. It would require a very steep reverse ramp and, to me, that requires far too much hopium to make Intel stock worth a gamble.I also question the logic behind INTC exiting the race for 5G before it even starts. Management cited that they did so because of the deal between  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:).This by itself is not a reason to short Intel stock, but it is a sure sign that they need to regroup to find the next hot venue to come. Until then, I’d classify the stock as a trading vehicle and not a place to park money for the long term. For that, there are better companies.For example, I’d rather bet on a proven winner like  (NASDAQ:), who actually had a huge up year in 2018 when the whole market struggled. If INTC stock rallies then so will AMD. Or sit it out for a few days until the dust settles. In fact, this morning, AMD is holding best in its sector on the INTC dip.There is value in Intel stock as it sells at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 13. This is cheap in absolute terms and especially cheap compared to AMD’s P/E of 85. But INTC historically lags in value. So in a sense, it’s expensive against itself. This would make buying it now a potential value trap. Besides, the stock just came off a two-decade high.Meanwhile, there are important levels below its current levels. INTC stock is falling into its first area of support which has been in contention since January 2018.In February, INTC stock broke out in force from $52 per share. It has since served as support at least once and it should do it again. For the bears to break through it they would need the help of a falling market in general. If it fails, there is another pivotal level around $48 per share, which will also provide even stronger support.The good news is that this area is very magnetic. So if I am already long INTC stock, I can hold it to see how the price action unfolds over the next few days.But a candle this big is not usually a one-day event so it deserves respect … it’s not a great starting point to catch the falling knife on the first tick down.Furthermore the whole sector is under fire from the experts in the media. Their rhetoric has been particularly negative, especially after the hideous reaction to the earnings report from  (NASDAQ:).And there is risk from the whole market being near all-time highs. Most bulls will have one foot out the door, so in essence, the market is in weak hands for a few days.In summary, Intel is a decent company but it needs to give investors better reasons to get excited. For now, there are better bets in the sector.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of . As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"ne of the hotter tech trends today is the migration to 5G wireless networks. It has been quite a big topic recently, with many of the leading wireless carriers rolling out early incarnations of 5G in select locations around the U.S.Or have they?At first, 5G may not seem like such a big deal -- it's an upgrade in terms of both speed and latency for wireless networks, but you might think that your phone is fast enough. However, the implications of 5G, if its purveyors are correct, are much bigger. High-grade 5G networks are thought to be a key enabler of  such as virtual reality, 4K HD streaming, automation for the Internet of Things, and even self-driving cars. It could also potentially provide more competition for wireline broadband providers. There are also likely other applications and business models that don't even exist yet, but could be enabled by 5G.Yet as it stands today, 5G is mostly hype, and likely will be for at least the next several years. Here's why.5G: Real deal or all hype? Image source: Getty Images.Most of the big service providers in the U.S., including  ,  , and   have been building out their 5G network trials in select cities. However, there have been reports of unforeseen difficulties in these initial rollouts.This isn't just one problem, but several, and solving one complication often causes another to pop up, like a game of whack-a-mole. Here are just a few of the bigger headaches that have recently been reported.5G networks can achieve such lightning-fast speeds because they use mmWave spectrum, or high-frequency spectrum. This allows for higher speeds, but these waves don't go very far from the base station, and they have trouble penetrating walls and human bodies.Current trials going on in Vancouver, British Columbia, have found that service providers need to install way more base stations in order to achieve any notable difference over 4G. While initial estimates were for about four to nine times the amount of base stations, the Vancouver trials show 5G may require something more like the number of base stations as 4G.That would make initial investment much higher than thought, which could make 5G more expensive, and thus less used. It also wouldn't be practical to install except in extremely dense urban environments, where one could get more subscribers in a relatively small area. The suburbs and rural communities are likely out of luck. So, service providers could very well end up spending far more for fewer 5G subscribers, leading to dis-economies of scale.In addition to needing far more real estate on which to plunk base stations, even if a good location is found, current 5G base stations are much heavier than 4G base stations. Steve Douglas, a 5G consultant who runs the aforementioned Vancouver trials, revealed that often these base station radios can break roofs or mounting poles. Therefore, a successful implementation may require reinforcing a building -- another added cost that probably wasn't contemplated by the large carriers.Another problem with 5G doesn't come from the network side, but rather on the receiving end with early 5G handsets. We are currently seeing the rollout of the first ""5G""-capable phones from the likes of  , Huawei,  , and others, but are these phones ready for 5G prime time?The problem? There's too much going on in these phones; 5G requires multiple antennas, which makes it difficult to fit everything in the phone in a space-efficient way. In addition, early handsets are experiencing interference among the different signals going in and out of the phone. For instance, the large MIMO antennas on 5G handsets have been shown to interfere with the device's GPS signal, leading to a degradation in performance and thus the whole premise of 5G.Though many of the leading wireless carriers in the U.S. are currently touting their ""5G"" networks that have just recently been turned on, let's be clear: This isn't really 5G. The current problems listed above are just a few in a long line of complications, and others are likely to arise.But don't just take my word for it. Craig Moffett of telecom research firm MoffettNathanson said there is ""zero chance"" 5G will become ubiquitous by 2021.  CoBank, which lends to rural telecom providers, estimates only 15% potential 5G market penetration...by 2025, a full six years from now.So why are you hearing so much about 5G from the likes of AT&T and others? Mainly because carriers like AT&T are using ""5G Evolution"" branding for something that's actually just a premium version of 4G, and not that transformative. In fact,   just filed a lawsuit against AT&T because its marketing could potentially give 5G such a bad name.Sprint's , T-Mobile, also recently got into the game, with a  that basically destroyed Verizon's new $10-per-month 5G upgrade in Chicago and Minneapolis as spotty, unreliable, and a ""rush job."" T-Mobile suggests that mmWave spectrum isn't sufficient for large swaths of the country, and that it will be rolling out ""real"" 5G in the future on a combination of mmWave, midband 2.5 GHz spectrum, and low-end 600 MHz spectrum. I'm still not sure how one can promise the speeds of 5G on mid- and low-band spectrum either, so even the ""skeptic"" T-Mobile has explaining to do as well.The takeaway is this: Don't buy stocks today based solely on 5G mania. I do think that the service providers will invest heavily in the technology -- after all, they appear to have hyped themselves into a corner. Therefore, some of the 5G chipmakers such as   or   could do well. But will 5G lead to a scalable, profitable business for service providers? I'm not seeing it, at least not for another decade.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"hursday was another mixed day on Wall Street, with a balanced helping of good and bad earnings reports among the dozens of companies that announced their latest results. Investors are seeing the highest flow of quarterly reports so far this earnings season, and how major benchmarks performed today depended in large part on which parts of the market each particular index stressed. There were some high-profile stocks that posted sizable losses following disappointing earnings news, and , , and  were among the worst performers. Here's why they did so poorly.Shares of 3M plunged 13% after the maker of Post-it notes gave a financial report for the first quarter that resulted in the stock's biggest loss since the 1987 market crash. Revenue at 3M was down 5% from year-earlier levels, contributing to an 11% drop in adjusted earnings per share. CEO Mike Roman called the results ""a disappointing start to the year for 3M,"" attributing the shortfall to poor conditions in key end markets and subpar operational execution. In response, the conglomerate will restructure in an effort to improve productivity, cut expenses, and boost cash flow. Yet many investors don't seem convinced that the moves will be enough to create meaningful change at 3M, and  suggests that there could be more pain in the short run before things get better for the company.Image source: 3M. following the release of its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results. The chipmaker said that revenue was up 30% for the quarter compared to the year-earlier period, resulting in a 34% jump in adjusted earnings per share over the same time frame. CEO Victor Peng celebrated the end of a successful fiscal year for the company, pointing to particularly strong success in its advanced product business. Growth rates were highest in the Asia-Pacific region and in the communications end market. Yet investors had wanted to see signs of faster growth, especially in light of even better performance from some of its peers. Xilinx is hopeful it can tap into the growth potential of 5G, but shareholders fear that competition will be fierce.Finally, shares of . The cigarette giant said that adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019 fell 5% from the year-earlier period, driven by a nearly 8% drop in revenue. Domestic cigarette shipment volume plunged 14%, led lower by a more than 3 billion unit drop in shipments of Altria's key Marlboro brand. Rising gas prices weighed on consumer purchases, leading Altria to project an even larger full-year volume drop than previously anticipated. The tobacco titan expects to implement cost-saving measures to try to improve profits, but investors don't seem confident that Altria will be able to meet its 2019 guidance -- or that recent investments in e-cigarette company Juul or cannabis producer will pay off.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

"any companies seemingly can't stop talking about 5G wireless. The technology promises significant improvements compared to 4G LTE, including improvements in peak transfer speeds as well as potentially dramatic improvements in latency, the latter of which could be very helpful in latency-sensitive applications like multiplayer gaming. For consumers, the eventual transition to  should be a win, ushering in better mobile experiences and, potentially, accelerating the viability of many  (IoT) applications. For investors in companies with exposure to that transition, it could mean fatter profits. Here are three chip companies set to profit from the industrywide move to 5G: , , and .Image source: Skyworks.Xilinx builds chips known as field programmable gate arrays or FPGAs. These chips, in contrast to most others, can be reconfigured on the fly to perform different functions depending on the user's needs. While FPGAs aren't the ideal solution for workloads that don't change much, they're very useful in situations where workloads are constantly changing. FPGAs are commonly used in communications infrastructure -- revenue from such applications made up 35%, 35%, and 33% of Xilinx's revenue in each of the first three quarters of its current fiscal year respectively -- so it's not surprising that the company is poised to profit from the 5G transition. Indeed, Xilinx CEO Victor Peng said on the company's most recent  that it's ""seeing strong growth from the very early production 5G and pre-5G deployments, as well as some LTE upgrades"" and that ""[the] strong growth was primarily driven by 5G deployments in South Korea and a very early start of the ramp of 5G deployments in China.""Considering that the industry is still in the early innings of that 5G build-out, Xilinx looks poised to profit as that transition continues in the quarters and years ahead. Another company set to benefit from the move to 5G is Broadcom.A significant part of Broadcom's wireless revenue -- the company's wireless chip business is an important part of its overall semiconductor business -- comes from the sale of radio frequency (RF) chips based on its . A key part of Broadcom's wireless growth story over the years is that as smartphone wireless subsystems have become increasingly complex, it has been able to sell correspondingly more capable FBAR chips into those devices, allowing it to boost its per-chip average selling prices and, ultimately, its revenue. On the company's most recent , CEO Hock Tan explained that the 5G transition could drive ""quite significant"" FBAR content increases. The caveat, though, is that Broadcom isn't expecting a significant impact until beyond 2020, with, perhaps, a slight impact in 2020.Now, the good news for Broadcom is that while it's not expecting the 5G transition to hit in full force until sometime after 2020, it's still expecting both dollar content gains as well as share gains in the iPhones that is expected to launch later this year. Apple is by far Broadcom's largest wireless customer, making up roughly 80% of the latter's wireless revenue in its fiscal 2018, so Broadcom investors don't have to wait for 5G to arrive for the company's wireless business to return to growth.Wireless chip company Skyworks also generally benefits from the move to more advanced wireless standards as such transitions drive up the amount of dollar content it sells into smartphones. The 5G transition -- as well as subsequent enhancements to 5G that are bound to roll out over time -- should enable a solid dollar content increase in smartphones for Skyworks.What's also important to understand is that Skyworks is looking to . The company has cited areas like automotive, smart cities, and industrial IoT as markets into which it could sell wireless chips. While these markets already exist without 5G, a commonly held view is that the introduction of 5G will help make these types of IoT applications more mainstream.So whether we're looking at Skyworks' core smartphone chip business or its growth opportunities beyond smartphones, the company looks set to benefit from the proliferation of 5G in the coming years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

emiconductor stocks had a hard time toward the end of 2018, but they have gotten off to a flying start this year. This is clearly evident from the impressive gains clocked by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index so far in 2019.NVIDIA and Xilinx Year-to-Date Stock Performance vs. PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, data by  .The positive sentiment has rubbed off nicely on the likes of  (NASDAQ: NVDA) and  (NASDAQ: XLNX) : two chipmakers that have been in the news in recent months for reasons both good and bad. Though NVIDIA has  in the aftermath of the cryptocurrency bust -- and the company has warned that it is in for a difficult year -- shareholders seem upbeat.Xilinx, meanwhile, has taken off, thanks to a diverse set of catalysts that have positively impacted its  . Its programmable chips are in great demand on the back of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled data centers. So, Xilinx's rally seems justified when compared with NVIDIA's.But is that enough to make Xilinx a better bet than NVIDIA? Let's find out.Image Source: Getty ImagesNVIDIA is having a terrible time right now because its gaming hardware business has taken a big hit due to an oversupply of graphics cards. The gaming segment's revenue crashed 45% year over year during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, dealing a body blow to NVIDIA's top and bottom lines, as it accounts for nearly half of the company's sales.Also, sales in NVIDIA's OEM and intellectual property segment, which includes sales of graphics cards for cryptocurrency mining purposes, fell 36% year over year. NVIDIA doesn't have a way of identifying if the graphics cards it sells are used for gaming or mining by the end user. So, there's a possibility that some of the graphics card sales included in the gaming segment actually went to cryptocurrency miners.Once the cryptocurrency mining wave died, graphics card prices crashed as demand fizzled out. Retailers were left with excess graphics card supply, and they are busy working through that glut. As a result, graphics card demand is weak.NVIDIA is witnessing weaker-than-anticipated sales of its latest-generation graphics cards, although it believes that the market will hit bottom in the current quarter. But even if that happens, NVIDIA's outlook for the year indicates that it will struggle to attain the kind of rapid growth that investors grew used to in recent years.The company expects full-year revenue to be flat in fiscal 2020, though investors can take heart that it anticipates a major comeback after a projected 31% year-over-year sales decline in the current quarter. However, NVIDIA may find it difficult to walk the talk, since rival  ' product development moves could help the latter  in the gaming and data center markets.In my opinion, investors should wait for concrete signs of a turnaround at NVIDIA before buying into the stock. The market isn't likely to take a lenient view the next time its results and guidance fall below expectations, so it's better to be safe than sorry.Xilinx has stepped into the limelight big-time in recent quarters because of the utility of its programmable chips. The company's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are  by the likes of  and  to power their AI-enabled cloud computing applications. Also, Xilinx's chips are being used in smart memory drives meant to enhance computing speeds in data centers.But the hottest catalyst for Xilinx right now is 5G wireless connectivity. The company's communications revenue shot up 41% year over year last quarter, thanks to its early 5G deployments. Telecom customers  to buy Xilinx's FPGAs because they can be configured after being purchased, allowing network operators to make any tweaks or updates easily during the initial rollout phase.This creates a massive opportunity for Xilinx, since more telecom operators can be expected to opt for its programmable chips once 5G network deployments gather steam globally. IDC estimates that 5G infrastructure investments will jump from $528 million last year to $26 billion in 2022, indicating healthy demand for Xilinx's programmable chips.More importantly, Xilinx is future-proofing its 5G opportunity by integrating additional features into its 5G chip platform. The company is trying to ensure that its offerings remain relevant even when application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) meant specifically for 5G infrastructure hit the market.The chipmaker says that its 5G chip platform can reduce the power consumption and size of the system by 50% to 75%, thanks to the integration of digital, analog, and embedded software into a single design.Meanwhile, FPGA demand in data centers is expected to increase at a rapid pace. According to Research and Markets, demand for data center accelerator chips, such as central processing units, graphics cards, FPGAs, and ASICs, is expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 50% through 2023, when the market will be worth $21 billion.Of these types of chips, demand for FPGAs is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period because they are expected to play an important role in accelerating enterprise workloads. Xilinx is in the pole position to take advantage of this opportunity because it  .Xilinx's business is on the rise while NVIDIA's is waning.NVIDIA vs. Xilinx Revenue and Net Income (Quarterly), data by  .However, investors looking to take advantage of Xilinx's growth will have to pay a premium, as the stock trades at almost 40 times the company's current-year earnings. NVIDIA is cheaper, with a trailing  (P/E) ratio of less than 29. But Xilinx's premium seems justified because of its superior growth rate. Also, the company enjoys a clear path to success, as it leads the fast-growing FPGA market, while NVIDIA is trying to overcome its recent slump in the face of tough competition from AMD.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 31st expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new May 31st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.21.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $113.79 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $134.09/share today.

Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 14% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 89%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.05% return on the cash commitment, or 8.35% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.


Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $115.00 strike is located relative to that history:


   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.09.  If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $134.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $150.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.42% if the stock gets called away at the May 31st expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $150.00 strike highlighted in red:



   
Considering the fact that the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 12% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 77%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.56% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.37% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.


The implied volatility in the put contract example is 44%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 40%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $134.09) to be 38%.

"hings are about to get really interesting.Artificial intelligence has already . Companies are using   graphics processing units,   , or their own customized chips to train machine-learning models to recognize a variety of different inputs. This method of training neural networks is the technical reason  autonomous cars can recognize stop signs and  social network can recognize faces. But we're reaching an exciting and strange new era, which is based on a process called machine-learning inference. Different than training, inference involves computers taking everything we've taught them to produce something entirely new.Artificial intelligence is gaining traction globally. Image source: Getty Images.Take  as an example. It shows high-resolution pictures of normal-looking people, who could easily be your coworkers or live next door.But the catch is, none of these people actually exist. Each of the pictures is fake, artificially created by a generative adversarial network that has been trained on what eyes, noses, and hair tend to look like. AI has created something on its own, based on everything we've taught it.This same concept of machine inference is what allows   Duplex , or for   Alexa to proactively make products recommendations for you.Behind the scenes, inference takes a ton of computing horsepower to actually work. Amazon Web Services estimates that inference  up to 90% of the computing costs required for any given application.In other words, we need to innovate computing hardware. We can't just run everything on  central processing units (CPUs) any more, at least without running up a huge electricity bill for all the power consumed. The race is on to design new chips and software ecosystems that can run inference most efficiently. To help us see what the future holds, I recently spoke with   fellow  John Cohn. John has one of the most innovative computing minds on the planet, with more than 116 patents and 36 technical papers to his name after nearly 40 years at one of the world's largest companies.In our conversation at Austin's , John discusses why and how artificial intelligence became so popular, and the growing role of AI accelerators. He also explains why he is a fan of using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)  for innovation, but of custom silicon chips for higher-volume commercial applications.Our conversation is captured in the following video, with a full transcript also included below.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now. Amazon  -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking. Well let me just say that I'm a big fan of hardware. I came from that. And it's very interesting.When we were talking before about how the cloud was about to take over the world. Well, like many things, the actual truth is somewhere between. There's going to be a rebalancing between local hardware and cloud hardware. On both of those sides, there's going to be a lot of advances in technology. Silicon technology, which is kind of like after Moore's [Law], things were starting to level out.Well there's a lot more work in architecture about acceleration, etc. Like GPUs, TPUs. We just announced a billion-dollar investment in Albany on a group that's actually looking at technology approaches to AI. An accelerator, you're saying -- executing the code more efficiently and quickly? When you say code, you look at a structure like a GPU. GPUs work for AI because in a neural net -- let's say in deep learning -- you're just doing a whole lot of linear algebra. You're doing a whole bunch of multipliers. That's basically it. The same thing that makes graphics really smooth for a game actually is just doing a lot of matrix multiplies.So in 2012 when somebody said, ""Hey, let's try using commercial GPUs,"" well, it was a combination of using things like CUDA but then building layers on top of it. Whether it was Pytorch, TensorFlow, Octave, whatever to be able to free you up from the gorp of actually writing the CUDA code yourself. That's when AI and deep learning started to take off.Those accelerators, that's great, except the sort of amount of computation you can do with a certain amount of time and a certain power budget. Because ultimately, you've got to fit it all in the same box. It's getting limited, because GPUs were not designed to do that. Now a lot of companies, including us, are working on more special purpose accelerators, so-called TPUs.But we're even looking beyond that. I'm about to install a hardware cluster at MIT that's about 112 kilowatts. It's a lot of power. Our human brain is about 20 watts when you're sitting there. There's a lot of room to improve.This place in Albany is looking at all sorts of acceleration technology. We're looking at analog technologies. We're looking at phase change memory, MRAM. To be able to do analog computing on these models of neural nets.Not necessarily to run code, linear code, like you would do on a GPU. But to actually do the analog calculation that a neuron model would do in analog. With less precision but a whole lot less power. A whole lot less power can be -- because of parallelism -- can be traded into a whole lot more performance or a whole lot bigger model.Now, you asked about FPGAs. They're different strokes for different folks, right? You've got to figure out what you're trying to do.I'm a huge believer in FPGAs as a technology for doing innovation. One of the keyest things that you need to do is you need -- in that notion of being able to play with something -- you need to be able to make very quick turns of innovation. You need to try some, run real workloads on it, representative set, and then make some changes.  What do you need to make the changes to, though? To the actual architecture. So if you're really trying to optimize power performance -- which is a box -- ""How much performance can I get within a certain power budget?"" That's basically what it's all about. That is tuning. For many years, we just tuned the software and the hardware was what it was. Well we can't really afford to do that now, when the next turn of the crank doesn't give us more performance on hardware. As you said, right?So what we have to do is we have to be able to really co-optimize the software layers and the hardware layers a lot more. Almost like the early days of hardware. Almost when the days when you could count your memory bits. You had to really, really care where every picowatt was going.When you're trying to do that, you create a computation structure like, ""Well do I do that in 64 bits, or do it in 32 bits, or do I even do it in eight bits?"" Certain calculations in image recognition are actually far faster and far more power efficient in lower resolution with the same accuracy. Go figure, right?Well the only way to create a hardware acceleration of that is to be able to radically change the architecture of the accelerator. To do that as a chip cycle, could take many millions of dollars and four months. Or three to six months of making a new chip. Well, you can't really afford to do that. Yeah. FPGAs are a rapid prototyping. I can get near custom hardware performance, but in a day. I can make a change.As a deployment technology -- like if you were going to go make a deep learning thing -- it's a kind of diminishing return. At some point, you spend so much more money and you really get hit for cost, density, and power. That if you've got any sort of volume at all, once you've tuned it in, it makes sense to do a chip. If you have a very small niche, something that you don't need very many of, then the actual complexities -- the cost and risk complexities of actually building a custom chip -- may not be a good idea. If it's very special purpose, ""I'm just recognizing one specific sort of image and I need to accelerate it because I'm doing something real time,"" then an FPGA might make sense. But if you have any sort of volume, I personally think, that you need to go to [a custom chip].What's interesting, too, is that there are hybrids between what's a standard FPGA, which can emulate any sort of logic, and field-programmable combinations of higher functions. You'll see things that are actually higher-level composable units that you could customize, somewhat, but don't have the overhead of making the individual logic units in FPGAs. Best of both worlds. Yeah, and that's kind of a balance. Ultimately, look at something like bitcoin mining. You eventually had to go to -- and I'm not a big fan of bitcoin mining -- but you have to eventually go to a special purpose to stay ahead competitively. The thing that I'm trying to answer, the fundamental question I have, is it seems like all of the cloud companies are now using, or starting to use, FPGAs, right? Machine learning inference as a service. Why are they using FPGAs? For flexibility. You can customize the logic to a workload. I personally believe, as a hardware guy, that that will change. We're just at a new cusp. Where you need that flexibility. The workloads that are happening for inferencing. Things like inferencing are kind of nuanced. When you actually end up in a world where you're doing something like a GAN, generalized adversarial network. What we would call inferencing, actually has a fair bit of forward calculation, computation in it. You need acceleration on the way out. You're not just doing a simple pass forward.Those kind of things are new. We don't know what that hardware should look like. I personally believe that it'll eventually get to a point where we'll be able to choose a couple of classes. It'll eventually be sort of a combination of bigger components and eventually customized silicon. But I'm a silicon guy!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@What Does the Future Hold for Artificial Intelligence?@2019-04-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-does-future-hold-artificial-intelligence-2019-04-12
"Image source: The Motley Fool.  Q4 2019 , Good afternoon. My name is Ian, and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO and Lorenzo Flores, CFO, who will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and fiscal year '19 overall as well as provide the business outlook for the June quarter. Lorenzo will also share some color for how we see our fiscal year '20 ahead of our Analyst and Investor Day where we will provide detailed full year guidance.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the Company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.In addition to GAAP financial measures, we will be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the Company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of nonrecurring and unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisition. We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the Company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website.This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live, it can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very excited to report that we made exceptional progress on our strategy in fiscal 2019. We far surpassing our original revenue goal by delivering over $3 billion of revenue for the first time in our history. This was 24% growth over fiscal 2018. Our growth was broad-based with all our primary end markets up by double digits. We also reached record levels of profitability as non-GAAP EPS increased 32% year-over-year to $3.48 per share.The March quarter continued to see strength as revenue increased 30% year-on-year to $828 million, and non-GAAP EPS was up 34% year-on-year to $0.94 per share. Lorenzo will provide more financial details on both the March quarter and fiscal 2019. So now focus my comments on key accomplishments during the year. We made excellent progress on our transformation to a platform company. First and second generation, zinc product revenue increased approximately 60% with strength and many applications in communications, automotive, particularly ADAS and industrial end markets. We taped out our 7-nanometer Versal ACAP on schedule, which is an industry first. Versal will deliver 10x compute performance and 10x bandwidth and deliver power efficiency for many applications across all of our end markets. We also launched Alveo, a family of powerful, adaptable PCIe accelerator cards that increase the performance of a broad range of applications for both cloud and on-premise deployment. And we also hosted three very successful developers conferences globally that had a record attendance as part of our drive to increase application development and expand our ecosystem.Now, let me share some highlights around our three key growth drivers: communications, data center and automotive. Starting with communications, 5G deployments began earlier than our expectations at the start of FY '19. We were exceptionally well-positioned at this early stage of what's a historic 5G cycle, which we believe will be multiple times larger than 4G. Deployment started in South Korea and now we see deployments gearing up in multiple geographies. We're shipping in volume in radio and baseband applications. Our opportunity in 5G rate is particularly strong because the complexity of the new standard drives the need for significantly more radios that in 4G. We expect to get more content given the higher value we add for radios with products like our RFSoC.In addition, we have a complete product road map with our recently announced expansion of our RFSoC portfolio covering the full sub 6 gigahertz 5G spectrum. We've seen more than our typical share of baseband revenues in this very early phase of 5G deployment. We expect to retain some of the current 5G baseband sockets, while some will be replaced by a ASICs over time. And this is consistent with what we've seen in the past deployments, including 4G and 4.5G. Now when our 7-nanometer Versal ramps the production, we have an opportunity to expand beyond our historical baseband revenue levels in later deployments of 5G.Now moving on the data center, we continue to develop and expand our ecosystem and adaptable platforms in a variety of pipeline applications. We are strengthening our data center first strategy with today's announcement of our intention to acquire Solarflare, a provider of high-performance, low latency networking solutions for multiple applications, including financial. Combining our industry-leading FPGAs, MPSoC and soon ACAP solutions with Solarflare's high-speed NIC technology and onload application acceleration software will create a powerful converged SmartNIC platform. Solarflare's software and networking expertise is an excellent complement to our silicon, IP and development tools leadership.We also continue to fortify Xilinx platform and Alveo partners ecosystem through our corporate ventures initiatives. We nearly doubled the number of companies in our Versal portfolio year-over-year to more than 20 businesses covering multiple applications such as data analytics, financial computing and video streaming acceleration. We increased the cumulative numbers of developers trained on SDAccel development environment over 3,000, and we added over 500 independent software vendors to our ecosystem.Moving onto automotive. First generation Zynq sales grew 40% in fiscal '19, and we saw an expansion of second-generation Zynq MPSoC design wins in the next generation of ADAS systems. We also saw an increase in autonomous driving design wins. And put together all this momentum, we expect to see steady revenue growth well into the next decade. So for example, at the last CES Daimler showcased its AI solution in the new Mercedes GLE Sport Utility Vehicle that's powered by an MPSoC accelerating multiple neural network.In addition, ZF announced a strategic collaboration with Xilinx for all technology will power their highly advanced AI-based automotive control unit to enable automated driving. Another recent milestone was the announcement that BYD will be the first OEM in China to start mass production of its front camera ADAS technology using our Zynq SoCs.So, in summary, we made great progress in establishing strong positions in multiple large and growing markets. The exceptional growth we achieved in FY '19 provides us with great momentum as we enter FY '20. Having established a strong growth trajectory, we believe now is the time for us to optimize our organizational structure to better match our long-term objectives. To that end, we have created two business units to increase our focus and agility in strategic high growth markets. Specifically, we formed the Data Center Group or DCG and the Wired and Wireless Group or WWG, which will be led by Salil Raje and Liam Madden, respectively, reporting to me. Salil and Liam have both held senior leadership positions at Xilinx for over a decade. And for the other core vertical markets, we will retain our functional structure to have the horizontally leverage model for sustained growth but with solid profitability.In addition to organizing for sustained growth, we will increase organic vesting in FY '20 as we execute our 7-nanometer silicon road map, and extend our key IP portfolio, our software stack and our ecosystem. We will also make inorganic investments that are strongly aligned with our strategy and will build lasting shareholder value like our acquisition of DeePhi in FY '19. We'll share more details about our FY '20 plans and our overall strategy at our Analyst Day next month in New York City.Thank you, and I'll turn it now over to Lorenzo. -- Thank you, Victor, and good afternoon to you all. We are all thrilled with the execution and financial results of the Company in FY '19. Xilinx delivered many financial records this past year highlighted first by $3.59 billion (ph) in revenue, a growth of 24% from FY '18. Advanced products which grew over 40% are the key growth driver of our business. They are now 64% of total sales. With double digit growth across all reported end markets, we are demonstrating the durable position our leadership technologies have achieved across the growth areas of our industry.Along with our revenue growth, we maintain strong profitability. Gross margin was 69% for the year and operating margin exceeded 31%. On a dollar basis GAAP operating income grew 40%. This excellent operating performance resulted in record earnings. GAAP EPS was $3.47 up 93%, and non-GAAP EPS was $3.48, up 32% over FY '18. Due to the impact of tax reform on FY '18 GAAP results, the growth of non-GAAP EPS would be more indicative of our financial performance.Moving on to our March quarter. Quarterly revenues were $828 million, growing almost 4% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by communications particularly wireless, as that end market grew 23% sequentially and 74% year-over-year. Industrial and A&D also increased quarter-over-quarter as each end market grew. Data center and TME declined. TME was flat, data center was down, but we expect it will rebound in Q1. Automotive, broadcast and consumer decline the stronger than expected growth in auto was offset by an industry cycle and broadcast.We maintain strong profitability in the quarter as well. Gross margin came in at 67.5% below our guidance due to the higher proportion of wireless in our revenue mix. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were below guidance at $309 million and $300 million, respectively. GAAP operating margin was 30.2% and non-GAAP operating margin was 31.2%. For the quarter, GAAP EPS was $0.95 a share, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.94 a share. EPS growth over our prior Q4 was 70% on a GAAP basis and 34% on a non-GAAP basis. A few highlights on our balance sheet and cash flows.We ended the year with $3.2 billion in gross cash and $1.2 billion in debt after retiring $500 million of debt in the March quarter. We continue to address our accounts receivable and ended the year at 37 days. Inventory increased $32 million to $315 million as we build inventory to support our increasing demand. In FY '19, we returned $526 million to our shareholders through a combination of buyback and dividend. We repurchased $162 million -- $162 million worth of shares or 2.4 million shares at an average price of $66.30, and paid a total of $364 million in dividends.One last achievement to highlight before I move on to guidance. During FY '19, we generated a record of $1.1 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 33% from FY '19 -- FY '18. Revenue growth, rigorous focus on profitability and disciplined management of our working capital all contributed to this outstanding result. Before I move into guidance, I want to elaborate a little bit on what Victor talked about our new organization and our new revenue reporting structure. What we called Communications will now be called Wired and Wireless Group or WWG. Data Center and TME will be split. Data Center Group will now be reported separately and will include high performance computing, although that element has been historically very modest. The remaining end markets, which we will often call core vertical markets will have a grouping of A&D, Industrial and TME called AIT, and the grouping of automotive, broadcast and consumer called ABC.Now onto the guidance. Revenue growth continues in Q1 with the expected revenue between $835 million and $865 million. The key driver of growth will be WWG with both -- with growth in both wired and wireless. Data center is expected to resume double-digit percent growth. We expect AIT will be down meaningfully with declines in A&D and TME, more than offsetting growth industrial. All end markets and ABC are expected to grow. This end market mix in Q1 leads us to forecast gross margin at approximately 66%. In Q1, GAAP operating expense is expected to be $315 million and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be $308 million.Wrapping up our guidance, GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $15 million in Q1 and our tax rate is expected to be between 7% and 9%. While we provide more details on FY '20 and our Analyst and Investor Day, we can provide you now a framework for the remainder of FY '20. In the first half, we expect Q2 revenue and gross margin to be similar Q1 with a modest increase in operating expense. In the second half, we expect to return to growth with strength in data center, aerospace and defense, TME and auto, while other businesses grow modestly or remain steady. The rebalancing of our end market mix is expected to improve our gross margin to more typical levels.Our operating expense will also grow in the second half as we realize the impact of our annual compensation increases across our employee base and increased tape out expenses. After exceptional performance in FY '19, we are headed into FY '20 with a great deal of momentum. We have done far more than deliver one year with great revenue growth and profitability. We have been successful in driving our strategy, expanding our leadership and our market reach and establishing our strength across 5G, data center and automotive.As Victor noted, our accomplishments also include the acquisition of DeePhi and the recent announcement to acquire Solarflare, both bringing talented teams and technologies aligned with our strategy. With these successes, FY '20 is off to a solid start and we are looking forward to growing the Company at double digit rates.With that let me turn the call over to questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. -- Yes, guys. Thanks, let me ask a question. Victor, in your prepared comments you talked about normal comp cycle, FPGAs get a lot of content at the beginning, and then there's some displacement as the build out continues. I'm curious can you help kind of quantify the magnitude or the timing of when you might expect some of the baseband business that you're winning today moving to ASIC stat? -- Yes, thanks. First, I'm glad you modify that with baseband, because radio will going be stronger than ever. And as I said, there going be more radio and we're going to capture more content there. So within the baseband side, again, we historically have always even after ASIC displacement retain some revenue streams from the baseband. But -- and it's very early start at the second half of last year and coming into the beginning part of this year, we still see continued higher than typical revenues.I'd say kind of difficult to sort of call the exact transition, because obviously that depends on really external factors of which we don't have complete visibility. I think the takeaway is that we build into the fact that we see where we don't have solid persistence that we do expect some of that to roll off, and so it's kind of built into how we think about things. And again, you'll hear more details about FY '20 at Analyst and Investor Day. But it is not unsubstantial however, again, just think about it that we build that into our plans. Okay, so it's not like where we expect to have longer persistence than what would be prudent.And our next question is from line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. -- Hi, thank you very much. I had a question on gross margin. I'm going back to the last peak in wireless and around that time. Company gross margin was between 68% and 69.5%, if my historical numbers are right. So the question is, is there something specific to 5G that is more detrimental, and I know your revenues are higher in wireless versus what they were before? And then my quick follow-up, it's a more blocking and tackling, Lorenzo, when you said second half gross margin comes back to a more normal level, or how do you define normal, and does that imply then wireless slows down considerably? Thank you. -- So, let me take the first question. So, look first of all, as you said, it's really a very different place in terms of the magnitude and size. And by the way, I want to also clarify, we're far from peaking, right, because this is just a very early stage of 5G. 5G is going to continue on for quite some time, because 5G is very ambitious. I mean, we see 5G being factors larger than 4G over its entirety. And the other thing is that we're talking about very advanced technologies, right, I mean the kinds of expense for developing silicon back in the initial deployment of 4G is significantly by many factors different, right, so I think you need to think about it that way as well.And then, I'll be given the part -- the starting part about the margins outlet Lorenzo pickup from there. I don't think the way your think about it is also comes back there for while, it's goes down substantially. I think we are seeing a much heavier mix, and I think what we're trying to get across here is that other markets strengthened, we get a little bit broader strengthened. And so that's the way should look at it as opposed to this big drop off in wireless. -- Right. So, I think at this point Ambrish, before Analyst Day, I want to stay in a relatively qualitative space in terms of providing guidance or shaping the year in terms of gross margin. What we're trying to communicate and just really to elaborate a little bit on what Victor laid out is, we are at this point in the gear seeing a very heavy concentration on wireless. It is significantly bigger than we have seen in the past, and that is as everybody follows the company knows puts pressure on our gross margins. So we see in the second half as I tried to lay out in my comments that other elements of the business, including ones that are traditionally stronger gross margin will continue to grow and balance out our mix. And when I say more typical, I think I'm pointing to ranges we would have seen in the past. I'd like to leave it at that until we get the Analyst Day. That's OK.And our next question is from line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. -- Thanks for taking my question. Victor, one more on 5G. I'm curious what proportion of your communications sales would you attribute to 5G? And do you think the market when you look at both 4G and 5G is big enough and growing fast enough that even if you get some displacement on the baseband side that you can still you're looking at still a good decent growth year for your communications segment overall? -- Well, again, I think we're in very early stages of the 5G deployment. We do have very good confidence that over the whole run of this cycle that this will be again factors larger even with some displacement of baseband as we said. There will be some degree of (inaudible) I think that overall the trend will be more growth. Again, we're not giving full year guidance here, we're giving sort of the qualitative guidance now. And we want to tell that with the fullness of the whole story at the Investor Day. But overall, I would say, yes, we think that 5G is definitely a growth driver. I want to say that we're still in the very early innings of that, but there will be still some pursiness depending upon the deployments as everyone knows, right. So Korea led the way initially, now they're gearing up for China. That's going to happen this year. Some of the geographies will come along and this is just the beginning.And our next question is from line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. -- Great, thanks for taking the question. Victor, can you give context around the data center D cell? In the March quarter you guys also talked about a potential rebound into June. So what drove the D cell in March and what drives the reacceleration in June? And related to that, I know it's early with Versal, but where are you seeing the most traction with customers in terms of applications? Thank you. -- Okay. So first, with regards to the data center and D cell in the last quarter, I would bracket that as a couple of things. One is, as you know, data center revenue includes some of the traditional data center we've always had, right. So not acceleration, not some of the new emerging areas, but it does include some of the emerging areas. And then in the past, we've talked about how crypto was quite small, but we had mentioned that. I'll do with the last one first, it was pretty small, but essentially went to zero, so that attributed a little bit to it.In our traditional business it's kind of business that we've had all along. We had one customer that had just a pause, I would say, and we expect that to rebound. Now on the more interesting business, we had -- that is has to do with acceleration and where we see the biggest growth opportunity, also coming off of last quarter. One customer took a bit of a pause, but we expect that to sort of come back. I think the bigger picture here is for data center is that where -- it's an emerging area, we still -- as I said, we've been still building foundation and we don't have a huge breadth and depth with multiple customers. So we will be a little bit exposed in this early phases when there are some key customers have shift the pauses. But it's not a trend, I mean if we saw it went down and we trend down and we're seeing breadth in that. We will be projecting something different obviously, but because of that it's not something you should feel, as I said, it's trend right. We had a one quarter D cell, and we see that picking up again. -- On our rebound just to finish up a point Victor brought about the crypto, the rebound we see going into the June quarter is now crypto element to it whatsoever. -- Yes, yes. -- Okay. The interesting stuff is Victor... -- So now on to Versal. First, we take that as expected. We're actually only short weeks away from getting a silicon in-house. So we're really excited about that. We have multiple early customer engagements across multiple markets. That does include communications, includes automotive, for autonomous driving, and includes test, it's pretty broad. If anything I would say that the limitations on sort of lighthouse engagements is more on some of the -- us enabling to provide enough support when things are in fairly early stages, but obviously once we start sampling that's going to widen out, but we see that as very strong interest in reversal. So we're very excited about that.And our next question is from line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to revisit the margins, because you obviously have seen a mix to come in wireless for the last several quarters and then you see the big step down in March. So just trying to understand why March is the one quarter you're seeing that step down? -- Two phenomenon work against us. One is, maybe the bad news from good news, which is the wireless business for other reasons Victor as talked about was very strong. So that's good news, but it does put pressure on our margins. The second, in a couple of our other end markets, particularly in test measurement emulation, we were below our expectations for the quarter. So that put more downward pressure on our margins.And our next question is from line of CJ Muse from Evercore. -- Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, as you think about rising mix across data center and wireless where there's clearly a pretty high customer concentration, is there a story line here where despite lower gross margins that OpEx, particularly SG&A and working with those clients would offer incrementally higher operating leverage, such that you could in fact see all in op leverage in line, if not better over time with your -- some of your other businesses? -- Well, let me first talk a little bit, and then Lorenzo please add color. So one thing again, first on data center you put those together with wireless. While data center is maybe not as in our margin strong a certain other things like aerospace and defense or TME, it's much closer to what our historical kinds of ranges have been at the corporate level. So I'm not sure I would group both of them together.I think, again, we have to keep perspective. I think there is a -- maybe there is a feeling as though everything rises and falls completely on wireless. And there's three elements to our strategy, right. So data center, growth and driving growth in all of our core markets, meaning that our broader markets, right, where we have very healthy margins we intend to continue to grow as we step for FY '19. We had double digit growth across all the market. So it's really not just about how we have ebb and inflow with wireless alone, it's also how we're doing in other core markets. And you heard Lorenzo just mentioned, part of the reason why despite that we had strength in wireless for few quarters, was it more accentuated and the gross margin drop, it has much to do with drops in other segments that are very strong and profitability versus simply wireless.So, and then in terms of what we're doing on OpEx, I think we will always try and manage our expenses very carefully. But I think I've also said in the past that we are going to lean into growth. We are investing for long-term growth. We're not going to do anything that isn't going to pay a significant return in the future, but you might see some ebbing and flowing of leverage in the near-term, but we are confident that of course we keep this growth. You will see leverage. But in any given quarter, we may be more of an investment mode. I already said in my opening comments that the coming fiscal year, which you will hear more details about at the Investor Conference that once we get Versal, we'll be doing some more 7-nanometer tape outs. We have to keep building our ecosystem. There are things that we have to invest now to keep these double digit kind of growth rates, and that's sort of what our position is. So... -- Yes, I actually don't have much to add to what Victor said, it's just that despite our lot of discussion right now on wireless, we do extract a great deal of horizontal leverage out of our investments, both in R&D and SG&A, and we extract those over time in a lot of ways. So I think the breadth of our end markets as Victor pointed out will provide us substantial profitability expansion in the long run.And our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. -- Hi guys, just wanted to ask a question and probably butcher the new names of the segments, but I'll just start with the TME side. Any color why that was weaker than you guys had expected in the March quarter? What's going on with I can't remember if you called AIT or IAT in the second quarter, where you said it was down? And then if we think in the second half, it seems like that bucket is the part that needs to get better to help your mix and improve the gross margin back to your average levels. Is that improvement, because it's something that's company specific, or are you making more of a cyclical assumption? -- Okay. So first, let me explain the TME, I'm glad you asked that. So recall the TME actually has got a bunch of sub-segments within that. One of them includes semiconductor test. For a while, semiconductor test was in very strong position. But as we all know, particularly in the memory side, things dramatically weakened. So we did see general semiconductor test weakened for us. Another sub segment is emulation prototyping. And I think Lorenzo maybe bleakly alluded to that, but I will say that we did have one significant customer that, you can kind of say that sort of in a bit of a transition situation. So there was a pause there and that wasn't exactly expected. Having said that, we also saw some strength, but it wasn't enough to overcome those headwinds and the strength was in some advanced testers, because of 5G being deployed, right. So even when that TME, we have some diversity, it just happened to fairly big elements at this point weakened, but again, we do see in the second half of FY '20 that strengthened again. And yes, sorry about all the acronyms, I'm sure once to get used to the PLAs, actually be better clarity, because we are separating things out more giving you a more granularity. But I think your general proposition that, yes, kind of like the gross -- the enterprise level gross margin will rebalance as much, because other things are coming into play. And again, of course, wireless is still matter, but it's not solely moving just on wireless. So Lorenzo, you want to... -- Yes, the -- you actually did a pretty good job, Ross, on the nomenclature. AIT include some relatively large revenue segment. And the first half, two of them will be relatively low, but we look to them and we have some visibility into what's driving the strength in the second half of the year. Those coming back heavier into our overall mix and the continued growth of other elements of our business that are closer to our corporate average gross margin, those will push the gross margin back up, as I described earlier.And our next question is from line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. -- Great, thank you. Seemed like there were some tightness in the quarter on substrates and things like that. Did that have any effect on your business and just any comment that you gave us on lead times or customer inventories would be helpful? -- Yes, I mean, there were few things that made delivery something that we have to work very diligently with, I would say that we manage through some of those challenges, you mentioned one, there were other things. I think everybody knows the TSMC's issue around their photoresist. And we managed through that, it was a big effort, but we did manage through that. So you shouldn't take away that we had any impact due to that, but I would say that we had to execute very, very heavily. And it did sort of, I guess, what I'd say is that caused a lot of navigation and what we had to deliver like for instance wireless like that. That is something that all our key customers were hitting -- shooting for some deployment date, so that absolutely had to get shifted at some level. But I think overall, our operations team did really well working with our supply chain to not have anything material happened with regard to that. So -- but good point there were some challenges.And our next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. -- Hi, good afternoon. Given the momentum you now have in 5G base station, could you give us a sense of the content in 5G versus 4G or anyway we could quantify how much you want unit-wise to-date? -- Yes, again, I'll go back and say, we'll talk about this more on Analyst day, but just to reiterate some of the things you said. I mean our content will be higher, particularly in radio, and there will be both, because we're adding a lot more value, we're not just doing the same types of products we've done in the past. And also because of the shift in the more radio units shipped in the 5G and 5G will just deploy more, there are many different form factors, not just about traditional macro base stations, right, there is small cells (inaudible) all kinds of different deployments. And then we've talked several times now base station. So generally, I would say, qualitatively, yes, we expect to have both more content, particularly in the radio, and then there's going to be more of them. So -- but please stay tuned for the Analyst Day.And our next question is from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. -- Great, thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you can help us better understand the strategy around the portfolio as it relates to M&A and venture investments, there's been some pretty heavy speculation that you were looking at a large public company that someone else acquired, but here you're announcing a smaller acquisition today, and I think you said 20 investments in the venture fund. Can you help sort of tie all these things together, so we understand this from some may be a top level perspective? How important is M&A and these investments of what's the strategy around it? Thank you. -- Yes, good question. Let me give you some high level and I'll have Matt, who runs our, Corp. Dev. maybe add some color. So it's just at the highest level, I think the kind of thing you should look at, I think we've been consistent in both what we said and more importantly our actions, is that whenever you do M&A, it will be very strongly aligned with our strategy, right. Either fortifying that strategy position, and of course in the long run may be increasing the opportunity. If it's a bigger business, obviously, there should be acceleration in the more tangible and full near-term kind of range.I wouldn't say, we've already -- we've ever said, hey, we're only looking at ""tuck-ins"", or like, hey, we're only guiding for public-to-public and stuff like that. I would say that we look at every opportunity, we look at what we feel is makes the most sense for us, but again the common theme will be strongly aligned to our strategy, which has three different elements to it.Matt, you want to add anything more to that? -- Yes. And look from our perspective, anything we can do that aligns with the strategy that ultimately balances the time to achieve the returns that we're guiding to against the value that we're providing through an investment or through an acquisition. We're certainly very focused on balancing that. Appropriately from a VC perspective, we do have a venture activity that has been more active for the last two fiscal years. We'll talk more about that in the Analyst Day. But from an increase in the ecosystem engagement with data center partners, applications providers, I'm helping to build our Alveo ecosystem, increasing engagement with Xilinx's platform, that's all part of the focus. And then to Victor's point, whether that's a tuck-in acquisition, that's more technology and team focused versus a larger business acquisition. Those will absolutely be down along with the strategy of the company across our elements we've provided more context on. -- One thing maybe I'd like to point out is like, the DeePhi of course, that was a team that has deep expertise and innovative IP and machine learning, which is actually quite broad, right. It's just not data center, it's actually quite broad. The announcement of our intention to try and acquire Solarflare that's more related to specifically the networking opportunity that we've talked about in data center. But, also within that, they have -- as far as R&D goes, it's predominantly software and systems kind of expertise. I think that strongly in my opening remarks that we are also looking to see how we complement our expertise. I think we're well known being really leaders and doing very advanced silicon and a lot of software close to the metal so to speak. So I think the other trend you can kind of see is us going out and getting talent in IP that complements and brings us higher up the solution stack, if you will.And our next question is from the line of Chris Danely from Citi. -- Hey, thanks guys. Just a longer-term question on gross margin. So Vic, I think you said that 5G is going to be many times bigger than 4G and you guys are talking about the margins on wireless being below the corporate average. So how do we get margins back to that or TME gross margins back to that 70% level, or should we think of gross margins kind of hanging out in the upper 60's range for a few years? -- I mean, let me again answer that qualitatively. The other thing that we haven't yet said just to sort of bring your attention to is that, people that are shipping now on volume for this early phase of 5G, they're using very advanced technologies, right. This is our 16-nanometer very leading-edge technologies, certainly there many communications people that are looking at Versal already, even before silicon arrives. In the early part of when we have new products, right, if they're -- they still have room in terms of cost reduction, in terms of yields and other things we do to optimize and reduce our cost to some extent the other fact about this being deployed sooner than we expected is, it's happening at a point in our kind of our cost road maps that are reasonable, but it has certainly has room for improvement. And so we're working very aggressively toward that, right. So that's one point, right.I think the other thing is, in general, we're trying to and we are adding more value by doing things like integrating high-performance analog technology monolithically. And we're doing other things to create value and therefore support higher margins through that perspective. And we talked about the mix enough, but what I would say is there's no one silver bullet, right. It's just basically working hard at a bunch of things, both on the cost side, on the value side, on just how we go to market and things like that. So that's what we're doing.And our next question is from line of Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie. -- Thank you. Victor, on 5G, I think you mentioned you're adding more value clearly and that's driving some of the growth. I'm just curious, I believe at least from what I can see you also picked up some share versus 4G. I'm wondering if you could put some numbers around what your market share was versus your primary competitor in 4G versus 5G? And then how sustainable do you think that is? And then for loans just a clarification, did you have any 10% customer in the May quarter, I'm sorry, March quarter? Thank you. -- So let me first talk to the first part. In general, I'd say, yes, absolutely. We think we have higher market share now. We think that's actually going to expand. It's still early days in 5G, but I think based on a number of factors. One is, the RFSoC which we just expanded that offering there is still no competitor that had that kind of a device. Yes, people are talking about when they might have integrated in a package advanced analog or when they might tape out in the monolithic high performers logic together with ADCs and DACs. We've done it. We've been in the market for some time now. We've already announced our follow-on products, so that's just one example. Why we think that we will, -- we are adding more value. Therefore, we're going to get more content in share.The other thing I would point out compared to all the generations, all the generations what's being used is a pure FPGA. RFSoC has a fully integrated multi-core SoC, so there is a software element. So there is more stickiness to it. People are also rearchitecting the entire radio architecture where people are looking at having machine learning and other things to sort of have adaptive being forming all kinds of other technologies, which nobody was thinking about the 4G generation, right. So the problem in 5G is much more challenging, and we are delivering to our customers more value to help them meet those challenges and we've got out to market sooner. So a lot of leadership on multiple dimensions. -- Yes. And so with respect to the customer concentration question, our disclosure requirements at this time of the year are for 10% customer -- greater than 10% customers for the year, and we didn't have any customers close to that. So we are -- we do have, I guess, the top of the table, if you will, with several significant customers that it can ebb and flow in terms of who's specifically at the top of the table. But for our disclosure requirements for the year, we didn't have any 10% customers.And our next question is from line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. -- Yes, hi guys. Victor, just a question on the radio side, I guess, when you go to 5G, there are multiple radios, do you see any change in the competitive landscape in terms of -- do you see that getting replaced by ACICs, or you see that still being FPGAs for some time? And also on the gross margin side, as you guys go down to Gen 2, Gen 3 with millimeter wave capabilities and 7-nanometer, how do you think the gross margins trend on the radio is going forward? Thanks. -- Okay. Yes, So for the first part, I don't -- again, I think our position on radio is strong and actually getting stronger. I don't really see the ASIC replacement. Again, there is no one even the big players from either the analog side or digital side that has integrated such high performance capability in that. And again, we have other aspects of the IP, not just ADCs and DACs, but some of things we do with the SoC as well as the fabric itself, and other areas we're adding value to the overall platform, if you will. So I don't think we have much risk there. We've been very open about the baseband side, and that's probably our greatest risk in terms of ASIC displacement.In terms of future generations, I think we are talking about this process node. We absolutely will support in the 7-nanometer generation. Versal is the name of a product family. We have six sub families that we refer to a series. So there is an RF Series with Versal 7-nanometer, but that's a ways out. And we will be supplying, delivering and driving revenue for a number of years for the 16-nanometer generation. When we are out there with the 7 nanometer since we do investment in that entire portfolio, we still get a good return. Again against the fact that our architectures are scalable and also modular. And I said multiple times Versal is going to hit essentially over time every end market that we have. So it's a very -- it's still a very leveraged investment, a very big investment, getting bigger with each advanced node. But it will be -- it will provide a very good return.And our next question is from the line of David Wong from Nomura. -- Thank you very much. Within Communications, can you give us some feel for what proportion of your revenues radio versus baseband? -- We don't usually give that, and quite frankly, I don't know the exact number. We have substantial revenue in both at the moment. Again, please attend the Analyst Day and we'll give you more color. But let's just say, it's -- we have strengthened both right now. And again, I think over time, of course, probably radio will still be a larger proportion, but please you can repeat that question at our Investor Day.And our next question is from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. -- And just maybe following up on the last one, just as a recollection from the 4G ramp, you guys were traditionally more heavier or strong in radios and less in the BTS. But it seems like you guys are doing a lot better in baseband this time around. And just wondering why, what is it that you guys were doing this time around that's allowing you to take more share in that part of the base station? Thanks. -- Yes, so first of all, I want to reaffirm what you said that, yes, we traditionally have been stronger in radio than baseband. And if anything, we will be even stronger in the radio, and there are more radios. Now you're also right that we have greater strength right now in this early phase on the baseband and why is that. That's kind of interesting, right. There's a few things. One is that we're not just the same old FPGA, technology and what we've implemented in UltraScale+ is really advanced, right. And there is very few people still that have the breadth and the scale of products. Our products are very flexible. Therefore, when standards are only frozen pretty soon and then people want to deploy, the carriers want to deploy, we can get you there, right.Our adaptability and flexibility enables you to go to market very rapidly even in a very changing dynamic market. So I think that highlights one of our key value propositions, which now with our capability being significantly more than in the 4G generation is coming to the floor. I'd say, the counter side to it, these ASICs are really hard. There are fewer companies that have either the financial justification for the assets (ph) required or even the technical capabilities to execute that well, particularly in a changing market.So ASICs need some degree of stability and spaces in order to get taped out, and the things are always changing, you just can't do it. That you have to sort of do with the super set of everything which kind of defeats the whole purpose of doing an ASIC. So I think there's kind of a relative thing going on here. That all said, again, we've just been very candid that we don't see that the strength that we have in the near-term that necessarily going to completely persist. We will always maintain some position. But then 7-nanometer comes, because we've taken it up several levels in the architectural innovation and 7-nanometers, we hope to be able to capture more than the historical norm.(Operator Instructions) And at this time, I'm showing that we have no further questions over the phone lines. Presenters, I turn the call back to you. -- Well, thanks for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific, 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our Investor Relations website. Our next earnings release dated for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 will be Wednesday, July 24th after the market close.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

emiconductor stocks had a hard time toward the end of 2018, but they have gotten off to a flying start this year. This is clearly evident from the impressive gains clocked by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index so far in 2019.NVIDIA and Xilinx Year-to-Date Stock Performance vs. PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, data by .The positive sentiment has rubbed off nicely on the likes of   and  : two chipmakers that have been in the news in recent months for reasons both good and bad. Though NVIDIA has  in the aftermath of the cryptocurrency bust -- and the company has warned that it is in for a difficult year -- shareholders seem upbeat.Xilinx, meanwhile, has taken off, thanks to a diverse set of catalysts that have positively impacted its . Its programmable chips are in great demand on the back of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled data centers. So, Xilinx's rally seems justified when compared with NVIDIA's.But is that enough to make Xilinx a better bet than NVIDIA? Let's find out.Image Source: Getty ImagesNVIDIA is having a terrible time right now because its gaming hardware business has taken a big hit due to an oversupply of graphics cards. The gaming segment's revenue crashed 45% year over year during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, dealing a body blow to NVIDIA's top and bottom lines, as it accounts for nearly half of the company's sales.Also, sales in NVIDIA's OEM and intellectual property segment, which includes sales of graphics cards for cryptocurrency mining purposes, fell 36% year over year. NVIDIA doesn't have a way of identifying if the graphics cards it sells are used for gaming or mining by the end user. So, there's a possibility that some of the graphics card sales included in the gaming segment actually went to cryptocurrency miners.Once the cryptocurrency mining wave died, graphics card prices crashed as demand fizzled out. Retailers were left with excess graphics card supply, and they are busy working through that glut. As a result, graphics card demand is weak.NVIDIA is witnessing weaker-than-anticipated sales of its latest-generation graphics cards, although it believes that the market will hit bottom in the current quarter. But even if that happens, NVIDIA's outlook for the year indicates that it will struggle to attain the kind of rapid growth that investors grew used to in recent years.The company expects full-year revenue to be flat in fiscal 2020, though investors can take heart that it anticipates a major comeback after a projected 31% year-over-year sales decline in the current quarter. However, NVIDIA may find it difficult to walk the talk, since rival ' product development moves could help the latter  in the gaming and data center markets.In my opinion, investors should wait for concrete signs of a turnaround at NVIDIA before buying into the stock. The market isn't likely to take a lenient view the next time its results and guidance fall below expectations, so it's better to be safe than sorry.Xilinx has stepped into the limelight big-time in recent quarters because of the utility of its programmable chips. The company's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are  by the likes of  and  to power their AI-enabled cloud computing applications. Also, Xilinx's chips are being used in smart memory drives meant to enhance computing speeds in data centers.But the hottest catalyst for Xilinx right now is 5G wireless connectivity. The company's communications revenue shot up 41% year over year last quarter, thanks to its early 5G deployments. Telecom customers  to buy Xilinx's FPGAs because they can be configured after being purchased, allowing network operators to make any tweaks or updates easily during the initial rollout phase.This creates a massive opportunity for Xilinx, since more telecom operators can be expected to opt for its programmable chips once 5G network deployments gather steam globally. IDC estimates that 5G infrastructure investments will jump from $528 million last year to $26 billion in 2022, indicating healthy demand for Xilinx's programmable chips.More importantly, Xilinx is future-proofing its 5G opportunity by integrating additional features into its 5G chip platform. The company is trying to ensure that its offerings remain relevant even when application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) meant specifically for 5G infrastructure hit the market.The chipmaker says that its 5G chip platform can reduce the power consumption and size of the system by 50% to 75%, thanks to the integration of digital, analog, and embedded software into a single design.Meanwhile, FPGA demand in data centers is expected to increase at a rapid pace. According to Research and Markets, demand for data center accelerator chips, such as central processing units, graphics cards, FPGAs, and ASICs, is expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 50% through 2023, when the market will be worth $21 billion.Of these types of chips, demand for FPGAs is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period because they are expected to play an important role in accelerating enterprise workloads. Xilinx is in the pole position to take advantage of this opportunity because it .Xilinx's business is on the rise while NVIDIA's is waning.NVIDIA vs. Xilinx Revenue and Net Income (Quarterly), data by .However, investors looking to take advantage of Xilinx's growth will have to pay a premium, as the stock trades at almost 40 times the company's current-year earnings. NVIDIA is cheaper, with a trailing  (P/E) ratio of less than 29. But Xilinx's premium seems justified because of its superior growth rate. Also, the company enjoys a clear path to success, as it leads the fast-growing FPGA market, while NVIDIA is trying to overcome its recent slump in the face of tough competition from AMD.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock market had a really good start to 2019. To kick things off, the  rose nearly 8% in January, its best January performance since 1987. Things didn't slow much thereafter. The S&P 500 rose 3% in February (tenth February best since 1987), and 2% in March (fifteenth best March since 1987). All in all, the S&P 500 finished the first quarter of 2019 up more than 13%. That's good enough to be the stock market's best Q1 performance in over twenty years.It goes without saying that the market's best first-quarter performance in more than two decades was accompanied by a handful of S&P 500 stocks that have staged huge year-to-date rallies. Indeed, as  , 2019 has had more breakout stocks than we've seen in years prior. That's mostly a function of two things:1) Stocks are on fire.2) Growth is back.By that reasoning, growth stocks are doubly on fire! Indeed, to make the cut as one of the six best-performing S&P 500 stocks in Q1, a stock had to gain more than 50% in the quarter. No easy feat. That means through the first three months of 2019, there were  S&P 500 stocks that gained more than 50%.Which stocks belong in that group? Why did they stage such monster rallies? Will they keep rallying?Let's answer those questions by taking a closer look at the six best-performing S&P 500 stocks in a record first quarter for the S&P 500. 72% Global beauty giant  (NYSE:  ) was the beneficiary of two big catalysts in the first quarter of 2019. First, the company reported a robust double-beat earnings report in early February that caused shares to rally in a big way. Second, just a few days thereafter, German conglomerate  offered to purchases 150 million shares of Coty at a purchase price of $11.65. At the time, COTY stock was changing hands below $10. Consequently, COTY stock has since rallied closer to the proposed $11.65 purchase price. COTY stock has more room to run higher in 2019. The stock has fallen flat over the past two months because Coty management has been reviewing the JAB tender offer. But, considering JAB is already a 40% holder of Coty stock, this offer will likely go through. Once it does, COTY stock will move higher for three reasons:1) The stock is still below the $11.65 tender offer price.2) New money brings in new confidence.3) The stock is still pretty cheap at just 17-forward earnings. 67% The big 2019 rally in document management systems company  (NYSE:  ) can be attributed to three things. First, there was a big selloff leading into 2019, wherein XRX stock dropped 30% in less than a month.Second, the company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings in late January 2019, which largely underscored that the 30% selloff in late 2018 was unwarranted. Third, buyout talk has kept shares on a solid uptrend ever since the strong Q4 report. After the near 70% year-to-date rally, XRX stock is now trading at levels that are historically normal. The stock is back at a low $30s price tag, which has roughly served as a ceiling for the stock over the past five years.Meanwhile, the valuation is at 9x forward earnings, which is essentially the norm for where this stock has traded over the past several years. As such, further upside isn't compelling. It seems XRX stock used all its firepower to get back to normal, and that there isn't much left in the tank to power further gains in 2019. 64% The long overdue turnaround in fast-casual Mexican eatery  (NYSE:  ) is finally here. New management came in around a year ago, and they have since flawlessly executed on some very important growth initiatives, including expanding the digital business, revamping the menu and rolling out a nationwide advertising campaign.All of these initiatives have worked. Comparable sales growth and traffic trends have improved meaningfully, and those improvements have allowed for concurrent margin improvements, too. CMG stock has consequently soared over the past year, and the rally hasn't slowed in 2019. At this point in time, CMG stock is the most expensive restaurant stock I have ever seen, and on that basis alone, further gains in the stock seem unlikely in the near future. To be sure, the long-term fundamentals here are healthy. But, this is a very competitive space, and no company in the fast-casual business flawlessly executes for that long. Chipotle has been flawlessly executing for a year. They are due for a hiccup. When that hiccup happens, the stock will drop in a big way. 52% All semiconductor stocks have been in rally mode in 2019, amid broad improvements across the global semiconductor industry (demand has firmed up thanks to global economic stabilization, supply is dropping due to aggressive Q1 clearing, and trade and FX headwinds have become less severe).Among the biggest gainers in that group in 2019 has been  (NASDAQ:  ), mostly due to the company's robust double-beat-and-raise third-quarter earnings report at the end of January, which confirmed the aforementioned semiconductor market improvements. It seems like all the good news is already priced into XLNX stock. To be sure, there's a lot of good news right now for semis, but at such a rich valuation (33x forward earnings), it's tough to see the stock heading meaningfully higher in the foreseeable future.Instead, while earnings may grow over the next several quarters, today's stretched multiple will likely fall back, and that combo will lead to decent but not substantial gains in the stock. 52% Cloud networking giant  (NYSE:  ) has been on fire in 2019 ever since the company reported a beat-and-raise Q4 earnings report in mid-February.Broadly speaking, that report largely confirmed that cloud spending trends remain favorable even in a slowing global economy. The implication? The late 2018 selloff in ANET stock was way overdone. Analysts upgraded the stock. Investors bought the stock. ANET soared. Arista is a long term winner powered by secular growth trends in cloud service adoption and spend, currently growing revenues at a 30%-plus rate, with gross margins that are healthily north of 60%. Right now, investors get all of that for just 34x forward earnings, which isn't a bad multiple for a 30%-revenue grower with broad exposure to the cloud. As such, this rally doesn't seem like it's over just yet. The multiple is stable here, and earnings will keep growing at a robust rate, so further gains in the stock seem likely through the balance of 2019. 52% The big 2019 rally in waste removal giant  (NASDAQ:  ) can be chalked up to one thing: the stock simply got way too cheap in late 2018. Amid slowing economic growth concerns and a financial market meltdown, SRCL stock tumbled from $75 early in 2018, to $34 by late 2018, bringing the forward earnings multiple on the stock to 7.5 (versus a five-year average forward multiple of 19). Strong quarterly numbers in early 2019 confirmed that these late 2018 fears were overblown. The valuation has since normalized, and the stock has soared. It looks like SRCL stock can head higher from here. This is a stable business with a large moat that is providing solutions of enduring and sustainable value. Growth going forward won't be big, but it will be stable, much like it has been for the past several years.During that stretch, SRCL stock traded at 19x forward earnings. Today, the forward multiple is around 15. Consequently, there's reason to believe the stock isn't done rallying just yet.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Should You Buy Q1’s 6 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks?@2019-04-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-q1s-6-best-performing-sp-500-stocks-2019-04-02-0

The multiple is stable here, and earnings will keep growing at a robust rate, so further gains in the stock seem likely through the balance of 2019.Source: 
	52%The big 2019 rally in waste removal giant  (NASDAQ:) can be chalked up to one thing: the stock simply got way too cheap in late 2018. Amid slowing economic growth concerns and a financial market meltdown, SRCL stock tumbled from $75 early in 2018, to $34 by late 2018, bringing the forward earnings multiple on the stock to 7.5 (versus a five-year average forward multiple of 19). Strong quarterly numbers in early 2019 confirmed that these late 2018 fears were overblown. The valuation has since normalized, and the stock has soared.It looks like SRCL stock can head higher from here. This is a stable business with a large moat that is providing solutions of enduring and sustainable value. Growth going forward won’t be big, but it will be stable, much like it has been for the past several years.During that stretch, SRCL stock traded at 19x forward earnings. Today, the forward multiple is around 15. Consequently, there’s reason to believe the stock isn’t done rallying just yet.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Should You Buy Q1’s 6 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks?@2019-04-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-q1s-6-best-performing-sp-500-stocks-2019-04-02

"ggressive growth stocks can produce market-beating returns by disrupting industries and taking advantage of big, new trends, but there are risks. High-growth companies often spend more money than they make to stay ahead of competitors, and that means there's little money left over to reward investors with earnings, share repurchases, or dividends. That situation can lead to stomach churning volatility, so picking the right growth stocks to buy is important. To help you find the best growth stocks, we asked three Motley Fool investors for their top picks. They recommended , , and  . Are these stocks right for your growth portfolio?Semiconductor outfit Xilinx invented the field programmable chip back in the 1980s, but recently the technology has really started to take off. That's due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in data centers and resulting cloud computing services. The ability to customize and reprogram these chips is winning lots of new customers, a trend that could continue to pick up steam as AI-powered computing increases in importance. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Xilinx is winning in other areas, too, partnering with  to bring new  technology to market. The automotive and consumer industries are also growing rapidly. Over the next three years, Xilinx expects its addressable market to grow 13% a year, from about $14 billion right now to $23 billion in 2022. That has already led to massive growth in the past year. Through Xilinx's the , the company's sales and earnings per share have soared 22% and 106%, respectively. As a result, the stock is up 76% over the last trailing 12-month stretch as of this writing. Despite the big return, though, there could be plenty left in the tank. Wall Street seems to agree, and Xilinx shares thus trade at a premium of 33.7 times free cash flow (money left over after basic operating expenses and capital expenses are paid for). A fair amount of future growth is therefore already priced in at this point. However, demand for field programmable chips is expected to keep rising in the coming years, and Xilinx is handily in the lead in this space. Shares could continue to soar if the company can keep demonstrating its capabilities in AI and cloud computing.  Since its peak in late summer of 2018, shares of infrastructure engineering company NV5 Global have fallen more than 30%. Or to be more accurate, they fell by 30%, gained 45%, and then fell sharply a second time: data by Of course, the first drop was part of the bigger stock market correction that saw the lose 20% of its value from early October to late December of last year. But that second drop was completely the market's reaction to  in early March. Or to be more accurate, it was the market's reaction to management's guidance for 2019 sales, as well as some concern over the company's mention of a ""material weakness"" it had uncovered in its financial controls. Either way you slice it, the giant sell-off  of this high-growth company at an attractive price. The company is calling for sales to grow 15% to 24% and for adjusted earnings to grow 8% to 21% in 2019, which isn't something to sneeze at. Based on the current share price, you can buy NV5 for between 21 and 24 times guidance for 2019 GAAP earnings per share, expected to be between $2.44 and $2.85 per share. Since going public just over five years ago, NV5 has already delivered massive gains for investors:  data by But the global infrastructure business is multiple trillions of dollars per year in size, and the company just reached $400 million in sales last year. Despite the big returns so far, there's a lot of growth still ahead. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.: It's not every day that investors can invest early on in a multibillion-dollar market that already exists. But that's what's happening with marijuana, a market opportunity worth $150 billion worldwide that's only now emerging from the shadows.In the past, marijuana prohibition meant investors couldn't profit from pot, but legalization is gaining steam following the opening of Canada's recreational market last fall, making publicly traded cannabis companies attractive. One of the most intriguing of these companies is Aurora Cannabis, the second largest Canadian cannabis company by sales. Aurora Cannabis' quarter-over-quarter  to $54 million Canadian from CA$35 million in the fourth quarter, and that's probably only scratching the surface, given that Canadians spend over CA$5 billion illegally on marijuana every year. The company's marijuana production was 7,822 kilos last quarter, but its annualized production reached 120,000 kilos in February, and its peak funded-marijuana production because of expansion plans exceeds 570,000 kilos annually.It's not just Canada that makes Aurora Cannabis intriguing, either. To make sure it doesn't miss out on the global marijuana opportunity, it's expanding into Europe and South America. It also hired billionaire consumer-goods investor  recently to help it lock up deals that conceivably could tap the massive $50 billion U.S. marijuana market someday.Admittedly, Aurora Cannabis has issued a lot of shares to acquire competitors in the past, diluting investors along the way, and its losses are likely to continue because of its expansion plans. However, it's in the early innings for legal marijuana companies, and given that billions of dollars are up for grabs, I think Aurora Cannabis is a top stock worth owning in risk-tolerant growth portfolios. When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" wireless technology is almost upon us, as 2019 is expected to be the first year when we'll witness meaningful deployment of this standard. Some of the major telecom carriers are set to launch commercial 5G wireless networks in the U.S., as well as in other regions around the globe, this year. Several smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are also prepping to launch their first 5G devices to take advantage of the new wireless standard.The rollout of 5G infrastructure across the globe is estimated to boost spending on networks and networking infrastructure from $528 million in 2018 to $26 billion in 2022, according to IDC, which it says is a compound annual growth rate of 118%.So now is a good time for investors to take a closer look at   and   as these chipmakers could win big from this hot new trend.Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx has been a surprise package of late thanks to tremendous 5G-driven growth. The chipmaker is best known for supplying programmable chips -- known as FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) -- that can be bought off the shelf and programmed to perform specific tasks. Just a few quarters ago, artificial intelligence (AI) in the cloud was looking like , and the company was busy shoring up its product development to keep archrival  at bay.However, thanks to the programmable nature of its FPGAs, Xilinx became  for telecom carriers deploying 5G networks in China and South Korea. When 5G networks start up, carriers might need to make tweaks to their infrastructure to iron out flaws, and FPGAs are well-suited to this purpose because they can be programmed and reprogrammed as required.As a result, Xilinx saw a massive spike in its communications business last quarter. It was the company's fastest-growing segment, with annual revenue growth of 41%. More importantly, it accounted for 35% of Xilinx's total business.Xilinx should witness higher FPGA demand in the quarters ahead as the 5G rollout gathers pace. Since its communications revenue was driven by what it called ""very early production 5G and pre-5G deployments,"" there's reason to believe that the anticipated sharp spike in infrastructure investments would be a tailwind for Xilinx.Moreover, the chipmaker is looking to future-proof its 5G business before the arrival of specialized chips: It's developing  that should allow it to take advantage of this opportunity for a long time to come.Qorvo has managed to come out of 's shadow this year despite relying on the iPhone maker for a large chunk (around a third) of its revenue. The stock has ticked upward even with weak iPhone demand, and some of the credit for this resilience should go to the uptick it's been witnessing in its 5G business.Qorvo's infrastructure and defense products (IDP) revenue has now recorded double-digit growth for 11 quarters in a row. Revenue from this segment was up 14% in the latest quarter, as an increase in investments by telecom carriers boosted demand for the company's infrastructure products.More specifically, Qorvo ""enjoyed significant demand for our massive MIMO solutions from multiple OEMs,"" management said in the conference call with analysts. Massive MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) technology is critical to the deployment of 5G technology as it allows the network to send and receive multiple signals over a single radio channel.According to Qorvo, a massive MIMO deployment ideally contains eight to 12 times the radio content present in a typical base station. In fact, the company specifies that each base station with massive MIMO capability contains $1,200 worth of radio frequency content. This means that Qorvo's end market will increase as more 5G base stations are deployed.What's more, 5G opens up the possibility for Qorvo to turn its mobile business around. It's currently working on designs with several smartphone OEMs, some of which could eventually choose its 5G radios for use in their devices. So 5G has the potential to lift Qorvo's business to another level as it will impact not just its infrastructure business, but mobile as well.This may be as good a time as any for investors to start scouring for 5G stocks as deployments have begun, and infrastructure investments should increase rapidly as more telecom carriers decide to take the plunge. Xilinx and Qorvo are already benefiting from this trend, and that makes them a great place to start.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them!

"Chicago, IL - March 25, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation  , Xilinx, Inc.  , Lattice Semiconductor Corp.  and KLA-Tencor Corporation  .After a torrid 2018, chipmakers bounced back this year. Chip stocks collectively notched their best start to a year, boosting investors' sentiment amid lingering global growth concerns. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor, a fund that mostly tracks semiconductor stocks, has soared more than 20% since the beginning of this year, the best first-quarter performance since the fund's inception in 2000. The fund easily outperformed the broader S&P 500'S 12% rally so far this year. Chipmakers, in fact, have posted gains in 10 out of the last 12 weeks.Trade dispute between United States and China along with worries about China's economic well-being affected a few of the semiconductor industry bigwigs. Weak iPhone sales along with deceleration in cryptocurrency mining ventures further raised questions about weakening demand for chips. But, investors saw promising trends in the semiconductor industry this year, which eventually helped chip stocks climb more than 30% since the recent low touched on Dec 26, 2018.The Fed's patient stance with interest rate hikes has bolstered high-flyers in the industry. After all, rising rates do affect these stocks as investors adjust to a new environment.By the way, chipmakers have become more realistic about growth trends. The industry has recognized a glut of chips in the market and it's time to curb production. And that's exactly what Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra acknowledged and pledged to cut 5% of chip production. This lifted Micron's shares 9.6% to $43.99 on Mar 21, after touching an intraday high of $44.21. Largely, the PHLX Semiconductor Index increased 3.5% and closed at 1,441.83, just short of its record of 1,445.90 set on Mar 12.To top it, NVIDIA Corporation's $6.8-billion bid to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox helped renew investors' faith on the beaten-down sector. If the deal is sealed, it would be Nvidia's biggest and will also strengthen its hold in the growing data center market.As a matter of fact, it's the data center market that first and foremost boosted chip stocks this year. Adding to the optimism is an array of new technological trends like 5G wireless, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and the Internet of Things.Some investors are seeing even more positives for these semiconductor stocks, citing consumer are on a solid footing, especially, in the United States. Consumer confidence bounced back in February on a healthy labor market and an end to the U.S. government's longest shutdown in history.

What a difference a quarter can make. At the end of last year, when the market was in bad shape, semiconductor stocks were some of the worst performing equities in the entire market. The  (NASDAQ:  ) plunged as a variety of economic issues took hold. But year-to-date is another story. The SOXX and chip stocks are on a roll.Why the sudden change?First off, the Federal Reserve has taken its foot off the brake and paused on raising interest rates. That's left the flow of easy money going. With that, investors have flooded growth stocks once again - with technology equities getting a huge piece of that pie. Semiconductor stocks couldn't help but rally.At the same time, the global economic backdrop has been better. With the predicted end of the U.S.-China trade war, demand for the chips is expected to skyrocket over the next few years as growth returns. With prices depressed at the end of last year, the semis were a huge value compared to many other sectors. Add in a ton of recent M&A deals and you have a recipe for success.The best part is that there is still time for the SOXX and semiconductor stocks to keep the mojo going.For investors, despite its recent hotness, the semiconductor stocks could be a great buy going forward. But which ones? Here are five of the best chip makers around. Source: ShutterstockI'll admit it,  (NASDAQ:  ) seems like the easy lay-up when it comes to the semiconductor stocks. But that's only because NVDA continues to find more ways to win. While graphics-processing units (GPUs) have long been the staple in video game and gaming PCs, the chip stock has been finding plenty of new ways to use its technology. That includes a hefty amount of self-driving automobiles, A.I. and even bitcoin mining.Even better is that GPUs are quickly becoming standard equipment in cloud computing and data center management. The reason is that GPUs benefit from so-called parallel computing in that they can perform multiple, complex mathematical calculations rather quickly. That makes them perfect for A.I. and other data center applications. And NVDA has benefited tremendously.Datacenter revenue jumped  from 2018 to the fiscal-year 2019 for NVIDIA. That's very strong growth and its only poised to continue rising as firm's take advantage of the chip makers lighting fast GPU processers. And its recent buyout of  (NASDAQ:  ) only adds to this. MLNX specializes in chips, networking gear, and interconnects that speed up the exchange of data. These are also all major components in cloud computing. Given their already standing partnership, the buyout now gives NVDA an all-in-one play on powering cloud computing.Meanwhile, the tech wreck of last year still has NVDA trading for a forward P/E of just 25. That's not super expensive, given its long-term runway for growth. Source: ShutterstockThere's a good chance you've never heard of  (NASDAQ  ). But the firm could overthrow NVDA as the king of the semiconductor stocks over the long haul. That's because of the type of chip it specializes in.XLNX makes something called a field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and various forms of the semiconductor. The beauty of FPGAs is that their logic programming can be changed continuously. This means that they can adapt to changing requirements and are perfect for machine learning/artificial intelligence. That's a huge advantage over GPUs.The firm has seen plenty of robust revenues - with sales growing by  in the last reported quarter - as more data center and device manufacturers look towards FPGAs. That in of itself is the reason to consider the semiconductor stock.The other is that, right now, XLNX is only one of two - the other is  (NASDAQ:  ) - producers of FPGA chipsets. For Xilinx, this is where it gets interesting. INTC had to buy its way into the market for these chips and spent a pretty penny to do so. As the only other player in the market - and a pure player at that - anyone else looking to do so, will have to snag XLNX. A couple more quarters of rising revenues and real buyout premium will exist. Source: ShutterstockThose chip stocks that have been able to make some big moves and tilt towards hot trends have been rewarded by investors. That includes  (NASDAQ:  ). Once the king of NAND Flash and other memory chips, CY has continued to pivot towards two very big trends. That would be the Internet of Things (IoT) and self-driving cars.For starters, CY has become an  with the firm's company's portfolio consisting of micro-controllers, semiconductors for wireless connectivity, USB-C chips and touchscreen controllers. However, the bell of the ball could be its specialized computer memory called NOR flash. According to Cypress, NOR Flash chips offer high performance and are fail-safe storage systems. That sort of need is critical when you have a computer making decisions such as driving a car for you. Already, about half of all automatic driving systems use NOR Flash to function. With driverless car demand/growth assured, CY should be able to profit from this trend. Already, it controls 68% of NOR Flash market.Secondly, Cypress is dominating IoT. The firm's programmable  chips offer advantages in power consumption, security and programmability over other rivals IoT offerings. Meanwhile, CY sells plenty of wireless/Bluetooth controllers needed to connect devices to the internet. As a result, the firm has seen its IoT revenues surge more than 39% over the last two years.With these two tailwinds propelling it along, Cypress could be the semiconductor stock to beat. Source: ShutterstockLike CY,  (NASDAQ:  ) is making its turnaround work. Historically, ON was a maker of strictly low-margined, high-comedized memory chips. That was fine, but memory chips aren't exactly a booming business. To counteract its low growth state, ON's management decided to move into higher-margined chips. Starting in 2016, the semiconductor firm made some strategic moves - including a big buyout - to enter new markets. That includes automotive power management and high-tech sensor market.New end-users in medicine, lighting and industrial IoT have managed to boost revenues and profits at ON. ON recorded more than  . That's a 51% jump in sales over what it made in 2016. Moreover, profits have more than doubled as these newer chips come with higher margins.Clearly, ON's turnaround and newfound focus is working. And with demand for advanced chips in automobiles, equipment and power management solutions in data centers only growing, the firm has long runway for future revenue growth. Management is calling for the stock to pull in around $7.1 billion in sales by 2020.However, shares of ON can be had for a dirt-cheap P/E of just 14. That makes ON one of the biggest values among the semiconductor stocks. Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) is a bit different than the other semiconductor stocks on this list. That's because it doesn't actually make chips itself, but makes the machines that enable other firms to make chips. But the key is that ASML's technology is what has allowed many semiconductor stocks to really apply Moore's Law and shrink chips to fit more computing power into the same space or less.ASML lithography tools are needed to apply serious scale to cutting-edge chips. The best part is that ASML is only provider of  - a very specialized version of these machines. Each of these machines cost more than $100 million and absolutely necessary for all the firms on this list need it to make their potential happen. With demand surging for all sorts of specialized semis, ASML expects to sell  of these machines this year.With such a wide moat, rising sales and plenty of profits, ASML is one of the most shareholder-friendly semiconductor stocks out there. Last year alone, ASML managed to increase its payout by 50%. Over the last five years, that payout has grown by over 200%. Meanwhile, ASML has conducted several lucrative buyback programs.With demand rising for a variety of technologically advanced chips, ASML will be in the driver's seat for a long time. Investors could consider it the safer backdoor play in the sector.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@5 Semiconductor Stocks That Are Scorching Hot Buys@2019-03-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-semiconductor-stocks-that-are-scorching-hot-buys-2019-03-26

"fter a torrid 2018, chipmakers bounced back this year. Chip stocks collectively notched their best start to a year, boosting investors' sentiment amid lingering global growth concerns. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor, a fund that mostly tracks semiconductor stocks, has soared more than 20% since the beginning of this year, the best first-quarter performance since the fund's inception in 2000. The fund easily outperformed the broader S&P 500'S 12% rally so far this year. Chipmakers, in fact, have posted gains in 10 out of the last 12 weeks.Trade dispute between United States and China along with worries about China's economic well-being affected a few of the semiconductor industry bigwigs. Weak iPhone sales along with deceleration in cryptocurrency mining ventures further raised questions about weakening demand for chips. But, investors saw promising trends in the semiconductor industry this year, which eventually helped chip stocks climb more than 30% since the recent low touched on Dec 26, 2018.The Fed's patient stance with interest rate hikes has bolstered high-flying names such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  and Micron Technology, Inc.  . These companies have had the best start to a year. After all, rising rates do affect these stocks as investors adjust to a new environment.By the way, chipmakers have become more realistic about growth trends. The industry has recognized a glut of chips in the market and it's time to curb production. And that's exactly what Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra acknowledged and pledged to cut 5% of chip production. This lifted Micron's shares 9.6% to $43.99 on Mar 21, after touching an intraday high of $44.21. Largely, the PHLX Semiconductor Index increased 3.5% and closed at 1,441.83, just short of its record of 1,445.90 set on Mar 12.To top it, NVIDIA Corporation's  $6.8-billion bid to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox helped renew investors' faith on the beaten-down sector.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  , Xilinx Inc.  , Quanta Services Inc.  , Anthem Inc.  and Celgene Corp.  .Are Americans more confident about their economy despite Wall Street entering the 11th year of expansion this month? A recent CNN poll has revealed that 71% of U.S. people believe the economy is in good shape while 27% differ.U.S. consumers' net worth took a hit in 2018 owing to a stock market meltdown and tepid housing market conditions. However, the market recouped most of the losses on positive development on the trade war front and the Fed's dovish monetary stance. Despite warnings of an impending recession by some industry experts, a closer look at the U.S. economy has a different story to tell.A significant Wall Street rebound and the Fed's to be patient with further rate hikes open the floodgate of easy money supply to U.S. individuals.The three key stock market indexes have gained impressively so far in 2019, marking the best start by Wall Street in three decades. Year to date, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq have risen a respective 11.1%, 13% and 16.3%.The Fed is unlikely to change its benchmark interest rate structure in its two-day long FOMC meeting which will start on Mar 19. On Jan 30, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds target rate unchanged at the range of 2.25-2.50%.Per Powell, the central bank will maintain its dovish monetary stance at least for the time being. On Feb 27, in his testimony before the House Committee, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank will not downsize its $4-trillion balance sheet this year.On Mar 10, in an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Powell said that the U.S. economy will continue to grow in 2019 albeit at a slower pace. Fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. Powell ruled out concerns about a recession in the near future.Per a recent study conducted by NBC News/ Wall Street Journal, 53% of Americans think there will be no recession in the next 12 months while 33% are of the view that the economy may contract.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index for February surged to 131.4, its highest in four months. The consensus estimate was 124.8. Moreover, the Future expectation index (which tracks consumers' expectations for the next six months) jumped to 103.4 from 89.4.The U.S. economy added just 20,000 jobs in February, possibly due to the 35-day long partial government shutdown. Meanwhile, wage rate grew 0.4%. The unemployment rate also fell to the historic low of 3.8% from 4% in January. Inflation is well under control below the 2% benchmark set by the Fed.The 11-month trade dispute between the United States and China is possibly headed toward a solution. On Mar 12, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer said that the government is hopeful about a final deal with China within a few weeks. The two sides have reportedly come to an understanding about currencies. Negotiations are underway as to how China is going to protect U.S. intellectual properties.The U.S. economy is likely to maintain long-term growth albeit at a slow pace. Thus, it will be prudent to buy stocks that have rallied so far this year and have the potential to maintain it. We narrowed down our search on five such stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Chicago, IL - March 19, 2019 -  Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  as the Bull of the Day, Toll Brothers, Inc.  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Vale  , Xilinx  and Arista Networks  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: : isn't afraid of Airbnb as it continues to launch new hotel brands. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow earnings by the double digits in both 2019 and 2020.Hilton is a hospitality company with 16 brands covering more than 5,600 properties in 113 countries and territories. It operates a popular loyalty program, Hilton Honors, with more than 85 million members.On Feb 13, Hilton reported its fourth quarter results and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 10th quarter in a row.Earnings were $0.79 versus the consensus of $0.69.System-wide comparable RevPAR rose 2% for the quarter and 3% for the year. It saw strength in the international hotels, particularly in Europe.It also launched a new luxury collection brand, LXR Hotels & Resorts, in the quarter. Currently LXR Hotels has only one open location, in Dubai, but will be launching its second property, The Biltmore in Mayfair London. Both of these hotels were conversions.In the fourth quarter, Hilton opened 142 new hotels totaling 22,500 rooms. For the full year, it opened over 450 new hotels. Conversions from non-Hilton brands made up nearly 25% of the new rooms opened during the year.Hilton also expanded to 8 new countries and territories in 2018.Hilton gave guidance of system-wide RevPAR of between 1% and 3%.Earnings, adjusted for special items, is projected to be between $3.66 and $3.78.This was well above consensus of just $3.10.Therefore, it's not surprising that the analysts all raised their estimates following the report. 8 estimates were raised in the last 2 months which pushed the Zacks Consensus up to $3.76 from $3.10. That's at the high end of the company's guidance range.It's also a 34.7% increase in earnings.Analysts are bullish on 2020 too. 5 estimates were raised since the report for 2020 with the Zacks Consensus jumping to $4.17 from $3.64. That's another gain of 11%.Like many stocks, Hilton shares have surged 20.1% year-to-date. But on a 2-year basis, the shares have been trading in a narrow trading range.Can they break out?They're not cheap, with a forward P/E of 22.8.However, the company is shareholder friendly. It pays a dividend, currently yielding 0.7%.It's also buying back shares. To date, it has purchased $2.8 billion in shares and still has another $408 million remaining on its program.Travel is still hot. For those looking for experienced players in hospitality, then Hilton is one to keep on your short list. : is dealing with big uncertainty in the home buying market. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) was only recently able to give guidance for the quarter, and not the year.Toll Brothers builds luxury homes in the United States. It serves move-up, empty-nester, active-adult and second home buyers as well as renters in urban and suburban markets.It operates in 22 states and the District of Columbia.On Feb 26, Toll Brothers reported its first quarter fiscal 2019 results and beat the Zacks Consensus by 13 cents. Earnings were $0.76 versus the consensus of $0.63.It was the fifth beat in a row.Home sales revenue were up 12% to $1.32 billion as home building deliveries jumped 8% to 1,530.Net signed contracts fell 31% to $1.16 billion with contract units down 24% to 1,379.It blamed the fall in contracts on three things: difficult year-over-year comparison, a lack of current inventory in certain locations and the industry-wide slowdown that began in the second half of 2018.It did see improving demand trends during the month of February, but it wasn't enough to convince the company that the worst was over.It would only offer guidance for the second quarter, and not the entire fiscal year.It expects deliveries between 1,650 and 1,850 units with an average price of between $860,000 and $890,000.Gross margins are expected at about 23.1%, that's up from 22.5% in the year ago quarter.As a reminder that this isn't anything like the 2008 slowdown and that the home builders are much better managed, Toll's CFO, Martin Connor, stated, ""Our balance sheet remains solid. We ended our first quarter with total liquidity of $1.9 billion, including over $800 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.12 billion available under our revolving bank credit facility. We finished the quarter with a book value per share of approximately $33.""The analysts didn't like what they heard so they erred on the side of caution and cut full year estimates.6 estimates have been cut in the last month for fiscal 2019, pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $4.48 from $4.70 during that time. That's an earnings decline of 4.8% as it made $4.71 last year.6 estimates have also been cut on 2020 at the same time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to $4.52 from $4.88 in the last 30 days.In the  , focus on the money. Central Bank money, that is.First quarter earnings projections and GDP growth rates out there aren't pretty.But Bulls! Do not panic. And Bears? Do not celebrate. It has already come to pass. The Money Gods introduced some crafty stage theatrics. The  already proceeded to shower the global growth stage with more juice.""Machine,"" in this case, refers to the crane that held a god over the stage in ancient Greek and Roman drama.The literary device of  means to solve a seemingly intractable problem in a plot -- by adding in an unexpected character, object, or situation. twists often have the sense of being quite contrived. It seems like the author resorted to something he or she did not set up properly plot-wise.That is clearly the case with 2019. No one wanted weak fundamental data. Every one got weak fundamental data.On Wednesday, the FOMC's latest Summary of Economic Projections is likely to tamp down the ""dot plot."" This shows Fed Funds rate projections. Still, it would be a surprise to see all FOMC policy hikes removed for 2019.Want Powell's main message after the policy statement? It won't be a surprise. His statement should be the FOMC doesn't think it is done hiking. But it is nearing ""the neutral rate"" and remains ""patient"" towards timing its next move.No money act looks meaningful this time around. Juice has already been added to the 2019 plot.I have said it before, and I will say it again. You and I trade in a tidy fishbowl, not in the raging open ocean. That is my idiom for the  .Next, I list Reuters' five big world market themes. These are the ones most likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the Global Week Ahead.I re-ordered them, to show the relative importance for equity markets.U.S. unemployment is plumbing its lowest level in half a century, wages are ticking up but the Federal Reserve, meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, is not poised to snatch away the proverbial punch bowl.On Wall Street at least, the Fed's dovish 2019 conversion is paying off: The S&P 500 is up about 6 percent since the Fed's Jan 30 meeting signaled it was putting in abeyance a tightening policy that began in 2015.Labor shortages notwithstanding, the slowing economy is keeping prices in check, giving the central bank leeway to stand pat on interest rates after hiking four times in 2018. Compared to the Fed's 2 percent inflation target, producer inflation was up 1.9 percent in the year to February, while consumer inflation rose just 1.5 percent to its smallest annual gain in 2 1/2 years.The next reading of the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, is due on March 29. But that gauge rose 1.9 percent year-year in December.Already, money markets are building in some easing in 2020. By then, the Fed should have completed a review of how it manages its policy mandate of keeping prices stable and employment high.It's been a rough old time for Europe's economy, with momentum steadily waning last year even as the United States powered ahead. Growth warnings issued by the OECD and the European Central Bank have rattled investors further this year, as they try to assess what kind of toll the Eurozone has suffered from trade wars, Brexit and Italian debt concerns.But finally! There are some signs the nasty surprises are fading. Citi's well-known economic surprise index - a gauge showing how much economists have been over- or underestimating economic performance compared to what indicators actually deliver - now shows a cross-over between the Eurozone and the United States.That means negative surprises from economic indicators in the world's top economy have worsened dramatically in recent weeks. Eurozone data misses, meanwhile, have been less bad than previously recorded.Whether this run continues or not will become evident in coming days. First up on Tuesday, comes Germany's ZEW economic index. Purchasing manager indexes, a crucial forward-looking gauge, will be released on Friday from the United States, the Eurozone and Japan.To many economists, the Bank of Japan's forecasts have long seemed to be on the optimistic side. The key difference in views was the global outlook. Well, the world economy is slowing down and even if Japanese companies are awash with cash and no major central bank runs a looser policy than the BOJ, the No. 3 economy is still feeling the pinch.What's worse, inflation encounters less resistance on the downside than it does on the upside. So the BOJ is well and truly in a corner. There was little it could do at its March meeting save keeping policy unchanged and tempering its economic outlook predictions. But might the BOJ be forced to resort to further policy easing? That question is being asked of the ECB too, while central banks elsewhere - from Australia to the United States - may also have to cut rates.Upcoming data on Japan's trade and price growth will help investors determine what happens next. Policymakers will also be hoping for a resolution soon to the U.S.-China trade dispute. The data could intensify the debate on whether the BOJ's dogged adherence to a 2 percent inflation target means anything - finance minister Taro Aso predicted ""things could go wrong"" if the BOJ hung on to that goal.If at first you don't succeed, try and try again. And again and again. The UK Parliament has voted to extend the March 29 exit date but Prime Minister Theresa May is still hoping to railroad lawmakers into approving the EU divorce deal she's negotiated. The unpopular agreement has already been heavily rejected twice but prospects of a long delay or even another referendum that may reverse Brexit could well swing eurosceptic Tories over to her side. So a third ""meaningful"" vote, dubbed MV3, is planned for the coming week. If that fails, well, MV4 is already being touted.There is, of course, no guarantee an exasperated EU will play ball - all 27 remaining members have to agree the extension. And there are doubts a three-month delay will break the deadlock. If MV3 fails, the EU's March 21 summit will be key, first to see if it agrees an extension and second, whether it presses Britain for a delay of one year or more.With the parliamentary votes, meaningful or otherwise, grabbing the limelight, there's probably not much the Bank of England can add at its meeting on March 21. It's already said no-deal Brexit is a bad idea; any clarity on its policy intentions is likely only after the manner and timing of Brexit becomes evident.President Trump has told Boeing to ""figure it out fast."" That's probably good advice for the company, a long-standing stock market darling that's lost almost $28 billion, or 13 percent of its value, since the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines' crash.The disaster has prompted country after country into grounding Boeing's fleet of 737 MAX aircraft - the model involved in the Ethiopian crash and another recent one in Indonesia. Possible links between the accidents have rocked the aviation industry, scared passengers worldwide, and left the company scrambling to prove the safety of its best-selling model that was intended to be the standard for decades.Before the crash, Boeing was the seventh most valued stock on the Dow Jones, but it's fallen to 14th. Its shares hit record highs just a week before the crash, having risen a stunning 52 percent since the end of December. They are still up almost 20 percent year-to-date.So what's next? Moody's reckons Boeing will overcome the near-term challenges. The question for investors is whether the share price slide takes into account the damage to the bottom line and potential legal exposure. Analysts will be assessing the possible fallout; chances are, some earnings downgrades will start coming through. Yes, it is actually on our #1 list. But the weekend's court order shutting more of its iron ore mines should take the stock down.I see a Zacks VGM score of A too. That's just more good stock fundamentals to ignore, when the actual company is struggling. There will be a big Micron EPS report after the market close on Wednesday, March 20th. This is the top semiconductor stock at the moment.However, it has a Zacks VGM score of F. This is a $22B market cap stock in the hot communication components industry. It is worth checking out. The share price is a mind-boggling $296, though.You are coming late to the party. The Zacks VGM score is D.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339Zacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

"ne chip company that has garnered a lot of attention from investors lately is  (NASDAQ: XLNX) . Xilinx, which has seen its shares rise nearly 44% year to date, primarily sells chips called field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs. These chips are unique in that their functionality can be reprogrammed on the fly by customers, which stands in stark contrast to most other chips, whose functionalities are set in stone at the time of production.Here, I would like to go over three of the most compelling long-term growth opportunities ahead of Xilinx.Image source: Xilinx.Although its data center segment made up just 21% of its total revenue last quarter, Xilinx isn't shy about the fact that it's a ""data center first"" company. Digging a bit deeper into the company's 2018 analyst day materials, it's not hard to see why that's the case.Xilinx's data center revenue is recorded as part of the company's data center and test, measurement, and emulation segment. According to the company's most recent analyst day presentation, the total addressable market (TAM) for that segment is set to grow from $2.3 billion in fiscal 2019 to an eye-popping $6.6 billion by fiscal 2023. The data center-specific part of that segment, per the company, should see its TAM rise from $600 million at the beginning of that forecast period to $4.6 billion by the end of it. (This also implies relatively modest growth in the test, measurement, and emulation part of that segment's TAM.)If the market really grows as rapidly as Xilinx thinks it will, then the ballooning TAM should help fuel multiple years of robust growth. So far, the growth here has been solid, with CEO Victor Peng claiming on the company's third-quarter  that its core data center revenue ""nearly doubled"" year over year.FPGAs are commonly used in communications infrastructure. In fact, 35% of the company's revenue last quarter came from sales into the communications market, making this its biggest business segment by revenue. Moreover, while the data center represents Xilinx's fastest-growing opportunity, the company still expects communications to represent its largest TAM by fiscal 2023, coming in at $7.3 billion by that time.In its analyst day presentation, Xilinx cited factors like the growing demand for bandwidth and the increased intelligence of networks as factors that help to expand the communications TAM. The imminent transition to 5G networks, Xilinx claims, is ""accelerating the evolution"" of communications infrastructure.What I found particularly interesting is that Xilinx actually presented a case study wherein it helped a major wireless network provider build out a large  radio. According to Xilinx, the company helped to dramatically reduce the number of chips that the customer needed to build that radio, bringing the total chip count from 24 to just four with its integrated RFSoC (this stands for ""radio frequency system-on-a-chip"").As a result of that, the customer apparently saw a 50% drop in power consumption and a 77% reduction in physical footprint. On top of all of that? Xilinx claims that its dollar content within the system itself rose by ""over 35%.""Xilinx's latest products look poised to bring power and cost savings to the communications infrastructure market -- something that looks like a winning value proposition to me.Xilinx also seems to be a good automotive chip play, too. According to the company, the proliferation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) is ""increasing the need for low latency, power efficient Edge Computing.""The company says that for this market, it's offering its Zynq system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions ""as a scalable platform across a broad base of applications.""On Xilinx's website, the company describes its Zynq-7000 family of chips as being suitable for ""highly differentiated designs for a wide range of embedded applications including multi-camera drivers assistance systems and 4K2K Ultra-HDTV.""From a big-picture perspective, though, what you need to know is this: Xilinx expects its automotive TAM to grow from $1.4 billion in fiscal 2019 to $2.7 billion by fiscal 2023 -- an 18% compound annual growth rate. If Xilinx can simply grow with the overall market (assuming the market forecast is in the right range), then that should translate into some pretty nice growth for its automotive efforts.The love that Xilinx is getting from investors isn't undeserved -- the company is delivering solid growth rates today and the markets that it's counting on to fuel its longer-term growth are large, growing, and seemingly increasingly amenable to FPGAs. The stock isn't terribly cheap right now, trading at just over 36 times the earnings per share (EPS) that analysts think the company will turn in this year. However, this is very much a high-quality company that looks set to deliver solid revenue and EPS growth in the coming years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Top Growth Opportunities for Xilinx@2019-03-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-growth-opportunities-xilinx-2019-03-18-0
ilinx (XLNX) closed at $127.06 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.42% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.01%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.12%.Coming into today, shares of the computer chipmaker had gained 5% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 4.57%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.24%.XLNX will be looking to display strength as it nears its nex  release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.94, up 46.88% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $824.88 million, up 22.59% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.49 per share and revenue of $3.05 billion, which would represent changes of +23.32% and +19.96%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for XLNX should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. XLNX is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Investors should also note XLNX's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 35.88. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 35.88, which means XLNX is trading at a no noticeable deviation to the group.Meanwhile, XLNX's PEG ratio is currently 2.99. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.99 as of yesterday's close.The Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 1, which puts it in the top 1% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Be sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" 52-week high level generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Notably, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overvalued.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in a bid to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain this positive trend and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more calculated approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an impending decline.

"re Americans more confident about their economy despite Wall Street entering the 11th year of expansion this month? A recent CNN poll has revealed that 71% of U.S. people believe the economy is in good shape while 27% differ.U.S. consumers' net worth took a hit in 2018 owing to a stock market meltdown and tepid housing market conditions. However, the market recouped most of the losses on positive development on the trade war front and the Fed's dovish monetary stance. Despite warnings of an impending recession by some industry experts, a closer look at the U.S. economy has a different story to tell.A significant Wall Street rebound and the Fed's to be patient with further rate hikes open the floodgate of easy money supply to U.S. individuals.The three key stock market indexes have gained impressively so far in 2019, marking the best start by Wall Street in three decades. Year to date, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq have risen a respective 11.1%, 13% and 16.3%.The Fed is unlikely to change its benchmark interest rate structure in its two-day long FOMC meeting which will start on Mar 19. On Jan 30, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds target rate unchanged at the range of 2.25-2.50%.Per Powell, the central bank will maintain its dovish monetary stance at least for the time being. On Feb 27, in his testimony before the House Committee, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank will not downsize its $4-trillion balance sheet this year.On Mar 10, in an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Powell said that the U.S. economy will continue to grow in 2019 albeit at a slower pace. Fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. Powell ruled out concerns about a recession in the near future.Per a recent study conducted by NBC News/ Wall Street Journal, 53% of Americans think there will be no recession in the next 12 months while 33% are of the view that the economy may contract.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index for February surged to 131.4, its highest in four months. The consensus estimate was 124.8. Moreover, the Future expectation index (which tracks consumers' expectations for the next six months) jumped to 103.4 from 89.4.The U.S. economy added just 20,000 jobs in February, possibly due to the 35-day long partial government shutdown. Meanwhile, wage rate grew 0.4%. The unemployment rate also fell to the historic low of 3.8% from 4% in January. Inflation is well under control below the 2% benchmark set by the Fed.The 11-month trade dispute between the United States and China is possibly headed toward a solution. On Mar 12, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer said that the government is hopeful about a final deal with China within a few weeks. The two sides have reportedly come to an understanding about currencies. Negotiations are underway as to how China is going to protect U.S. intellectual properties.The U.S. economy is likely to maintain long-term growth albeit at a slow pace.

"Chicago, IL - March 20, 2019 - Stocks in this week's article are  ,  ,  ,  and  .A 52-week high level generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Notably, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overvalued.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in a bid to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain this positive trend and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more calculated approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine. But powerful screening tools is just the start.

"Chicago, IL -March 18, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .On Mar 14, President Donald Trump said that the United States will probably get final information on a possible trade deal with China within the next three or four weeks. A deal between the two largest trading nations of the world will end a year-long bitter tariff war between them. Wall Street witnessed severe volatility throughout 2018 primarily owing to trade disputes. The technology sector was the worst sufferer of trade conflict and market volatility.However, since the beginning of 2019, positive developments on the trade war front have reinstated a bull run on Wall Street, putting the spotlight, not so surprisingly, on the technology sector yet again. A final solution to the trade dispute will be major boon for the technology sector. Consequently, it will be prudent to invest in tech stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential.The technology sector carries the highest weightage (20.1%) within the 11 sectors of the broad-market S&P 500 index. Technology stocks suffered a severe setback in 2018 and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) declined 2.9%. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.9% in 2018. However, in 2019, XLK is the best performer of the S&P 500, gaining more than 16.7%. The Nasdaq Composite is also up a little more than 15%.Within the technology sector, the performance of semiconductors is worth mentioning as the industry had a rough 2018. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) was down 2.6% last year. However, the SOX has advanced 16.1% year to date.China is the largest trading partner of the United States. A trade spat with the United States resulted in significant slowdown of the Chinese economy. However, a strong Chinese economy will give U.S. technology companies a solid boost as China is the largest market for high-tech products. Notably, the IMF has identified trade war as the primary factor for a perceived global economic slowdown in 2019.On the other hand, China also plays the role of a low-cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high-tech U.S. industries. In 2018, the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinses imports worth $300 billion in two phases. Most of these products are from the high-tech industrial sectors. U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it raised prices of high-tech equipment and several electronics products.Most importantly, the major concern of the Trump administration was the intellectual property theft by Chinese companies in the guise of producing goods for the American tech giants. National security concerns lead to the imposition of tariffs.At this juncture, an amicable solution to the U.S. - China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth, which in turn will create demand for high-tech U.S. products. Likewise, repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U.S. tech giants. Moreover, clinching a lasting agreement with China, which will strictly protect U.S. intellectual properties, will be immensely beneficial for U.S. tech behemoths.The technology sector is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation. The last few years witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet-of-Things (IoT), which have set the stage for robust growth. Research firm IDC estimates that worldwide technology spending on IoT will reach $1.2 trillion by 2022.At this stage, it will be lucrative to invest in tech stocks to gain from a possible U.S. - China trade solution. We have been able to narrow down our search to five stocks, which have moved higher and still hold potential provide further upside. All five stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Chicago, IL -March 18, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .The semiconductor industry's lackluster performance since late 2018 could turn around soon. The chip-making industry is primarily boosted by an uptick in data center segment, the reviving demand for chips and a possible U.S.-China trade deal.Semiconductor stocks powered the equity markets until last fall, largely driven by chip-making giants such as Nvidia. But the industry soon plummeted, dragged down by trade tensions and China's economic slowdown.Although some segments of the industry are witnessing growth, many others encountered a decline in sales late last year. However, the industry is already witnessing a revival this year. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Index has gained 17.3% year to date.This recovery is being largely propelled by positive news from Nvidia and Apple. Earlier this week, Nvidia announced its decision to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox Technologies for $6.8 billion in a bid to expand its data center business. Nvidia aims to enhance its reach in networking and connectivity on the back of its customized solutions and Mellalox's know-how.Also, Apple's stock was upgraded to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" by Bank of America earlier this week, raising the 12-month price target to $210 from $180. The bank attributed its decision to the prospect of upbeat comparable store sales in 2019, a potential U.S.-China trade agreement and prospects of a huge buyback authorization in April.The bank also recently cited several risks that the sector faces. However, the iPhone maker's price performance has witnessed an upward movement after suffering terribly in the fourth quarter. The company's shares have outperformed the broader S&P 500 Index (16.4% vs 12.2%) on a year-to-date basis.Apart from the macroeconomic factors involved, the recent turbulence in the semiconductor industry is largely the result of its cyclical nature. It is notable that despite weak demand in late 2018, global chip sales increased 13.7% on a year-over-year basis to $468.8 billion last year, Semiconductor Industry Association  . The 2018 sales figure happens to be the chip industry's highest annual total yet.In addition, RBC Capital Markets has forecast that the semiconductor industry will run out of steam around mid-2019 only to rise in the second half of the year. These reports could make the semiconductor space appealing to investors.The emergence and fast evolution of new technologies such as 5G wireless networks, cloud computing, Internet-of-things and artificial intelligence have created a renewed demand for semiconductor chips. Chips are used to command everything from autonomous vehicles, data centers and video games in today's world.Semiconductors are the main components that power hi-tech instruments, thus helping businesses perform efficiently and improving lives of consumers. It is this need for an enhanced technological experience that is pushing demand for chips and in turn driving semiconductor stock prices.Therefore, it would be advisable to invest in semiconductor stocks at this point.

" .  in collaboration with Xilinx  , Arm and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited  recently introduced Arm Neoverse N1 System Development Platform (""SDP"").Neoverse N1 SDP is touted to be the industry's first infrastructure development platform based on TSMC's 7 nanometer (nm) process which is verified by Cadence's robust tool flow. The latest SDP utilizes Cadence IP for PCI Express (PCIe) Gen 4, DDR4 PHY IP and CCIX.The SDP features Arm's Neoverse N1-based system-on-chip (""SoC"") which runs on operating frequency of 2.6-3GHz. Moreover, the SDP based on Cadence's latest 7 nm optimized system IP is loaded with high bandwidth memory and full-sized cache.Notably, in September 2017, Cadence partnered with Xilinx and TSMC for the development of CCIX based on 7 nanometer (nm) FinFET (Fin Field Effect Transistor) technology scheduled for delivery in 2018.Coming to price performance, shares of Cadence have returned 56.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming the  's rally of 19%.The Neoverse N1 SDP is primarily aimed at providing software and hardware developers a robust platform to customize the design of Arm's Neoverse N1 SoCs on TSMC's 7nm silicon technology.By utilizing the platform which provides a sturdy cloud-to-edge architecture, developers can build advance edge computing applications.Per the press release, ""The robustness of the SDP is ideal for development, debug, performance optimization and workload analysis on a wide range of applications including those for machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics.""In a bid to further enhance data center performance and reduce total cost of ownership (""TCO""), developers can use Xilinx's Alveo U280 Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (""CCIX"") accelerator card. Notably, the CCIX card connects the SDP with Xilinx's Virtex UltraScale+ FPGAs, which aids developers in designing applications with improved efficiency.Notably, Arm's Neoverse N1 SoC offers around 30% greater compute efficiency gain compared with prior Neoverse infrastructure CPUs. Moreover, the N1 platform can be scaled from sub-35W systems to big hyperscale cloud data servers.The efficiency and scalability features of the CPU are amplified when combined with Cadence's robust workflow based on TSMC's 7nm and Xilinx's accelerator card.Furthermore, the developers can access software stack of Neoverse N1 SDP via GitHub and Linaro open-source repositories.The Neoverse N1 SDP is slated to be available in second quarter of 2019 in restricted quantities with availability ofhigher volumesscheduled in subsequent quarters. Notably, the Neoverse N1 Rapid Adoption Kit (RAK) is available.Cadence is leaving no stone unturned to assist its customers in reducing time-to-market by accelerating their SoC design processes.The company is benefiting from robust adoption of the company's PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express) and DDR products in the IP segment.Further, Cadence is focusing on providing end-to-end solutions, which rapidly reduces the time required to introduce a semiconductor product in the market. In this regard, the company's frequent product launches and enhancements bode well.In fact, the company recently rolled out LPDDR5 IP solution utilizing TSMC's 7 nm FinFET process technology. Notably, Cadence Denali Gen2 IP, the ""industry's first"" silicon-based as well as LPDDR5 (Low-Power Double Data Rate) standard IP solution, is available.Notably, Cadence's buyout of nusemi inc, a company that develops high-speed Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) communications IP, to complement its existing SerDes solutions, deserves a special mention.With the integration of nusemi's technologies, Cadence is well poised to deliver efficient, cost saving and high bandwidth functionality for telecom segments, edge computing and networking services.Moreover, increasing investments on Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity.Furthermore, growing clout of Cadence's IP solutions particularly in the edge-computing and high performance computing (HPC) end-market holds promise. In fact, per Grand View Research estimates, HPC market is projected to witness a CAGR of 7.2% to reach $59.65 billion by 2025.We believe that incremental adoption of the offerings will favor financial performance of IP segment going ahead.Currently, Cadence sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Synopsys, Inc.  is another top-ranked stock in the same industry flaunting a Zacks Rank #1.

"The consolidation wave in the semiconductor space continues. The latest deal was announced today, with  (NASDAQ:  ) agreeing to shell out  for  (NASDAQ:  ). But of course, there were various bidders for the deal, like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Yet perhaps the most interesting was  (NASDAQ:  ). So far the impact on Intel stock has been negligible, but I still believe the merger is concerning for INTC. Source: ShutterstockThe merger does make a lot of sense for both MLNX and NVDA, as both companies have been long-time partners. They also are leaders in the category for high-performance computing. NVIDA, for example, develops GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) whereas Mellanox focuses on technologies for internet connections. (Both companies developed the world's two fastest super computers for the U.S. Department of Energy.) With the transaction, the combined company will power more than 250 of the world's 500 largest supercomputers. So then, what are the implications of the NVDIA/Mellanox combination? Well, so far, the impact on the INTC stock price is negligible. INTC is up about 2.5% since the announcement. And yes, as has been the case with many other tech operators, INTC stock has been rallying lately, up about 18% since late December.Yet I think the merger should still be concerning (hey, after all, it was Intel's former CEO Andy Grove who once said ""Only the paranoid survive"").Generally, the company's deal making has been relatively quiet. It most recently acquired Mobileye in March 2017 for  . But if anything, I think Intel should have been more aggressive in going after MLNX.The reason? For the most part, it's about AI (artificial intelligence). The market is ripe for secular growth and should be a driver for Intel stock.According to a report from International Data Corporation (IDC), the  for AI and cognitive technologies is expected to go from $24 billion in 2018 to a whopping $77.6 billion in 2022. This is a 37.3% annual growth rate.A key for this will be creating next-generation chips and networking systems. As NVIDIA's press release  :""Datacenters in the future will be architected as giant compute engines with tens of thousands of compute nodes, designed holistically with their interconnects for optimal performance.""A critical piece of this will be the kind of technology that MLNX offers. Keep in mind that its InfiniBand interconnect technology is becoming a must-have for hyperscale datacenters. It may also prove essential for autonomous vehicles and the development of next-generation quantum computers.Now it's true that INTC has not been sitting by and doing nothing. The company has been ramping its efforts with high-performance computing - such as with its Cascade Lake semiconductors - and has a strong InfiniBand business.INTC has also been investing much more in AI. For example, there is the Intel Nervana Neural Network Processor for Inference (NNP-I), a system that's built specifically to handle deep learning models. As a testament to the technology, INTC has partnered with  (NASDAQ:  ), which should allow for testing with huge amounts of data.What's more, INTC has plans to integrate AI capabilities in its 10nm PC processor. This chip is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.All in all, I still think the bull case remains intact for Intel stock. The product roadmap looks solid and the company has a massive global infrastructure. So INTC should see growth in the years to come.Intel stock price is also at a reasonable valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at a mere 11x. The dividend is at a decent 2.4% as well.Granted, even though I think Intel stock lost an opportunity with MLNX, it is not a decision that will derail the company. But going forward, it may be a good idea for management to be willing to pay higher premiums, especially as the chip market continues to get more competitive.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Nvidia Acquires Mellanox: What Does the Deal Mean for Intel Stock?@2019-03-12@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-acquires-mellanox-what-does-deal-mean-intel-stock-2019-03-12
" recently announced the launch of a storage virtualization solution, NVMe SNAP (Software-defined, Network Accelerated Processing).Notably, SNAP technology enables customers to create remote server-connected NVMe flash storage. Users can avail high-efficiency attributes of the remote storage platform, which virtualizes local physical storage infrastructure.Also, users can avail robust data protection, advanced manageability and efficiency capabilities of local SSD in remote storage platform.The expansion of company's BlueField SmartNIC adapters' portfolio with NVMe SNAP is in sync with growing demand for enterprise data storage requirements of flash storage arrays, virtualized and cloud datacenters. The latest solution, is likely to enable data centers to maximize return on investment (ROI) from the flash storage investments.Mellanox is demonstrating NVMe SNAP technology at the 2019 Open Compute Project (""OCP"") Global Summit in San Jose, CA.Coming to price performance, shares of Mellanox have returned 61.2% in the past year, substantially outperforming the  's rally of 5.8%.NVMe SNAP combines BlueField's robust platform comprising RDMA offload engines, multicore Arm processors and virtual switch. This accelerates software defined networking (""SDN"") storage processes, distributed file systems, de-duplication, artificial intelligence (AI), and many other cloud and enterprise computing applications.The solution is expected to aid data centers in realizing cloud scale composability and storage disaggregation as required.Furthermore, NVMe SNAP enables accelerated deployment of NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) across data center infrastructure by providing integration into data servers with any operating system or hypervisor.Mellanox is witnessing massive demand for BlueField (system-on-a-chip device) from the world's leading hyperscale cloud providers and storage companies.The need to access and process data at a faster speed (25, 50 and 100 Gb/s) due to data growth in data centers is increasing demand for high-performance and efficient storage solutions.Increasing bandwidth and growing capacity of data centers in this connected data-intensive era are other notable factors advancing the adoption of BlueField solutions. Further, SmartNICs utilized to virtualize and share flash storage make data centers more efficient.To quote chief analyst at Futuriom, a market research firm, R. Scott Raynovich, ""A SmartNIC like BlueField that can both virtualize flash storage and accelerate SDN has tremendous potential with cloud and large enterprise customers.""In fact, Melaanox's latest NVMe SNAP solution is already witnessing adoption. For instance, NVMe SNAP is enabling JD.com to devise ""a composable infrastructure"" which addresses the company's growing storage needs.""E8 Storage aims to virtualize all-flash arrays like local NVMe storage across many of its server platforms with NVMe SNAP solution.Notably, Excelero is optimistic about integrating its NVMesh storage solution with NVMe SNAP. This is anticipated to aid Excelero broaden the access of its NVMesh solution to wide range of hypervisors and operating systems.Robust innovations in Mellanox's Ethernet adapters, switches and cables are anticipated to bolster adoption further.IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 175 zettabytes (that is a trillion gigabytes), from 33 zettabytes in 2018. This exponential growth is expected to favor adoption of Mellanox's interconnect solutions driven by growing demand for higher network speeds for fast processing of data.Moreover, per ResearchAndMarkets data, the global data center storage market is projected to increase at a CAGR of 11.8% from 2018 through 2022. Per MarketsandMarkets report, the non-volatile memory market is projected to witness a CAGR of 9.5% to reach approximately $82 billion by 2022.The aforementioned reports reflect robust demand for NVMe based cloud storage systems in data centers, which in turn strengthen the prospects of the latest solution.Mellanox is benefiting from solid demand of its Gigabit EDR solutions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, database and storage.Further, robust demand for Mellanox'sInfiniBand solutions is a key catalyst. The company has also won several contracts from the likes of NetApp, the University of Toronto and NASA Ames Research Center, which reflects sturdy demand for its solutions.Recently, NVIDIA  the acquisition of Mellanox reportedly outbidding Intel  and Xilinx  .The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2019.Mellanox currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"ne chip company that has garnered a lot of attention from investors lately is . Xilinx, which has seen its shares rise nearly 44% year to date, primarily sells chips called field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs. These chips are unique in that their functionality can be reprogrammed on the fly by customers, which stands in stark contrast to most other chips, whose functionalities are set in stone at the time of production. Here, I would like to go over three of the most compelling long-term growth opportunities ahead of Xilinx.Image source: Xilinx.Although its data center segment made up just 21% of its total revenue last quarter, Xilinx isn't shy about the fact that it's a ""data center first"" company. Digging a bit deeper into the company's 2018 analyst day materials, it's not hard to see why that's the case.Xilinx's data center revenue is recorded as part of the company's data center and test, measurement, and emulation segment. According to the company's most recent analyst day presentation, the total addressable market (TAM) for that segment is set to grow from $2.3 billion in fiscal 2019 to an eye-popping $6.6 billion by fiscal 2023. The data center-specific part of that segment, per the company, should see its TAM rise from $600 million at the beginning of that forecast period to $4.6 billion by the end of it. (This also implies relatively modest growth in the test, measurement, and emulation part of that segment's TAM.)If the market really grows as rapidly as Xilinx thinks it will, then the ballooning TAM should help fuel multiple years of robust growth. So far, the growth here has been solid, with CEO Victor Peng claiming on the company's third-quarter  that its core data center revenue ""nearly doubled"" year over year.FPGAs are commonly used in communications infrastructure. In fact, 35% of the company's revenue last quarter came from sales into the communications market, making this its biggest business segment by revenue. Moreover, while the data center represents Xilinx's fastest-growing opportunity, the company still expects communications to represent its largest TAM by fiscal 2023, coming in at $7.3 billion by that time. In its analyst day presentation, Xilinx cited factors like the growing demand for bandwidth and the increased intelligence of networks as factors that help to expand the communications TAM. The imminent transition to 5G networks, Xilinx claims, is ""accelerating the evolution"" of communications infrastructure. What I found particularly interesting is that Xilinx actually presented a case study wherein it helped a major wireless network provider build out a large  radio. According to Xilinx, the company helped to dramatically reduce the number of chips that the customer needed to build that radio, bringing the total chip count from 24 to just four with its integrated RFSoC (this stands for ""radio frequency system-on-a-chip""). As a result of that, the customer apparently saw a 50% drop in power consumption and a 77% reduction in physical footprint. On top of all of that? Xilinx claims that its dollar content within the system itself rose by ""over 35%.""Xilinx's latest products look poised to bring power and cost savings to the communications infrastructure market -- something that looks like a winning value proposition to me.Xilinx also seems to be a good automotive chip play, too. According to the company, the proliferation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) is ""increasing the need for low latency, power efficient Edge Computing."" The company says that for this market, it's offering its Zynq system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions ""as a scalable platform across a broad base of applications.""On Xilinx's website, the company describes its Zynq-7000 family of chips as being suitable for ""highly differentiated designs for a wide range of embedded applications including multi-camera drivers assistance systems and 4K2K Ultra-HDTV.""From a big-picture perspective, though, what you need to know is this: Xilinx expects its automotive TAM to grow from $1.4 billion in fiscal 2019 to $2.7 billion by fiscal 2023 -- an 18% compound annual growth rate. If Xilinx can simply grow with the overall market (assuming the market forecast is in the right range), then that should translate into some pretty nice growth for its automotive efforts.The love that Xilinx is getting from investors isn't undeserved -- the company is delivering solid growth rates today and the markets that it's counting on to fuel its longer-term growth are large, growing, and seemingly increasingly amenable to FPGAs. The stock isn't terribly cheap right now, trading at just over 36 times the earnings per share (EPS) that analysts think the company will turn in this year. However, this is very much a high-quality company that looks set to deliver solid revenue and EPS growth in the coming years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@3 Top Growth Opportunities for Xilinx@2019-03-18@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-growth-opportunities-xilinx-2019-03-18
"n Mar 14, President Donald Trump said that the United States will probably get final information on a possible trade deal with China within the next three or four weeks. A deal between the two largest trading nations of the world will end a year-long bitter tariff war between them. Wall Street witnessed severe volatility throughout 2018 primarily owing to trade disputes. The technology sector was the worst sufferer of trade conflict and market volatility.However, since the beginning of 2019, positive developments on the trade war front have reinstated a bull run on Wall Street, putting the spotlight, not so surprisingly, on the technology sector yet again. A final solution to the trade dispute will be major boon for the technology sector. Consequently, it will be prudent to invest in tech stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank and strong growth potential.The technology sector carries the highest weightage (20.1%) within the 11 sectors of the broad-market S&P 500 index. Technology stocks suffered a severe setback in 2018 and Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) declined 2.9%. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.9% in 2018. However, in 2019, XLK is the best performer of the S&P 500, gaining more than 16.7%. The Nasdaq Composite is also up a little more than 15%.Within the technology sector, the performance of semiconductors is worth mentioning as the industry had a rough 2018. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) was down 2.6% last year. However, the SOX has advanced 16.1% year to date.China is the largest trading partner of the United States. A trade spat with the United States resulted in significant slowdown of the Chinese economy. However, a strong Chinese economy will give U.S. technology companies a solid boost as China is the largest market for high-tech products. Notably, the IMF has identified trade war as the primary factor for a perceived global economic slowdown in 2019.On the other hand, China also plays the role of a low-cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high-tech U.S. industries. In 2018, the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinses imports worth $300 billion in two phases. Most of these products are from the high-tech industrial sectors. U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it raised prices of high-tech equipment and several electronics products.Most importantly, the major concern of the Trump administration was the intellectual property theft by Chinese companies in the guise of producing goods for the American tech giants. National security concerns lead to the imposition of tariffs.At this juncture, an amicable solution to the U.S. - China trade war is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth, which in turn will create demand for high-tech U.S. products. Likewise, repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods will raise the profit margin of U.S. tech giants. Moreover, clinching a lasting agreement with China, which will strictly protect U.S. intellectual properties, will be immensely beneficial for U.S. tech behemoths.The technology sector is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation. The last few years witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing, predictive analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and Internet-of-Things (IoT), which have set the stage for robust growth. Research firm IDC estimates that worldwide technology spending on IoT will reach $1.2 trillion by 2022.At this stage, it will be lucrative to invest in tech stocks to gain from a possible U.S. - China trade solution.

"onfirming earlier rumors,  announced the acquisition of high-speed interconnects and networking solutions provider Mellanox Technologies  for $125 per share in cash. This represents a total enterprise value of roughly $6.9 billion, higher than Intel's  $6 billion offer made in January 2019.Per CNBC, the all-cash offer represented a premium of 14% to Mellanox's closing price on Mar 8. The ""definitive"" agreement followed a bidding process tha  edly included Intel and chipmaker Xilinx  . Per TechCrunch, Microsoft was also interested in Mellanox.The Israel-based Mellanox is one of the major suppliers of 25, 40, 50 and 100GB Ethernet adapters, switches and cables. Per Crehan research estimates, the company had a market share of 69% in the high-speed Ethernet adapter business during third-quarter 2018, leaving Intel, Broadcom and other peers trailing.Further, robust demand for its InfiniBand solutions is noteworthy. Mellanox's customers include datacenter owners and also the companies that build datacenter. Notable clients include Alibaba, JD.com, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.In fact, NVIDIA computing platform and Mellanox's interconnects support more than 250 of the world's TOP500 supercomputers, including the world's two fastest supercomputers, Sierra and Summit, operated by the U.S. Department of Energy.The deal is immediately accretive to NVIDIA's non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2019. | NVIDIA's takeover of Mellanox will definitely expand its market share in datacenter space. The Mellanox combination now also makes the company a preferable choice for hyperscale customers. Moreover, the deal will help in reducing NVIDIA's overdependence on the gaming industry.Management at NVIDIA stated that ""With Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize datacenter-scale workloads across the entire computing, networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating cost for customers.""In fact, the acquisition expands NVIDIA's total addressable market (TAM) by more than $60 billion (includes $50 billion in computing and $11 billion in high-speed networking).Notably, datacenter accounts for almost 30% of total revenues. In the last-reported quarter, datacenter sales slowed down due to lower hyperscale and cloud purchases along with a temporary pause in cloud spending. However, with growth in AI-related investments by cloud giants, demand is likely to pick up, and the Mellanox acquisition is a key catalyst in this regard.Moreover, the deal strengthens NVIDIA's competitive position against the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices  , particularly in the datacenter space.The completion of the NVIDIA's Mellanox deal is subject to regulatory approval in China, which can be a headwind. Per Bloomberg, both the companies generate significant amount of sales from China, the biggest market for semiconductors. Notably, Alibaba and Baidu are two big Chinese customers of Mellanox.However, given the uncertainty in trade relationships amid the unsolved trade dispute between the United States and China, the approval is not guaranteed. Moreover, protectionist policies currently followed by both the countries, particularly China in this case, can be a big roadblock for the deal.For instance, Qualcomm failed to seal the NXP Semiconductors NV acquisition deal after it didn't receive China's approval. The United States also vetoed Broadcom's acquisition offer for Qualcomm in 2018.Nevertheless, NVIDIA expects that it will get the approvals by the end of the year. Notably, per agreement, Mellanox will pay a $350-million termination to NVIDIA if it accepts a rival offer. However, a regulatory roadblock will be detrimental for both the stocks.NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Mellanox has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It cited estimates that Nvidia would pay at least 10% more than the price offered by Intel.

" (NASDAQ: XLNX) has captured Wall Street's imagination over the past year or so thanks to  in spite of the broader semiconductor industry weakness. The chipmaker has benefited from its strategy of going after fast-growing niches such as artificial intelligence chips used in data centers and fifth-generation wireless technology infrastructure.Unsurprisingly, Xilinx shares continued their impressive run after i  ed  . However, the same cannot be said about  supplier  (NASDAQ: QRVO) , whose stock price sank after its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 fell behind expectations. That's not surprising as Qorvo reportedly relies on Apple for just over a third of its revenue and Apple has seen iPhone weakness.But a closer look at Qorvo's guidance and the outlook for the long run suggests that it won't be long before it gets back on track and starts delivering growth.Image Source: Getty Images.Xilinx is benefiting big time from early  wireless deployments in South Korea, China, and North Korea. Its communications revenue shot up 41% annually last quarter, outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of 34%. Qorvo's lates  indicates that it is enjoying a similar boost from 5G deployments.In fact, the company's infrastructure and defense products (IDP) revenue grew in the double digits annually for the  to a record $230 million in the third quarter. According to Qorvo CFO Mark Murphy, ""strong growth in infrastructure as carriers pick up the pace of their 5G investments"" was one of the key drivers behind the 14% year-over-year jump in this segment.The chipmaker is looking at current-quarter earnings of $1.05 per share on revenue of $670 million. That's not bad considering that it generated $665 million in revenue in the prior-year period and earnings of $1.07 per share.What's more, the 5G catalyst seems to be strong enough to help Qorvo mitigate the mobile weakness caused by Apple as the nearly flat top-line forecast for the current quarter suggests.However, investors shouldn't forget that Qorvo still relies on its mobile segment for around 73% of revenue. In the most recent quarter, revenue from this segment was down 6% annually on account of weak sales of flagship smartphones, especially in China.The fact that Qorvo's mobile revenue dropped in the mid-single digits is a testimony to the fact that it has a diversified client base that allowed it to weather the 15% drop in iPhone revenue that Apple saw in the quarter that ended in late December. However, Apple might continue weighing on Qorvo's performance in the near term.As such, Qorvo's mobile business is expected to remain under pressure given its dependence on Apple. But 5G devices could revitalize the smartphone market, with  predicting that sales of 5G smartphones will hit 65 million units in 2020, while a forecast by Strategy Analytics predicts 1.5 billion in annual shipments by 2025.Networking giant  believes that at least eight 5G smartphone models could hit the market by mid-2019. So it won't be surprising to see Qorvo's mobile business turn around sooner rather than later thanks to an increase in demand for its 5G smartphone modules.In all, 5G could fire up Qorvo's mobile and infrastructure businesses and pull it out of mediocrity, just like it did for Xilinx.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Qorvo wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Could This Chipmaker Be the Next Xilinx?@2019-02-28@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-chipmaker-be-next-xilinx-2019-02-28
he Wall Street bull run completed 10 years on Mar 9. Historically this is the longest bull run of the U.S. stock markets. During this period, the Dow has gained nearly 300%, the S&P 500 has jumped more than 400% and the Nasdaq Composite has surged nearly 500%.As a result of these enormous gains, several industry researchers have cautioned that the bull market is now too old with little room to run. A closer look at the U.S. economy has a different story to tell, with enough reasons for further rally.After a disappointing 2018, in which all the three major stock indexes closed in the red owing to severe volatility, Wall Street has made a spectacular comeback this year. The three Key indexes gained impressively in the first two months marking the best start by Wall Street in three decades. Year to date, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up 9.1%, 9.4% and 11.7%, respectively.On Feb 27, in his testimony before the House Committee, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank will not downsize its $4 trillion balance sheet this year. On Jan 30, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the federal funds target rate unchanged in the range of 2.25 - 2.50%. Per Powell, the central bank will maintain its dovish monetary stance at least for the time being. Notably, the Fed's aggressive monetary stance in 2018 was largely held responsible by industry watchers for the stock market mayhem in the fourth quarter.The 11-month long trade dispute between the United States and China is heading toward a likely resolution. On Feb 24, President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States is planning to delay tariffs on additional Chinese goods as trade-related negotiations have made substantial progress. CNBC reported that China has committed to import $1.2 trillion of U.S. exports.The U.S. economy added just 20,000 jobs in February, significantly below the consensus estimate of 186,000. However, this depressing job data may be due to the 35-day long partial government shutdown. On the positive side, wage rate grew 0.4% compared with the consensus estimate of 0.3%. The unemployment rate also declined to the historic low level of 3.8% from 4% in January.On Feb 28, the Department of Commerce reported that U.S. GDP for the fourth quarter of 2018 grew 2.6%. This figure was better than the consensus estimate of growth of 2.4%.The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index for February surged to 131.4, its highest level in four months. The consensus estimate was 124.8. Moreover, the Future expectation index (which tracks consumers' expectations for the next six months) jumped to 103.4 from 89.4.The U.S. economy is likely to maintain its long-term growth albite at a slow pace. Consequently, it will be prudent to buy stocks that have surged up significantly in the past year and still carry strong upside potential. We narrowed down our search on five such stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  . .  is a leading energy technologies company providing megawatt-scale solutions worldwide.

 delivered non-GAAP earnings of 10 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2018, higher than with 5 cents in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents.This 3D printer maker's revenues logged $180.7 million in the quarter under review, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 2%. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $185 million.The year-over-year improvement was driven by growth in printer unit and printer revenues in both metals and plastics as well as growth in software and healthcare solutions. However, the company's lower-priced products witness more demand, which in turn, is increasing the volatility in printer mix.The tough year-over-year comparison and export-compliance charges in the on-demand manufacturing business remain key challenges in the first half of 2019. Further, the price-mix is likely to remain a headwind this year.However, management is optimistic about the company's shift in its investment focus to materials innovations and software growth opportunities.3D Systems' Healthcare revenues were up 16% to $58.4 million year over year, driven by growth across all categories.The company's on-demand manufacturing revenues were up 5% to $27.7 million, aided by growth in a few large orders from industrial customers. However, headwinds related to export compliance and outsourcing changes remain dampeners.Printer revenues increased 17% and came in at $40.7 million. Meanwhile, printer unit sales skyrocketed 113%, driven by the company's launch of a printer priced at about $5,000.Software revenues rose 3% year over year to $26.7 million. Material revenues dipped 2% to $42 million due to a faster-than-expected decline in legacy materials. The company expects revival of materials growth during the second half of 2019.Geographically, revenues in Americas declined 6% while that of Europe and Asia Pacific increased 11% and 9%, respectively. | In the reported quarter, non-GAAP gross margin contracted 200 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 46.3%. This downside was mainly due to an unfavorable sales mix, increased investment to ramp up product portfolio and launch more in the near term plus lower on-demand manufacturing margins, which more than offset the cost-reduction benefits, achieved from the ongoing supply-chain initiatives.In the quarter under consideration, the company's non-GAAP operating expenses rose 2% to $75.7 million due to the company's persistent investment in new product development and launches, go-to-market strategy, IT infrastructure plus operational improvements. Non-GAAP SG&A increased 4% while non-GAAP R&D expense slipped 2% in the quarter under discussion.3D Systems ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $110 million compared with $92.1 million in the previous quarter.The company generated $7.7 million of cash in operational activities during the fourth quarter.A few stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector are CommVault Systems, Inc.  , eGain Corporation  and Fortinet Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for CommVault, eGain and Fortinet is projected at 15.8%, 30% and 16.8%, respectively.In addition to the stocks discussed above, wouldn't you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?From more than 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank, these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market.

 recently took a few back-to-back steps in the network security and enterprise security spaces.It announced the general availability of the Unisys Stealth (identity) biometric identity management software along with the launch of Unisys Stealth 4.0, which will be available from Apr 15. Also, it introduced Unisys Managed Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), a platform to manage the authentication process undertaken by organizations on users and devices on their networks.The announcements did not come as a surprise, as in its last  , Unisys had hinted that it intends to release two new Stealth products this year, which will leverage artificial intelligence and biometrics.Unisys Stealth 4.0 is designed to identify potentially risky users and devices on a client organization's network and swiftly isolate them. With the rising adoption of cloud, mobile and the Internet of Things, various threats are constantly cropping up in the digital landscape, making it difficult for organizations to keep a track of the vulnerabilities.The Stealth 4.0 has been integrated with LogRhythm security incident and event management system as well as with Palo Alto Networks'  Panorama network security management console to help clients respond quickly to the threats and enable strong network visibility and visualization.This new software, part of the Stealth suit of products, has been devised to strengthen security in enterprises by leveraging its fingerprint, face, voice and iris recognition and behavioral biometrics capabilities.Identity fraud, if not kept in check, can compromise national security. Moreover, per a study by Javelin Strategy & Research, identity fraud impacted 16.7 million individuals in the United States in 2018, leading to a total loss of $16.8 billion. This makes it very important to take stringent measures against identity and access management risks.In further efforts in identity management, Unisys launched this new platform to create and manage digital certificates that authenticate the identities of users and devices, which is necessary for organizations to secure financial transactions, e-commerce, internet banking and email.Unisys Managed PKI is powered by HydrantID, and is designed to suit the Zero Trust security model, which is being increasingly adopted by organizations that are realizing the need to shift from traditional security controls to combat new-generation cyber-attacks.Unisys has a strong product line in its Technology segment, and is expanding its distribution capabilities by building new reseller channels.In the las  ed quarter, the company benefited from the expanding Stealth portfolio. Revenues from the segment witnessed strong growth of 94% year over year. During the quarter, a large U.S. Department of Defense agency rented Stealth product authorization to provide secure zones to process and store sensitive government information in the agency's production environment.Notably, in December last year, Unisys was awarded the 2018 Tekne Cybersecurity Award for its Stealth family of software.The company's sustained investments in strategic high-potential products are expected to drive growth and boost results, going forward. | Unisys currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A couple of other top-ranked stock in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Xilinx, Inc.  and Fortinet, Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

he S&P 500 - popularly known as the benchmark index of U.S. stock markets - has been performing impressively so far in 2019. On Mar 1, the broad-market index closed at 2,800 - a key technical barrier - for the first time since Nov 8, 2018.A likely agreement between the United States and China on the trade war front, the Fed's dovish monetary stance, and rebound in  and technology sector acted as primary catalysts behind the stock market rally. Consequently, it will be prudent to invest in S&P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank.The last year was extremely disappointing for the S&P 500. The index plunged 6.2% recording its worst ever yearly performance since 2008. However, the S&P 500 started 2019 on a strong note. For the week ended Mar 1, the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, reflecting its fifth straight weekly gains. The benchmark index has witnessed growth in 9 out of last 10 weeks. Year to date, the broad-market index is up 11.8%.Notably, 2,800 is a key technical barrier for the S&P 500. Since the beginning of 2018, the index has entered this zone for 11 times but has been unable to hold the position.

Shares have added about 12.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Xilinx due for a pullback?

Revenues from core products (34% of total) increased 9% from the year-ago quarter.The company is witnessing robust growth in 28-nanometer and 16-nanometer Zynq SoC products. Sales of Zynq products grew 80% from the year-earlier quarter, aided by 16-nanometer MPSoC products. Moreover, strength across applications and communications, automotive, particularly ADAS, as well as industrial end markets were key drivers.On the basis of end markets, Communications revenues (35% of total revenues) grew 41% year over year. Growth in Wireless market, backed by early 5G production, pre-5G deployments and LTE upgrades, was a primary catalyst. Notably, 5G deployments in South Korea and a very early start of ramping up the 5G deployments in China drove results.Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (15% of total revenues) increased 20% year over year, attributable to an uptick in Broadcast. Meanwhile, Automotive remained flat while Consumers declined slightly.Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (27% of total revenues) rose 17% on a year-over-year basis, boosted by better-than-expected growth in A&D. However, a tad weaker Industrial segment was an overhang.Data Center and Test, Measurement & Emulation (TME) (21% of total) improved 14% from the year-ago period. Key design wins from hyperscalers globally for accelerating applications beyond FPGA as a Service (FaaS) bettered results. Moreover, with regard to FaaS, it had additional engagements beyond previously announced deployments with Amazon, Alibaba and Huawei.Excluding cryptocurrency, Data Center growth nearly doubled year over year.

Meanwhile, Industrial and A&D plus Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer might decline.Gross margin is anticipated to be around 68.5%. 5G deployment and a few other product mixes are a threat to gross margin. Operating expenses are predicted to be $305 million.The company envisions modest revenue growth from Alveo this year and is likely to become more meaningful in the next fiscal year.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted 14.3% due to these changes.At this time, Xilinx has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B.

"The tech world is continually undergoing extensive changes, with dominant incumbents ceding share to more-specialized niche players.This dynamic recently played out for  (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which became  over the past few years after its graphics processing units (GPUs) offered a more efficient way for companies of all types to do their computing.But even well-loved NVIDIA is now under attack. The stock fell more than 50% in the final three months of 2018, with  or  being possible reasons for Wall Street analysts tapering down their expectations.I agree that NVIDIA's troubles will continue, but for a different reason. One of NVIDIA's most important growth markets is the cloud computing data center. Yet I believe field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) will win out over GPUs in an industry that is quickly becoming a must-win battleground for NVIDIA. If that happens, the company's best growth days  .But what could take its place?I believe  (NASDAQ: XLNX) might be  to own in the tech space today because the company is extremely well positioned to capitalize on the industry's recent shifts. And that could mean big returns for investors.Image Source: Getty Images.FPGAs are chips that can have their logic programming continually changed, meaning they are adaptable to changing software requirements. This makes them a perfect fit for machine learning, which is constantly training and retraining its artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in order to optimize performance.Xilinx invented FPGA technology three decades ago, and it remains one of only two large companies focusing on it today. The other is  (NASDAQ: INTC) , which bought its way into FPGAs through its 2015 acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion.A price tag that hefty should immediately catch your attention. When the world's second-largest chipmaker shells out that kind of cash for a technology outside of its core competency, it's typically a sign that it is important.Intel is a massive company with a huge R&D budget, and one might even think that it could become the most formidable player in FPGAs. But the computing behemoth also has several other product lines competing to win share in data centers. It's quite likely that Altera simply isn't large enough, even internally within Intel, to hold its own against the marketing muscle of Intel's other products.On the contrary, Xilinx is laser-focused on FPGAs. It has designed and optimized the hardware, and now it's working on  to make its FPGAs easily usable by developers.The success of that ecosystem -- called the  (ACAP) -- will be  . Xilinx is working to perfect the fit between applications and hardware through what it describes as ""the most dynamic processing technology in the industry."" For large cloud vendors like  (NASDAQ: AMZN) , with its Web Services division (a Xilinx customer), that could mean maximizing application performance and minimizing data-center power costs.The ACAP will also be the key for FPGAs gaining mass-market adoption. Software developers don't care what's going on behind the scenes with Amazon's cloud computing hardware. But they do want a lower monthly bill to rent processing and storage, as well as to have an easy-to-use platform that will allow their apps to work with any of the cloud vendors.Technically, this won't be easy. There's a ton of programming that will be needed to build out Xilinx's invisible layer of abstraction, which is what would allow those developers to focus exclusively on the software and not on the hardware.But the optimized performance of FPGAs might make it worth it. FPGAs can be significantly more efficient and are more flexible than GPUs, so the long-term data center opportunity is really Xilinx's for the taking. If it can successfully execute on its strategy, it could transform itself from being a niche hardware company to a mass-market optimizer of cloud computing performance.Let's take a moment to quantify what that data center opportunity could be worth.Data centers aren't even close to being Xilinx's largest market today. They currently account for around $600 million of annual sales, representing around a fifth of the overall top line.Xilinx sees the combination of all of the markets it directly serves growing at 13% annually, rising from $14 billion in fiscal 2019 to $23 billion in 2023. That is respectable growth, but not outstanding.But it believes the opportunity within data centers -- specifically programmable logic hardware devices used in public clouds -- will increase much more significantly. IHS Markit (an information services firm) and Xilinx together estimate this niche market will grow at 67% per year, from $600 million in fiscal 2019 to $4.6 billion in 2023.Xilinx will be a prime contender to take advantage of this massive industry tailwind. Its ""data center first"" strategy looks to displace GPUs and application-specific integrated circuits at the largest cloud vendors.As noted above, FPGAs are an oligopoly, and Xilinx reportedly had 59%  share at the end of fiscal 2017 (Intel held the other 41%). If that market share split remains true in data centers, the segment could contribute $2.7 billion to Xilinx's fiscal 2023 revenue.And to put that number into context, Xilinx did $2.5 billion of total revenue in all of its markets combined last year. Data center revenue alone could be greater than that within the next four years.That estimate might initially sound overzealous, but the company is already off to a great start. Xilinx recently reported that its core product sales in data centers (excluding cryptocurrency mining) have already nearly doubled over last year. There appears to be a long growth runway, and Xilinx is accelerating on it.Image Source: Getty ImagesCloud and AI services are both still in their extremely early stages. Companies are learning more every day about how to use new software languages to write AI algorithms. The businesses that come to understand and embrace AI will mine insights and develop strong competitive advantages over their peers. They'll become the trailblazers of a new AI era.But behind the scenes, the true workhorses of this AI movement will be the data center hardware chips, which are tirelessly crunching all of the data used to mine those insights. They'll need to process instantaneously and with extremely low latency to provide real-time decision making. That will initially appeal to consumer-facing applications like Alexa, where users want immediate responses without waiting for a lag. But if we play this trend forward, we'll soon begin to see more-demanding and higher-dollar applications  . The advantages of FPGAs will find even more opportunities.Xilinx is the pure-play enabler of this trend, and is perfectly poised to capitalize on the adoption of FPGAs into data centers. I believe that Xilinx's stock has a long growth runway, and that forward-thinking investors should consider placing it on their radar. .Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

oday, we decided to focus on a powerful concept: buying stocks at new highs.Some investors don't like to buy stocks reaching new 52-week highs. But if somebody asked you what your best stocks are, it's likely you would name the stocks moving up the most in your portfolio-and vice versa.The most basic idea is that the winners in your portfolio are the ones going up. If a stock is underperforming the market or going down, you'll quickly identify it as one of your worst holdings. With that said, it makes sense that some of these stocks will be reaching new highs along the way.I know many investors are hesitant to buy stocks making new 52-week highs. But there really isn't any reason to be. Some may worry that they have already missed the mark at that point, or that now it has more room to fall. Still, a stock making a new 52-week high is a 'good thing,' just as one falling to a new 52-week low is a 'bad thing.'On top of that, would the person who doesn't want to buy stocks making new highs be upset if a stock they owned broke out to a new 52-week high? Statistics have also shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs. And aren't these the stocks we all dream about?Now obviously, the fundamentals need to be there, and you should try to keep an eye on valuations. But if you were in a stock making new highs and cheering it on, it seems odd to be afraid of one doing the same just because you haven't bought it yet.Think about this: A stock just made a new-52 week high, which is great news. Guess what? Last year it made a new 52-week high as well. And the year before that. And the year before that. Can you imagine all the money you'd be leaving on the table if you were afraid of being in stocks every time they made a new high?Stocks that are either at a new 52-week high, or have just hit it and are still trading within 20% of it, or are climbing towards their 52-week high and are within a 20% striking distance.Even though we're looking for stocks trading near their highs, I want to make sure the price momentum over the last 3 months is positive.The same goes for the last month as well.Only Zacks Strong Buys for this one.As mentioned before, the P/S ratio shows how much you're paying for every $1 of sales the company makes. For this screen, we're requiring the P/S ratio to be less than the median P/S for its Industry. Note: different industries will have different averages or medians for different items. A P/S of 1 is not such a great bargain if the median for its Industry is 0.7. But it's a great find if the Industry's median is 1.5. This parameter lets us focus in on 'discounted' valuations germane to their industry. And this allows these stocks to still be considered undervalued even as their stock price continues higher.Just like the P/S ratio, we're looking for stocks whose P/E is below the median for their respective Industry. Including proven valuation metrics when using price momentum screens gives the trader a significant advantage.While the P/S and P/E ratios searched for stocks with valuations below their Industry's median. This item is looking for stocks with projected growth rates above the median for its Industry. In order for a stock to continue to go higher, there needs to be a reason for it to do so. And strong growth of course is an important part of that.• This helps find stocks where the volume has increased in the recent week vs. the previous week. Once again, if the price is climbing on increased volume, that shows increased demand or buying coming in. And the more buying demand there is for a stock, the more it should climb.• All of the above parameters are applied to stocks with a  and an  shares.The screen is then narrowed down to produce no more than 5 stocks at a time. The way we're doing it with this item is by combining the percentage price change for both the 12-week and 4-week periods to select the top 5 stocks. Why? If the 12=-week % price change is solid, but the 4-week change is relatively weak, that might mean the stock is retreating from its high rather than advancing towards it. On the other hand, if the 12-week gain came largely from just the last 4 weeks-worth of gains; while that's impressive, it shows that the trend prior to the most recent period wasn't as robust. This item tries to find the best gainers on both time horizons in an effort to see that momentum carries forward.Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR)Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)Xilinx, Inc.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Semiconductor ETF Experiences Big Inflow@2019-02-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-etf-experiences-big-inflow-2019-02-15
"fter tumultuous 2018, Wall Street rebounded in January 2019. The stock market has rallied further in February buoyed by positive developments on the United States-China trade war front and temporary deal between the Republicans and Democrats to avert government shutdown again.Moreover, the US economy remains strong as evident from strong manufacturing and labor market data for January. All these catalysts are likely to fuel stock market rally further. Consequently, it will be prudent to invest in stocks which are components of any of the three major stock indexes with a favorable Zacks Rank.On Feb 13, all three major stock indexes - the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite - closed at highest level of 2019 so far. The Dow continued its winning run for two-straight days with a gain of nearly 490 points to close at 25,543.27. Year to date, the blue-chip index is up 9.5%.Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallied for four consecutive days. On Feb 12, the S&P closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since Dec 3, 2018. This was a key technical barrier indicating the benchmark index's upside potential in the near future. Year to date, the broad-market index is up 9.8%.The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at 7,420.38 inching toward breaking its bear market territory at 7,431.50. Year to date, the index is up 11.8%.Trade negotiations between the United States and China entered the third day on Feb 13. Both the countries are hopeful that this fresh round of negotiations would result in an amicable solution to the ongoing tariff war.While such discussions have been termed as only working-level, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are expected in Beijing on Feb 14 for the next level of talks. Investors are also optimistic regarding these negotiations.Meanwhile, on Feb 12, President Donald Trump said that he would consider extending the deadline of the current trade truce period which will come to an end on Mar 1. On Feb 13, South China Morning Pos  ed that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to meet high-level U.S. trade delegation on Feb 15 to resolve this 11 month old tariff related problem.On Feb 12, Republican as well Democrat Congressional leaders reached a joint agreement to allow funding for barriers along the U.S. - Mexico border. This has prevented another government shutdown. The Republicans agreed to far less an amount than initially demanded in a bid to avoid a shutdown. A sum of $1.4 billion was approved by Congress for building 55 miles of new fencing instead of a concrete wall.President Trump had demanded $5.7 billion for the construction of a 215-mile-long concrete border across the border. Speaking from the White House, Trump stated, ""I can't say I'm happy. I can't say I'm thrilled."" Even though the deal has temporarily been approved, it is still pending Trump's agreement. As a matter of fact, Trump has not stated he will reject the proposal. However, on Feb 13, Trump said ""I don't think you're going to see a shutdown."" President's statement significantly bolstered market sentiments.At this stage, it will be lucrative to invest in stocks that are components of any of the three major stock indexes - the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite - with strong growth potential.

"rade concerns resurfaced yesterday and continued to haunt Friday's session, but a late-day rally lifted stocks and kept their weekly winning streaks alive.The NASDAQ rallied enough to finish the day with a gain of 0.14% to 7,298.2, while the S&P managed to advance 0.07% to 2707.88. These indices both spent almost the entire session in the red before that final rush to the upside.The Dow also rallied off a low of nearly 300 points, but couldn't completely recover and finished on the negative side for a third straight session. It had to settle with a dip of only 0.25% (or about 63 points) to 25,106.33.The trade news really rocked the market and threatened to end the bounce that we've enjoyed since Christmas Eve. However, the bulls had a strong third act to end the week. The NASDAQ and Dow improved by nearly 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, extending both of their winning streaks to 7 weeks. The S&P closed higher by about 0.05% for its second straight week in the green.Stocks didn't like hearing that President Trump and President Xi of China wouldn't be meeting before the trade deadline at the beginning of March, which is supposed to signal higher tariffs. And it didn't help that White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said there was still ""a pretty sizable distance"" between the two countries.Nevertheless, trade negotiations pick up again next week as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer make their way to China. And there's always a chance that the upcoming deadline could be extended if progress is being made.Trade is back at the front of the market's mind, so the headlines we get out of those meetings next week will have a big say on whether this winning run stretches to 8 weeks. In the meantime, though, the editors used the market's recent hiccups to make some moves, including buying positions at reduced prices or taking double-digit profits to play it safe. Take a look at their trades below...Counterstrike: This pullback over the last two days gives Jeremy an opportunity to add 5% more to a couple existing positions that were too expensive just a few days ago. Shoe Carnival (SCVL) doesn'  until late next month, but the editor thinks shoes are pretty hot right now and this stock should make up what it lost over the past several weeks. Meanwhile, Jeremy loves e-commerce services company Etsy (ETSY), but its earnings later this month can send the stock sharply in either direction. However, shares are now just too attractive to pass up. Read the complete commentary for a lot more on these moves, including their recommended stop prices. What a busy week for the portfolio! Brian Bolan added three times and today he's selling a couple names for double-digit profits. Shares of Forescout Technologies (FSCT) are soaring today after this security pure play for the IOT space reported strong quarterly results. The editor has talked about taking big profits more frequently in 2019, so he sold FSCT on Friday for a 31.3% return. Programmable microchip maker Xilinx (XLNX) has also been climbing of late, convincing Brian to sell the name and bank a 33.3% profit in a little over 3 months. Given all the market uncertainties at the moment, Tracey is interested in buying more stable mid- and large-cap companies. But there are always exceptions. On Friday, the editor decided to add ZAGG (ZAGG), which is a volatile small cap. However, this maker of invisableSHIELD screen protection for iPhones is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that has all the signs of a classic value stock. Plus, with a PEG under 1.0, it also has the rare combination of value AND growth. Learn a lot more about this new pick in the full write-up. The software security space has been ""red hot"" of late, so Brian Bolan filled one of the portfolio's open spots on Friday with Zix Corp. (ZIXI). The company is a leading provider of hosted email encryption and e-prescribing services. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) preannounced last month and the stock has continued to gain ground. The editor believes ZIXI is on its way to a beat when it reports on the last day of this month. In fact, he thinks the stock will reach double digits before the summer. Moving forward, Brian still wants to get the portfolio up to 15 names, so more buys are likely on the way next week. Shares of Bottomline Technologies (EPAY) plunged recently after its quarterly report failed to impress. Brian Bolan thinks the selloff was a bit overdone. Nevertheless, the editor is all about protecting capital and taking nice gains these days, so he sold EPAY on Friday while he could still get a nice 17.3% return. Look for a replacement next week.Have a Great Weekend,Jim Giaquinto Recommendations from Zacks' Private Portfolios:Believe it or not, this article is not available on the Zacks.com website.

" fourth-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 84 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. On a year-over-year basis, however, the figure decreased 8.7%. Margin pressure on hardware, together with restructuring and transformation charges of $48 million, impacted results.The company's revenues of $1.801 billion topped the consensus estimate of $1.785 billion. The figure increased 1% year over year on a reported basis and 3% on constant currency basis, due to streamlining efforts. Increase in ATM orders positively impacted the top line. Growth in Services segment was also a tailwind.For 2018, revenues fell 2% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings of 84 cents per share fell 18%.Full-year results were affected by headwinds such as hardware delivery related challenges, supply chain issues with the deployment of 80 Series ATMs, production manufacturing ramp up at outsource partners and issues with new distribution center.The company's Software revenues were down 1% year over year on a reported basis to $502 million. The decline was primarily due to a 6% decrease in Software maintenance, 5% decline in Software License and 1% fall in Professional services. The 4% (reported) and 5% (constant currency) year-over-year increase in Cloud was more than offset by the decrease in unit revenues mentioned above.NCR entered the payments space with the acquisition of JetPay, which positively impacted the Cloud revenue growth. The acquisition will also aid its strategy of shifting to more Software and Services lead recurring revenues.Services revenues climbed 2% on a reported basis and 5% on constant currency basis to $633 million. The rise was driven by the company's hardware maintenance and implementation services growth combined with continued momentum in managed service offerings.Hardware revenues grew 2% year over year on a reported basis and 4% on constant currency basis to $666 million. Segment revenues from ATM rose 21% on a reported basis and 26% in constant currency, more than offsetting 16%, 13% and 100% decline in Self-Checkout, POS and IPS, respectively.NCR is also focused on investing in solutions like Emerald software solution, which will help the company transition to a subscription-based model.Non-GAAP gross profit of $495 million was down 5.4% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin contracted 180 basis points to 27.5% due to margin shrinkage in Software and Hardware segments. This was partially offset by margin expansion in the Services segment as a result of improved productivity due to Mission One transformation initiatives.Non-GAAP operating expenses came in at $379 million, reflecting an increase of 23.1% due to restructuring and transformation expenses of $77 million incurred during the quarter.Non-GAAP operating income of $214 million fell 9.3% year over year due to higher employee related expenses and lower Hardware margins.NCR exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $464 million, up from $334 million reported in the previous quarter.The company ended the quarter with $2.98 billion of long-term debt, lower than $2.88 billion reported in the third quarter.Free cash flow of $317 million was impacted by lower year-over-year earnings and higher inventory associated with increased hardware production.The company held back from repurchasing additional share this quarter due to restructuring, lower earnings and higher costs.The company provided outlook for full-year 2019. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $2.75 and $2.85 and revenues are expected to grow 1-2%.Net income is expected to be $290 million to $305 million and adjusted EBITDA is projected within $1.04-$1.08 billion.Cash flow from operations are estimated to be between $705 million and $730 million and free cash flow is likely to be $300-$350 million.NCR continues to focus on its M1 initiatives on services and restructuring activities. Moreover, it has taken up cost saving initiatives, which are expected to result in savings of about $100 million in 2019. | NCR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Xilinx, Inc.  , Twitter, Inc.  and Twilio Inc.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Long-term earnings growth for Xilinx, Twitter and Twilio is projected to be 12%, 11.45% and 9%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ith a strong rebound in the stocks this year, the Nasdaq Composite Index is on the verge of  since 1991. A closing at or above 7,431.50 for the index will mark a sharp rise of 20% from the Dec 24 low and an exit from the bear-market territory.The rally was powered by a solid comeback of the technology sector, which was beaten down badly in fourth quarter last year. A slew of stronger-than-expected earnings results by major technology firms and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade deal renewed investors' sentiment. Additionally, a rebound in oil price as well as Fed's patience approach toward rate hike supported the gains (read:  ).Further, the sector's long-term story remains intact with the emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine. The deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology - the next wireless revolution - is creating further opportunities. The wave of mergers and acquisitions is also providing further impetus to the space.Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which perform typically well in a maturing economic cycle.Further, healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks are also providing a nice boost to Nasdaq. A defensive tilt in uncertain times has raised the appeal of healthcare stocks while a booming economy coupled with higher consumer spending is propelling discretionary stocks higher.As a result,  , which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed 10.9% so far this year.

"Chicago, IL - February 14, 2019 - Stocks in this week's article are  ,  ,  ,  and  .A 52-week high level generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Notably, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

"Chicago, IL -February 21, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .Semiconductor stocks were flying high until last fall, driven by the likes of Nvidia. Since then, shares of many chip stocks have been hammered on the back of worries about a slowing Chinese economy, among other concerns.Last week, Nvidia saw its quarterly revenues sink 24%. Despite the downturn, shares of NVDA popped because the company had warned Wall Street of a major slowdown as it deals with declining demand from cryptocurrency miners, which has also impacted firms like Advanced Micro Devices. Looking ahead, Nvidia appears to be heading for a major slowdown in 2019 in the historically cyclical semiconductor industry.With that said, the industry will remain highly valuable within the larger tech industry as we head toward an even more digitized world. Therefore, now might be a great time to think about buying semiconductor stocks as valuations become more attractive and secular growth trends remain.Today, chips help power everything from video games to data centers. Semiconductor companies are also poised to help drive forward the growth of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and much more.These emerging tech trends have created new consumer demand, and the semiconductor makers are delivering. So, let's take a look at three Zacks buy-ranked semiconductor stocks right now that have performed rather well as of late.Xilinx's Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform is situated to help support the expansion of everything from artificial intelligence and machine vision to databases and data compression. The company's stock price has surged 65% in the last six months and its position in the Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry, which currently ranks #1 out of the 265 industries in our Zacks system, could help this climb continue.Xilinx posted record third-quarter revenue and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 a share. Looking ahead, the company is projected to see its fiscal Q4 revenues surge roughly 23% from the year-ago quarter, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Plus, the company's bottom line is expected to soar nearly 47% and XLNX has earned a ton of positive earnings estimate revisions for Q4 and beyond. Xilinx is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is trading at 31.8X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates to match its industry's average.Inphi is a leader in high-speed data movement interconnects that provides semiconductor components and optical subsystems to networking OEMs, cloud and telecom service providers, and more. Like Xilinx, IPHI stock has surged over 26% in the last six months to outpace its industry's 3% average climb. The Santa Clara, California-based company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that rocks an industry-matching PEG ratio of 1.41.Inphi's adjusted first-quarter earnings are projected to swing from a loss of $0.05 a share in the prior-year quarter to $0.28 per share, which would mark a 660% bottom-line expansion. On top of that, the company is expected to see its quarterly revenues surge by 34.7%. Long-term, Inphi's expected EPS growth rate rests at 18.5%, on an annualized basis.Cree is a manufacturer of LEDs and semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company's ""SmartCast"" platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms. CREE sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has experienced gains of 21.2% in the past three months to top its broader industry's 13% climb.Peeking ahead, analysts expect Cree's current fiscal year earnings, which ends in June, to skyrocket 310%. That growth is expected to continue to the tune of another 63% in the following year. Current estimates also see Cree's revenue growth in these years reaching 10% and 11%, respectively, which means the company might not see the pullback some on Wall Street expect other semiconductors to witness in the near future.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?Who wouldn't? Our annual Top 10s have beaten the market with amazing regularity. In 2018, while the market dropped -5.2%, the portfolio scored well into double-digits overall with individual stocks rising as high as +61.5%. And from 2012-2017, while the market boomed +126.3, Zacks' Top 10s reached an even more sensational +181.9%.Media ContactZacks 800-767-3771 ext. 9339Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

" (NASDAQ: XLNX) is probably one of hottest semiconductor names on the stock market. Shares of the chipmaker have defied the broader market weakness over the past year and as of this writing trade very close to their 52-week highs.Those who have been following Xilinx for a long time wouldn't be surprised at the company's rapid rise, as it was  to boost long-term growth. The company's latest third-quarter results,  , gave it yet another massive boost thanks to the early ramp in the 5G business, as well as continued strength across other segments such as automotive, data centers, and industrial.But with Xilinx stock now trading at a rich trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34, which is nearly double the industry average and the broader S&P 500 index, does it make sense for new investors to jump into the stock based on the 5G excitement? Let's find out.Image Source: Getty Images.Xilinx had always expected that  (5G) wireless networks would be a catalyst, but it probably didn't expect this space to start paying off so soon. Its 5G chip platforms moved from the prototyping phase to the early production phase during the fiscal second quarter. So, the 41% annual jump in its communications business, thanks to early 5G deployments, was a welcome surprise.CEO Victor Peng  ""5G deployments in South Korea and a very early start of the ramp of 5G deployments in China"" for Xilinx's strong performance in the communications business, which supplied 35% of its revenue last quarter. As such, the proliferation of 5G networks in the coming years should be a long-term tailwind for Xilinx, though that might be easier said than done.Xilinx is known for making field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These are programmable chips that aren't made with a specific purpose, so they can be easily configured after being bought off the shelf, which saves on both time and costs. FPGAs work for early stage 5G deployments as carriers need to test the new networks and the related algorithms, and that may require regular tweaks and updates.That's where Xilinx's FPGAs excel, since they can be reprogrammed multiple times, giving developers a low-cost option to test new technology. However, demand for these programmable chips starts waning in a couple of years once the standards are set and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are designed for those tasks.Development of ASICs usually takes around two years and a lot of money, so Xilinx's FPGAs are in strong demand in the early 5G deployment phase. But once a custom chip comes out, the chipmaker could lose market share to rivals because the former are supposed to perform faster and also cost less since they are already programmed for that purpose.Cavium, which was acquired by  in 2018, already showcased its next-generation 5G chips at the Mobile World Congress last year.  , meanwhile, launched its ReefShark 5G chipsets last year in January, claiming that they can reduce the size of 5G antennas considerably and also reduce power consumption of baseband units by 64%.However, the good news is that Xilinx has found ways to beat this inevitability by ingraining itself deeply into the 5G ecosystem.One way to remain in the 5G play is by offering something extra to customers. That's why Xilinx is offering not just chips that help developers develop 5G-specific applications, but also a multiprocessing system-on-a-chip (SoC) that combines radio frequency chips and a processing system that it claims to be an industry-first.According to Xilinx, its integrated 5G chip platform reduces system power consumption and size by 50% to 75% by integrating analog, digital, and embedded software design into one design instead of separate systems. Xilinx  products like these will help it take advantage of 5G deployments for a long time despite the eventual move to ASICs.As such, Xilinx could sustain its 5G momentum for years to come, which could be a big deal for the company as the 5G network infrastructure market is estimated to increase at a annual pace of 118% through 2022, according to IDC.That's probably one of the reasons why Xilinx's earnings are expected to grow at a nice clip over the next two fiscal years and beyond. Analysts expect the company to triple its earnings growth rate for the next half-decade when compared to the last five years, and that could be possible thanks to the 5G tailwind and  Xilinx is sitting on.As such, those who have missed Xilinx's run so far can still consider buying the stock despite its rich valuation because it has the potential to grow at a faster pace in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Will Xilinx's Hot 5G Catalyst Fade Away?@2019-02-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-xilinxs-hot-5g-catalyst-fade-away-2019-02-14
ield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are chips that can be reprogrammed to meet specific needs or perform specific functions after they're manufactured, giving developers the flexibility to alter them per the needs of a task. The  of these chips are giving them solid traction in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and self-driving cars.Not surprisingly, FPGA demand is expected to shoot up in the coming years. Variant Market Research estimates that FPGA sales will exceed $12 billion by 2024, as compared to $6.9 billion a couple of years ago.Investors can take advantage of this opportunity through  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , a pure-play FPGA company, or through  (NASDAQ: INTC) , a chip behemoth with diversified interests, but one of them trumps the other.Image source: Getty Images.FPGAs are a small part of Intel's business empire, producing less than 3% of the company's total revenue. Chipzilla's programmable solutions group (PSG) generated just over $2.1 billion in revenue in 2018, a jump of 11.6% over the prior year. But the downside is that this business won't be moving the needle much for the chipmaker even if it ends up dominating this market in the coming years.Intel has generated nearly $71 billion in revenue over the past year, so even if it doubles its FPGA business in the next couple of years, it would still be getting less than 6% of its revenue from this segment. And that's assuming the company's fast-growing data center and Internet of Things businesses stall.The other problem is that Intel isn't the bigger fish in this space. Xilinx leads in FPGAs with  of the market under its control, while Intel has lost ground and plays second fiddle. In fact, it seems Intel's FPGA growth is slowing down, as revenue from this segment increased just 6% last quarter, while operating profit dropped year over year.A closer look indicates that Intel's programmable solutions business hasn't enjoyed a smooth ride despite the company's massive  nearly four years ago.Data from Intel's quarterly reports. Chart by authorIntel is finding it difficult to gain momentum in FPGAs, as evident from the chart above. Additionally, the company is feeling margin pressure thanks to its  in order to catch up to Xilinx, which enjoys a technology advantage in the FPGA market.And it looks like Xilinx's technology lead is helping it grab more contracts that could eventually boost its FPGA market share, leaving Intel further behind in second place.Xilinx is looking to boost its technology lead over Intel with Project Everest. The chipmaker is looking to improve the functionality of programmable chips with this initiative  a processor, an FPGA, and fast network connectivity into a single system-on-a-chip (SoC) based on the 7-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process.For comparison, Intel's current Stratix FPGAs are built on the 14nm process. Chipzilla's competing 10nm will probably not hit the shelves this year, while Xilinx has  7nm chip. This indicates that Xilinx will continue enjoying a tech lead over Intel. That's because a smaller manufacturing node means that Xilinx is packing more transistors into a more compact chip, which allows it to deliver a stronger performance with low power consumption.So it wouldn't be surprising to see Xilinx increasing its market share by landing more high-profile clients for its FPGA chips. The company has already made some notable progress by scoring contracts with the likes of  and  , who are using Xilinx FPGAs to power their data centers.What's more, it seems  is also prepping to add Xilinx FPGAs to its servers. According to a Bloomberg article, the software giant will reportedly use Xilinx chips to power more than half of its Azure cloud servers. That sounds like a big win for Xilinx, as Microsoft has been known to place FPGA orders with Intel for accelerating AI applications in the cloud.The good part: Such deals are moving the needle in a big way for Xilinx. The company's revenue was up 34% year over year during the recently reported fiscal third quarter, which led to a 42% jump in the company's earnings.Intel is a sum of many parts, while Xilinx is solely focused on the FPGA market. Not surprisingly, the latter is able to use the end-market opportunity to good effect by landing deals with major cloud players and accelerating its financial growth. This makes it a better FPGA bet than Intel, but investors will have to pay a pretty price.Xilinx stock trades at nearly 40 times trailing earnings, though its forward earnings multiple of 26 shows tha  growth is expected. Investors shouldn't be afraid to pay a premium for this chipmaker, especially considering that it dominates a lucrative market that's set to get bigger with time.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

he semiconductor industry had a rough 2018, with most of the major chipset manufacturing stocks closing in the red in last year. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) was down 2.6%. The disappointing performance can be attributed to prolonged trade conflict, chipset supply glut, fear of global demand slowdown and crash of cryptocurrency.However, the semiconductor industry has rebounded in 2019. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) is up 14.5% year to date compared with 8.2% growth of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has witnessed an increase of little over 10%.Most of the semiconductor manufacturers have reported strong earnings result so far. Intel Corp.  , Texas Instruments Inc.  , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  , Lam Research Corp.  and Xilinx Inc.  reported solid fourth quarter earnings results.Chipset industry's downturn in 2018 was the effect of several negative factors. Firstly, the trade-related conflict between the United States and China, which commenced in March 2018 aggravated through the year. China is a major supplier of intermediary products for chipset manufacturing in the United States.Secondly, fear of global economic slowdown, especially the downturn of the Chinese economy, was a major concern. The IMF has reduced global economic growth forecast for 2019 due to trade war concerns. Notably, China also serves as the largest market for several large U.S. semiconductor makers.Thirdly, crash of cryptocurrency industry in 2018 took a heavy toll on the semiconductor industry. Several chipset manufacturers, especially those which manufacture flash memory were optimistic about the growth potential of cryptocurrency. Consequently, chipset supply glut occurred which resulting in price reduction.The semiconductor industry has recovered so far this year buoyed by several positive developments.Firstly, most of the major chipset developers reported solid fourth quarter earnings. For these companies, the earnings beat was mainly because the high-margin analog business remained strong and 5G businesses. Industrial sector and auto were also good. Revenues were strong attributed to 5G deployment by the telecom operators in North America, China and South Korea.Moreover, Texas Instruments' transition from 200mm to 300mm and Xilinx's strong performance of FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS) model for data centers also helped them to post strong results. Likewise Lam Research continued DRAM shifting to lower nodes, NAND shifting to 96-layer devices, which helped the company to lower cost. Skyworks is benefiting from strong demand of its wireless communications engines. The company's expanding product portfolio, growing clout in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions and 5G markets are key catalysts.Secondly, on Feb 6, the Semiconductor Industry Association announced that in 2018, more than a trillion chips shipped globally, for the first time in industry's history. Sales of chips grew 13.7% to $468.8 billion worldwide in 2018 year over year. Consequently, the SOX was up 2.6%.Thirdly, several positive developments took place on trade war front. Notably, the two countries are currently observing a trade truce which will come to end on Mar 1.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Feb 6, that a high level U.S. delegation will visit China to resolve the trade related issues.Price performance of major chipset makers year to date.Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Chicago, IL -February 4, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .There are signs that the semiconductor cycle has peaked driven by softening in smartphone and PC demand. The next wave of growth for semiconductors will come from things like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smart cities, IoT, 5G and auto. Some of the current demand is already aligned with expansion in these markets, but we're just beginning to scratch the surface of that potential.Whether the demand from these markets can offset the cyclical slowdown is an open question and the answer will unfold through this year and the next. In the meantime, the current slate o  shows that there are few safe bets with Xilinx being an outlier.Revenue of $18.657 billion was short of the estimated $19.01 billion. EPS of 1.28 was ahead of the estimated $1.22. By segment: CCG up 9.7% (52.6% revenue share), DCG up 8.7% (32.5%), IOTG down 7.2% (4.4%), NSG up 24.5% (5.9%), PSG up 7.7% (3.3%), other up 27.6% (1.2%).The revenue miss, weaker-than-expected DCG revenue, cautious tone and disappointing guidance were concerns. The lower-than-expected revenue was attributed to weaker orders coming out of China because of a slowing economy. But management also said that macro issues including the trade war with China, the government shutdown and Brexit made them incrementally cautious for the rest of the year although a relative improvement should be expected in the back half when new products including the first 10nm chips are scheduled to ship.CCG wasn't in the spotlight but the business which accounts for more than half of Intel's revenue, benefited from stronger ASPs that more than offset the impact of softer volumes.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are down 4 cents (9.4%) and 4 cents (3.8%), respectively.Texas Instruments topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line while slightly missing on the top line. Management attributed the miss to slowing demand for semiconductors overall (not unexpected given waning demand for smartphones and PCs and ongoing trade tensions with China).The earnings beat was mainly because the high-margin analog business remained strong, helped by 5G deployments at telecom customers. Industrial and auto were also good. Plus the company continues to transition from 200mm to 300mm, which helped it lower cost. An offsetting factor was lower factory utilization to maintain optimal use of cash in the softening demand environment.One of the more popular measures management takes is returning 100% of FCF to shareholders. In 2018, FCF jumped 30% to $6.1 billion and management returned $7.7 billion in share repurchases and dividend.Guidance disappointed, sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate down 10 cents (8.1%) and 9 cents (7.1%) for the March and June quarters, respectively.Xilinx beat the Zacks Consensus on both top and bottom lines helped by double-digit growth across business segments. In Data Center, The FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS) model is gaining momentum with AWS, Huawei and Alibaba. New design wins for its FPGA products included Samsung. In Communications, 5G related spending helped revenue across Korea, China and North America.SoC revenue is benefiting from the Zync platform that offers ARM technology (software programmability), Xilinx FPGA (hardware programmability) and I/O programmability. Strength in Advanced Products came from 28nm and 20nm categories. What's more, it also guided better than expected. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are up 12 cents (14.6%) and 8 cents (9.6), respectively.The reasons for particular optimism around Xilinx that will continue in quarters ahead are first, with Intel snapping up Altera, the only other major FPGA player, all rivals feel affinity to Xilinx; second, the company has a solid strategy based on some compelling products that will drive continued expansion in its revenue and profits, even in a difficult market such as this.The recently announced 7nm Versal, for instance, is the first product in its adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP), which is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform enabling hardware-level flexibility suitable for machine learning, big data applications, cloud computing and more.On the discrete level, its recently-launched Alveo enables acceleration in industry standard servers. Throw in the Zync platform and wrap it up with the FaaS model, and it's clear that this company is going places.Lam's reported revenue and earnings of $2.52 billion (in-line with the Zacks Consensus) and adjusted earnings of $3.87 (beat by 5.5%) are illustrative of a slowing semiconductor cycle. New CEO Tim Archer's commentary supports the view: ""While near-term market trends reflect adjustments after a period of tremendous growth in semiconductor demand, I am confident that our focus on Deposition and Etch technology leadership as well as growth in our installed-base business positions us well for the long term.""Memory, which accounts for more than half its revenue, will be meaningfully lower this year, as Chinese spending tapers off after a period of strong builds. The memory business will be driven by the need to lower cost: DRAM shifting to lower nodes, NAND shifting to 96-layer devices. Foundry and logic, weighted to the first half, will be stronger.The Board of Directors approved a $5 billion share repurchase program, and given its low valuation both with respect to the S&P 500 and peer group, this might be a good time to buy back some shares.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for March and June quarters are down 21 cents (6.2%) and 65 cents (16.5%), respectively.This European maker of advanced lighting systems used in the semiconductor manufacturing process beat on both the top and bottom lines. The good news is that demand out of China remains strong according to management. The bad news is that some customers pushed back orders from the first half into the second because of end market softness. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the March and June quarters are down $1.47 (73.1%) and $1.00 (49.0%), respectively.While management expressed confidence in its growth in 2020 and said that 2019 would also be a growth year albeit backend loaded, order pushouts due to end market softness is never a good thing. There could be more pushouts, who knows? That said, the company has some pretty big customers in Intel, Samsung, TSMC and the like; management said that the first DRAM customers would be using its systems this year; and China is very unlikely to ramp down its semiconductor capacity builds.

"here are signs that the semiconductor cycle has peaked driven by softening in smartphone and PC demand. The next wave of growth for semiconductors will come from things like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smart cities, IoT, 5G and auto. Some of the current demand is already aligned with expansion in these markets, but we're just beginning to scratch the surface of that potential.Whether the demand from these markets can offset the cyclical slowdown is an open question and the answer will unfold through this year and the next. In the meantime, the current slate o  shows that there are few safe bets with Xilinx being an outlier.Revenue of $18.657 billion was short of the estimated $19.01 billion. EPS of 1.28 was ahead of the estimated $1.22. By segment: CCG up 9.7% (52.6% revenue share), DCG up 8.7% (32.5%), IOTG down 7.2% (4.4%), NSG up 24.5% (5.9%), PSG up 7.7% (3.3%), other up 27.6% (1.2%).The revenue miss, weaker-than-expected DCG revenue, cautious tone and disappointing guidance were concerns. The lower-than-expected revenue was attributed to weaker orders coming out of China because of a slowing economy. But management also said that macro issues including the trade war with China, the government shutdown and Brexit made them incrementally cautious for the rest of the year although a relative improvement should be expected in the back half when new products including the first 10nm chips are scheduled to ship.CCG wasn't in the spotlight but the business which accounts for more than half of Intel's revenue, benefited from stronger ASPs that more than offset the impact of softer volumes.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are down 4 cents (9.4%) and 4 cents (3.8%), respectively.Texas Instruments topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line while slightly missing on the top line. Management attributed the miss to slowing demand for semiconductors overall (not unexpected given waning demand for smartphones and PCs and ongoing trade tensions with China).The earnings beat was mainly because the high-margin analog business remained strong, helped by 5G deployments at telecom customers. Industrial and auto were also good. Plus the company continues to transition from 200mm to 300mm, which helped it lower cost. An offsetting factor was lower factory utilization to maintain optimal use of cash in the softening demand environment.One of the more popular measures management takes is returning 100% of FCF to shareholders. In 2018, FCF jumped 30% to $6.1 billion and management returned $7.7 billion in share repurchases and dividend.Guidance disappointed, sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate down 10 cents (8.1%) and 9 cents (7.1%) for the March and June quarters, respectively.Xilinx beat the Zacks Consensus on both top and bottom lines helped by double-digit growth across business segments. In Data Center, The FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS) model is gaining momentum with AWS, Huawei and Alibaba. New design wins for its FPGA products included Samsung. In Communications, 5G related spending helped revenue across Korea, China and North America.SoC revenue is benefiting from the Zync platform that offers ARM technology (software programmability), Xilinx FPGA (hardware programmability) and I/O programmability. Strength in Advanced Products came from 28nm and 20nm categories. What's more, it also guided better than expected. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the March and June quarters are up 12 cents (14.6%) and 8 cents (9.6), respectively.The reasons for particular optimism around Xilinx that will continue in quarters ahead are first, with Intel snapping up Altera, the only other major FPGA player, all rivals feel affinity to Xilinx; second, the company has a solid strategy based on some compelling products that will drive continued expansion in its revenue and profits, even in a difficult market such as this.The recently announced 7nm Versal, for instance, is the first product in its adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP), which is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform enabling hardware-level flexibility suitable for machine learning, big data applications, cloud computing and more.On the discrete level, its recently-launched Alveo enables acceleration in industry standard servers. Throw in the Zync platform and wrap it up with the FaaS model, and it's clear that this company is going places.Lam's reported revenue and earnings of $2.52 billion (in-line with the Zacks Consensus) and adjusted earnings of $3.87 (beat by 5.5%) are illustrative of a slowing semiconductor cycle. New CEO Tim Archer's commentary supports the view: ""While near-term market trends reflect adjustments after a period of tremendous growth in semiconductor demand, I am confident that our focus on Deposition and Etch technology leadership as well as growth in our installed-base business positions us well for the long term.""Memory, which accounts for more than half its revenue, will be meaningfully lower this year, as Chinese spending tapers off after a period of strong builds. The memory business will be driven by the need to lower cost: DRAM shifting to lower nodes, NAND shifting to 96-layer devices. Foundry and logic, weighted to the first half, will be stronger.The Board of Directors approved a $5 billion share repurchase program, and given its low valuation both with respect to the S&P 500 and peer group, this might be a good time to buy back some shares.Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimates for March and June quarters are down 21 cents (6.2%) and 65 cents (16.5%), respectively.This European maker of advanced lighting systems used in the semiconductor manufacturing process beat on both the top and bottom lines. The good news is that demand out of China remains strong according to management. The bad news is that some customers pushed back orders from the first half into the second because of end market softness. Result: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the March and June quarters are down $1.47 (73.1%) and $1.00 (49.0%), respectively.While management expressed confidence in its growth in 2020 and said that 2019 would also be a growth year albeit backend loaded, order pushouts due to end market softness is never a good thing. There could be more pushouts, who knows? That said, the company has some pretty big customers in Intel, Samsung, TSMC and the like; management said that the first DRAM customers would be using its systems this year; and China is very unlikely to ramp down its semiconductor capacity builds. So let's see how the year shapes up.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

"Chicago, IL - February 4, 2018 -  Xilinx, Inc.  as the Bull of the Day, Signet Jewelers Ltd.  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet Inc.  , The Walt Disney Company  and Twitter, Inc.  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: :Based in San Jose, CA,  is a semiconductor company that designs and develops programmable devices and associated technologies for cloud and wireless communications applications. Xilinx is known for inventing the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device, and it also created the first fabless manufacturing model.Xilinx reported third-quarter results that beat analyst expectations and shares popped 18% as a result.Earnings of 92 cents came in well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents per share.Revenues surged 34% year-over-year to $800 million, also beating our consensus estimate thanks to strength across the company's Wireless Communications, Aerospace and Defense, and Test and Emulation markets.In particular, Xilinx's Wireless segment is benefitting from early 5G production, pre-5G deployments and LTE upgrades.Advanced product revenues jumped 51% year-over-year, contributing 66% to total revenues.Xilinx also saw year-over-year growth across all four regions: North America and Europe grew 24% each while Asia Pacific and Japan grew 47% and 26%, respectively.President and CEO Victor Peng said in the earnings release that ""Based on the guidance we are providing for the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect to exceed $3 billion in annual revenues for the first time in our history…We continue to execute to our strategy and drive growth across our portfolio."" : is the world's largest diamond jewelry retailer, and operates under the brand names Kay Jewelers, Zales, and Jared The Galleria of Jewelry, among others. The company has over 3,500 stores primarily in the U.S., the U.K., Ireland, and the Channel Islands.In the past six months, shares of Signet have fallen nearly 60%. Disappointing holiday sales and a cut to its Q4 and fiscal 2019 guidance hurt the stock, especially after a brutal 40% decline in December, and investors have dumped their positions.Last December saw the company report mixed results. Signe  ed an adjusted loss of $1.06 per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.08. Revenues also beat our consensus estimate and same-store sales rose 1.6% year-over-year.But, the big year-over-year bottom line decline coupled with lowered full-year guidance left the market and investors underwhelmed.On top of this report came weaker-than-expected holiday sales a few weeks ago. Total sales for the nine-week period fell 2.5% and same-store sales decreased 1.3%; sales in its North America and International segments fell as well, down 2.1% and 11.7%, respectively.As a result, guidance for the current year and quarter was trimmed even more.Signet now expects same-store sales to be flat compared to previous guidance of flat to up 1%. Adjusted earnings are projected to fall in the range of $3.53-$3.69 per share compared to $4.15-$4.40 per share. Total sales will now be between $6.24 billion to $6.26 billion compared to $6.26 billion to $6.31 billion.CEO Virginia Drosos commented ""…the competitive promotional environment we saw early in the season intensified in December and, despite our increased promotional investments, we experienced reduced traffic during key December gifting weeks. Combined with higher than expected credit costs, these factors negatively impacted our profitability.""It was another good week for stocks, as Wall Street celebrated trade talks and a newly dovish Fed by sending indexes higher once again. The positive trading was also delivered amid a packed stretch of Q4 earnings reports, which largely impressed.So far this earnings season, companies have broadly surpassed expectations, as estimates that moved lower during late 2018's uncertainty proved easier to beat. This trend is evidenced by the likes of Apple, which outperformed estimates that were lowered after its rare profit warning, and Facebook, a company that many expected to underperform amid rising expenses.But whether or not this earnings momentum will continue remains to be seen. There are plenty of bellwether companies yet to report, and the true impact o  season is often not realized until several weeks after the fact.In this important period, investors should remember to use the  to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we're going to take a look at a few of the upcoming week's most important reports. This is an incomplete list, no doubt. The companies below, in our view, simply carry the heaviest narratives into their reports, and they should serve as great indicators for their broader industries.Check out our top earnings reports to watch for the week of February 4:Google parent Alphabet will report  on Monday. Shares of the internet pioneer are up about 7% in the past month, and its consensus earnings estimate has gained over the last 60 days. However, the most recent analyst estimates have been lower, raising questions about Google's latest profit trends.Analysts expect Alphabet to repor  of $11.08 per share and adjusted revenue of $31.3 billion, according to our Zacks Consensus Estimates. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 14% and 21%, respectively. Alphabet's Most Accurate Estimate-a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate-sits two pennies below the consensus. Recent estimates are typically more reliable than older estimates. Still, GOOGL has missed our consensus just twice in the trailing eight quarters.Media and entertainment behemoth Disney is scheduled to report after the closing bell on Tuesday. Disney shares have added just over 2% in the past month. Earnings estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have fallen. Analysts have also revised their full-year EPS estimates for Disney to the downside recently.Our latest Zacks Consensus figures are now calling for Disney to pos  of $1.57 per share and revenue of $15.2 billion. These figures would mark year-over-year declines of 17% and 1%, respectively. Guidance will be important as Disney approaches the release of its over-the-top streaming service. Right now, earnings are expected to be down 1% on revenue growth of 2% for the fiscal year ending in September.Social media giant Twitter is scheduled to announce its latest quarterly results before the market opens on February 7. Twitters shares are up about 17% in the last month. Earnings estimates have ticked lower recently, although the consensus is now back to where it was as recently as 90 days ago.The most updated consensus estimates for Twitter's report sit at $0.25 in earnings per share and revenue of $871.6 million. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 32% and 19%, respectively.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

" 52-week high generally serves as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Notably, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms o  as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.The lower, the better.This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decen  growth adds to investor optimism.No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market.

acks Rank #1 stocks outperform the market in good and bad times. With that said, there are over 200 stocks that hold a Zacks Rank #1 at any given time. Therefore, it is extremely helpful to understand how to apply filters to the Zacks Rank in order to narrow the list down to a more manageable and tradable set of stocks.Today we are going to show investors how to add two relatively simple filters to our Zacks Rank #1 criteria that narrows down the number of stocks and often increases its performance as well.Clearly, there are only three items on this screen. But together, these three filters can result in some impressive returns.• Starting with a Zacks Rank #1 is often a strong jumping off point because it boasts an average annual return of over 25% per year over the last 30 years.• Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.The Zacks Rank looks a  estimate revisions for the current year (F1) and the next year (F2). The additional component factors in current quarter (Q1) estimate revisions. The idea is pretty simple.A company that has experienced downward revisions for the current quarter could soon see longer-term negative revisions. Meanwhile, if a company has earned positive earnings revisions for its current quarter, it might signal that more upward revisions could be coming down the road, which would make it an attractive buy.• Top 5 stocks with the best average broker rating changes over the last four weeks.In this screen, we are searching for positive broker rating changes or upgrades over the last four weeks. On top of that, we want to cut down on the number of stocks that come through. So, we configured the screen to select the top 5 stocks with the best broker rating upgrade.Investors should note that broker ratings typically lean toward the upside. Therefore, our screen makes sure that the brokers are getting more bullish, or at the least not getting less bullish (or even bearish) on the stock.It is worth noting that the actual broker ratings do not matter as much as the upgrade itself, because stocks with broker rating upgrades have been proven to outperform their counterparts that do not earn positive broker rating changes or downgrades.Alone, these two items added to the Zacks #1 Rank produce impressive and powerful results!So, for a great and reliable way to trade some of the best Zacks #1 Ranked stocks, try the Filtered Zacks Rank 5 strategy and trade fewer stocks for even bigger returns.Xilinx, Inc.

"Chicago, IL -January 28, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including PayPal (PYPL), Honeywell (HON) and Kraft Heinz (KHC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet Software industry in the past year (+7.9% vs. +4.3%). The Zacks analyst thinks PayPal's portfolio strength remains its key growth driver. Venmo's improving monetization efforts and its increasing adoption rate across various platforms are aiding the company's user base.A rising number of merchants using One Touch and growing availability of Choice are major positives. However, intensifying competition from major players in the finance and payment industry poses a risk to the company's market position.PayPal continues to suffer from foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rate risks. Further, the antitrust issues in the U.K. regarding the company's acquisition of iZettle remain major concerns. Additionally, sale of the company's U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony is expected to continue impacting its top-line growth.(You can  ).Shares of  have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the past six months, losing -11.3% vs. a -14% decline. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2018 results. The company's top-line performance improved 6%, year over year, organically.Honeywell believes sturdier demand for its innovative technology solutions will continue to drive the company's segmental revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks analyst thinks stronger sales volumes, increased productivity and ongoing commercial effectiveness actions will like drive near-term profitability.The company is currently facing inflationary headwinds across its entire supply-chain process. Inflation in logistics, transportation and in certain material prices might continue to weigh over Honeywell's profitability in the upcoming quarters.(You can  ). 's shares have declined -14.9% over the past three months, underperforming the Zacks Diversified Food industry which is down -7.1% over the same period. The Zacks analyst thinks Kraft Heinz has been benefitting from improved volume/mix in almost all segments and consumption growth in the United States.The company has solid innovation initiatives planned in the foodservice space to fuel growth across all regions. It is also making innovation efforts in its growing e-commerce channel. Its well-designed saving and productivity efforts are other positives. This is mainly attributable to continued softness in the Canada region, stemming from product discontinuations and higher promotional expenses.Sales in this region have been falling year over year for three straight quarters now. Moreover, escalating overhead and input costs has been a deterrent to the company's performance. In fact, such costs more than offset growth in organic sales while also impacting overall profitability in the third quarter.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Canadian Pacific (CP) and Xilinx (XLNX).Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Media ContactZacks 800-767-3771 ext. 9339Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

"or many tech investors, dividends are almost an afterthought. If you're out looking for the next big thing that'll multiply your money, getting paid a few percentage points of your investment each year might not be the most appealing prospect.However, if you want to invest in more established tech companies for the long haul and would like to get paid a dividend while you wait for those shares to appreciate, you may want to take a look at these three stocks.Image source: Getty Images.One of the world's biggest and most successful video game publishers is  (NASDAQ: ATVI) . The company owns many valuable franchises, including  ,  , and, by way of its acquisition of King.com in February 2016,  .The company's stock has tumbled since the company posted worse-than-expected earnings results in November. However, Fool.com colleague John Ballard recently highlighted a number of compelling  for the video game publisher, such as the company's work to grab a slice of China's $15 billion mobile video game opportunity, as well as its increasingly crafty ways to monetize games. John therefore argues that Activision Blizzard's stock decline ""could represent a tangible buying opportunity.""I agree, and as a bonus, the company offers investors a modes  of 0.71% while they wait for a rebound. It's also worth noting that while the company hasn't had a dividend for long, having paid its first annual dividend in 2010, it has consistently raised its dividend each year. data by One chip stock that's been on fire lately is  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , which makes chips known as field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs.

These design wins, Peng said, ""will drive revenue growth in more of the mid- to long term.""In addition to seeing a solid and growing dividend, analysts expect the company to deliver 17.2% revenue growth in 2019 and 8.7% growth in 2020. That growth, should it materialize, may help fuel not only the company's profits but also potentially its stock price and continued dividend growth.

"hares of  (NASDAQ: XLNX) surged 18% on Jan. 24 after the chipmaker's third quarter earnings beat analysts' estimates. Its revenue rose 34% annually to $800 million, beating expectations by $30 million. Its non-GAAP net income rose 42% to $237 million, or $0.92 per share, which topped estimates by seven cents. On a sequential basis, Xilinx's revenue and net income both rose 7%.Xilinx expects to generate $815-$835 million in revenues in the fourth quarter, which represents 21%-24% annual growth and 2%-4% sequential growth. That's much higher than the consensus forecast of $776 million, and indicates that Xilinx is bucking the slowdown across the semiconductor market.Image source: Getty Images.Analysts expect Xilinx's revenue to rise 20% for the full year, but that forecast will likely be revised to reflect Xilinx's rosier guidance. Xilinx didn't provide any earnings guidance, but analysts expect its earnings to rise 31% annually for the fourth quarter and 63% for the full year.Analysts expect Xilinx's revenue and earnings to rise 7% and 9%, respectively, next year. However, Xilinx didn't provide any forecasts for fiscal 2020, and said that it would offer clearer estimates during its Investor and Analyst Day on May 14. Let's dig deeper into Xilinx's third quarter numbers to see if investors should chase this post-earnings pop.Xilinx mainly sells FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), a class of programmable chips that can be customized for a wide range of industries. Xilinx invented FPGAs three decades ago, maintained that first-mover's advantage, and consistently held a larger market share than its closest rival, Altera -- which  (NASDAQ: INTC) acquired in 2015.Xilinx also remains ahead of Intel on the tech curve. Its latest FPGAs are 7-nanometer chips, while Intel is still making a  from 14-nm to 10-nm chips. That's why Altera, now known as Intel's PSG (Programmable Solutions Group), grew its revenues by just 8% annually last quarter.Xilinx generates its revenue from five main markets: Data Center and TME (Test, Measurement, and Emulation) customers; Auto, Broadcast, and Consumer customers; Communications customers; and Industrial, Aerospace, and Defense customers. Here's how those four businesses fared during the third quarter:
  
Source: Xilinx Q3 report.Xilinx attributed the strong growth of its Communication division to the production of 5G hardware, pre-5G deployments, and LTE upgrades, especially in South Korea and China. Its Aerospace and Defense revenues were bolstered by ""broad strength"" across multiple defense programs.Xilinx admitted that plummeting demand for cryptocurrency mining solutions dented its data center growth, but that the unit's ""core"" revenues (excluding crypto) ""nearly doubled"" year-over-year. Demand for its automotive chips was also buoyed by higher sales of ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) and autonomous driving solutions.Image source: Getty Images.Looking ahead, Xilinx expects  for AI and machine learning solutions to bolster demand for its FPGAs in the data center and automotive markets. That's why it acquired Chinese machine learning start-up DeePhi Tech last year.Xilinx expects its fourth quarter growth to be driven by the strength of the Communications and Data Center/TME markets again, which should only be partly offset by declines in its Automotive, Broadcast, and Consumer markets.Xilinx's top line growth looks healthy, but its margins are declining. I  ed a gross margin of 69% during the third quarter, roughly unchanged from the second quarter but a 130 basis point drop from a year earlier. That decline is expected to continue, with its gross margin dropping to 68.5% in the fourth quarter. Additional pressures from tariff impacts, which Xilinx calls ""speculative"" at this point, could exacerbate the decline.On the bright side, Xilinx's non-GAAP operating margin of 32.9% marked a 130 basis point improvement from the second quarter and a 590 basis point gain from a year earlier. Xilinx expects its operating expenses to rise less than 4% sequentially during the fourth quarter.Xilinx's well-diversified business model, which places irons in the fire across many promising industries, makes it a safer play than chipmakers that are concentrated in a smaller number of markets (like PCs and phones) or large customers. However, the stock also trades at over 30 times next year's earnings, indicating that a lot of that optimism is already baked in. I still like Xilinx as a long-term investment, but I think investors should wait for a pullback instead of chasing this post-earnings rally.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of SOXX, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SOXX's low point in its 52 week range is $144.79 per share, with $198.84 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $171.92. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@SOXX, XLNX, ADI, TSM: ETF Outflow Alert@2019-01-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/soxx-xlnx-adi-tsm-etf-outflow-alert-2019-01-25

"nder previous CEO Brian Krzanich,  (NASDAQ: INTC) was fairly acquisitive. The company spent a whopping $16.7 billion on programmable-chip specialist Altera and another $15.3 billion for self-driving-car chip specialist Mobileye during his tenure.These two acquisitions were supposed to expand the chip giant's total addressable market (TAM), and they did. But I'd argue that simply getting more aggressive in leveraging its core technologies in new markets translated into more TAM expansion than these acquisitions did.Image source: Intel.First, let's look at how the Altera acquisition expanded Intel's TAM. In the world of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), there are two major players -- Intel's programmable solutions group (PSG), which is what Altera is now known by, and rival  (NASDAQ: XLNX) . In 2018, PSG generated $2.12 billion in revenue and $466 million in operating income. During its past four quarters, Xilinx raked in a little over $2.9 billion. That means the TAM Intel is going after was worth a little over $5 billion over the past year, and it looks set to grow.When Intel acquired Altera, it sold investors on the notion that having Altera's technology in-house could help boost its data center group business by allowing it to build processors with integrated FPGAs. The company reportedly shipped a specialized Xeon data-center part that combined a Xeon processor with an FPGA on the same package, but the company has been mum about further levels of integration.It's harder to get a clear picture of the TAM that Mobileye opens up for Intel. In its acquisition announcement, Intel said that ""we estimate autonomous driving could be up to a $70B TAM by 2030, when you factor in vehicle systems, data, and services.""Realistically, though, that number is inflated. In the acquisition announcement, Intel noted that Mobileye consensus revenue estimates for 2020 were less than $2 billion against a projected ""vehicles systems and services"" TAM of a little over $20 billion.It seems the addition of Mobileye to Intel's portfolio may have expanded the company's nearer-term TAM by, at most, a few billion dollars. The company's longer-term projections, the ones that talk about the 2030 time-frame, don't mean much to me because it's almost impossible to make reliable predictions that far out.Let's consider some of the ways Intel is growing its TAM organically. The company signaled its intention in late 2017 to enter the market for standalone graphics processing units (GPUs), targeting both PC gaming and the data center. While those efforts will require incremental investments, the company is fundamentally expanding on graphics technology it already builds, rather than acquiring its way into a new market.For perspective, graphics specialist  (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which commands the lion's share of the standalone GPU market, generated $8.14 billion from sales of standalone GPUs during its fiscal 2018 and nearly $8.2 billion in GPU sales through the first three quarters of its fiscal 2019. Although that figure was inflated by sales of GPUs to cryptocurrency miners, and that  , the point is that the standalone GPU TAM is a large one that Intel is, through organic means, going after.That's not all, though, as Intel has also doubled down on its efforts to build memory products based on both 3D NAND and 3D XPoint technology. The memory market is in pretty rough shape right now, with Intel's non-volatile memory solutions group (NSG) falling short of expectations last quarter because of a ""weaker NAND pricing environment"" and suffering a $5 million operating loss in 2018, but the TAM the company is going after here is still significant. Intel didn't need to buy its way into the memory market, either.On a related note, Intel is also leveraging the 3D XPoint memory technology NSG developed to build dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) substitutes, known as  , in a bid to try to capture some of the DRAM TAM while simultaneously building a moat around its Xeon data center processor platforms. That means if customers want the benefits of Optane DC Persistent Memory, they need to use Intel's latest Xeon processors.I don't want to suggest that Intel not acquire technologies and businesses to help it grow. It's just that Intel spent $32 billion to get its hands on two companies that haven't exactly been game-changers so far. Perhaps those acquisitions will prove more valuable over time, but I can't help thinking the company spent a lot of money for a pretty modest TAM expansion.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"omentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Xilinx currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for XLNX that show why this computer chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For XLNX, shares are up 2.86% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry is up 2.86% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 25.81% compares favorably with the industry's 25.81% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Xilinx have increased 21.92% over the past quarter, and have gained 52.08% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -0.09% and -5.1%, respectively.Investors should also take note of XLNX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, XLNX is averaging 3,178,299 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with XLNX.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost XLNX's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.29 to $3.41 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that XLNX is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Xilinx on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It is also making innovation efforts in its growing e-commerce channel. Its well-designed saving and productivity efforts are other positives. This is mainly attributable to continued softness in the Canada region, stemming from product discontinuations and higher promotional expenses.Sales in this region have been falling year over year for three straight quarters now. Moreover, escalating overhead and input costs has been a deterrent to the company's performance. In fact, such costs more than offset growth in organic sales while also impacting overall profitability in the third quarter.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include  (AMTD), Canadian Pacific (CP) and Xilinx (XLNX).Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: XLNX)Q3 2019 Jan. 23, 2019 , Good afternoon. My name is Louise, and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you, Mr. Poirier, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, Louise, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and the business outlook for the March quarter.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.In addition to GAAP financial measures, we will be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions.We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. And it can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very excited to report that executing on our strategy has continued to deliver excellent results in FY 2019, with substantial and broad strength in our business in Q3. Revenue was $800 million, up 34% year-on-year, driving non-GAAP operating income up over 60% year-on-year, and non-GAAP EPS up over 40% year-on-year to $0.92 per share.We had growth in each of our primary end markets led by strength in the Wireless Communications, Aerospace and Defense, Test Measurement and Emulation markets. We expect to surpass a record $3 billion of revenue for fiscal 2019 with the Q4 guidance that Lorenzo will cover in his remarks.Now let me share some Q3 highlights. Communication was very strong in the third quarter, driven by the Wireless market where we are seeing growth from the very early production 5G and pre-5G deployments, as well as some LTE upgrades. The strong growth was primarily driven by 5G deployments in South Korea and a very early start of the ramp of 5G deployments in China.Aerospace and Defense revenue was also sharply increased as we expected in the third quarter, driven by broad strength across multiple defense and stage programs. Test Measurement and Emulation revenue was also strong across both the test and measurement, as well as the emulation and prototyping subsegments.If you look at our core Data Center revenue and what I mean by core is not including cryptocurrency, that grew double-digit -- double digits within the quarter and on a year-on-year basis nearly doubled. However, cryptocurrency was off, so there was some offset from that perspective.Now that said, we continue to build a very strong momentum with hyperscalers, where we are expanding our ecosystem for a broad adoption of our products and applications across the compute, storage and networking segments. We had design wins and applications including big data analytics acceleration, machine learning inference, video transcoding, network acceleration, as well as in storage controllers.We have now won designs for SmartNIC applications with multiple hyperscalers and in the FPGA as a service area, we have additional engagements beyond our previously announced deployments with Amazon, Alibaba and Huawei. We also expanded our Alveo board family that we had just launched this past October at our developers forum. We recently added the Alveo U280 product for the previously announced U200 and U250.U280 has a large capacity Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA together with high bandwidth memory. These are the 3D memory specs for the ultimate in high performance acceleration of applications such as big data analytics, as well as data mining. In addition, Dell EMC has certified and is now selling the Alveo U200 as an add-on accelerator card for multiple versions of their PowerEdge servers.With respect to our transformation to a platform company, our 28-nanometer and 16-nanometer Zynq SoC products continue to grow very robustly. Zynq sales grew approximately 80% year-on-year led by our 16-nanometer MPSoC products and there was a strength that we saw across a very broad set of applications and communications, automotive, particularly ADAS, as well as industrial end markets. Zynq MPSoC revenues grew over 3x from the year ago quarter.And there are SoC design win momentum also continues to grow. We are now engaged with over 300 unique customers in multiple end markets, which is more than triple the number we had just in the last quarter. We are also seeing increased activity in design wins of our MPSoC and autonomous driving and other forms of automotive applications. These revenues, excuse me, these wins will drive revenue growth in more of the mid- to long-term.So just recently Daimler unveiled at CES their MBUX Interior Assistant in the Mercedes-Benz GLE model and this is powered by one of our MPSoCs that is running a number of image recognitions running multiple neural networks. ZF has also announced a strategic cooperation with us at CES, where again our technology will power ZF's very advanced AI based automotive control unit for autonomous vehicles.And finally, I'm really pleased to report that we taped out our first 7-nanometer Versal product, the industry's first ACAP just as we planned. As you may recall, ACAP is a new product category and that stands for Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform. ACAPs are adaptable, very scalable, they are heterogeneous compute platforms that are both hardware, as well as software programmable and are far more powerful than FPGAs. So we will be sampling our 7-nanometer Versal products to customers in the second half of this calendar year.I'm extremely proud of our team for their execution both on the business results, as well as on the major engineering programs, as we head into the fourth quarter of what's been a truly exceptional fiscal year.So thank you and let me turn it over to Lorenzo now. -- Yeah. Thank you, Victor. As Victor said, we are very pleased that our focus and execution are delivering outstanding results. Xilinx achieved a significant milestone this quarter attaining $800 million in revenue for the first time. We exceeded our guidance growing 7% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. This performance is again due to the strength of our Advanced Products, which grew 9% sequentially and 51% year-over-year.All four of our primary end markets showed growth in the quarter. Data Center and TME grew, was strengthened both businesses, as Victor said, excluding a decline in cryptocurrency. Communications increased as significant growth in wireless easily offset an expected decline in wired. Industrial and A&D also grew significantly, as A&D increased more than expected and Industrial was slightly weaker than expected.Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer increased, driven by growth in Broadcast, offsetting an expected decline in Consumer, while the Auto business was flat. Channel revenue was approximately $14 million in line with the expectations.Gross margin was 69% in line with guidance. Operating expense with GAAP OpEx at $294 million and non-GAAP at $289 million was in line with our guidance. And with revenue higher than expected, and gross margin and operating expense in line with expectations, our operating income was higher than expected. GAAP operating income was $258 million or 32.2% and non-GAAP operating income was $263 million or 32.9%.Our GAAP tax rate was 7% for the quarter and the non-GAAP rate was 10%. The primary difference from our guidance and between the GAAP and non-GAAP rate is related to tax reform. Earnings again set a record for the company. GAAP net income was $239 million, which yielded diluted earnings per share of $0.93. Non-GAAP net income was $237 million, which yielded non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92. Share count increased slightly to just over 256 million shares.The key points on the balance sheet and cash flow. Gross cash was up to $3.5 billion with $1.7 billion in net debt. Note that in fiscal Q4, we have $500 million of debt instrument coming due. Accounts receivable declined to $359 million and is at 41 days. Inventory increased $40 million to $283 million, as we built inventory to support future demand, particularly in Wireless Communication.In sum, we generated $314 million in operating cash flow. This quarter, we returned $92 million to shareholders, almost entirely by dividend. We repurchased $1 million worth of shares this quarter, bringing our total for the year to $162 million, 2.4 million shares at an average price of $66.30. We continue to apply our capital allocation strategy as discussed at our Analyst Day.Now on to guidance for the final quarter of fiscal year 2019. We expect continued revenue growth with sales to be between $815 million and $835 million. With regards to primary end markets, we are forecasting growth in Communications and Data Center and TME, particular strength will be in Wireless and TME. After a very strong December quarter, we are expecting Industrial and A&D to decline. We are also expecting a decline across Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer.Channel revenue is expected to be between $0 million and $10 million. Our inventory management processes have taken us close to target levels of inventory, given distributor revenue levels. Gross margin is expected to be 68.5%. GAAP operating expense is expected to grow to $310 million, driven by increased mask and wafer expense and employee compensation. Non-GAAP operating expense will be approximately $305 million. GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $4 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 6% and 8%, and we expect share count to slightly increase.As I close, I want to highlight our financial performance for the fiscal year-to-date as this longer view clearly demonstrates the consistent strength of our business. Revenue is up 22% compared to the first three quarters of last year. All four of our reported end markets show double-digit growth. Advanced Products are up approximately 40%.Our revenue growth has allowed us to continue to invest in our business while delivering outstanding profitability. Operating income dollars are up greater than 35%. GAAP net income and EPS have more than doubled and non-GAAP net income and EPS are up 30%. Finally, operating cash flow exceeded $800 million, an increase of nearly 40% over the first three quarters of fiscal year 2018.Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. It's good to see at least one semiconductor company outperforming. So, Victor, I'm curious, as you are starting to get into these 5G deployments, what is the range of content you are seeing in these deployments and how would you contrast it with 4G? And as part of that, how do you address some investor concern about when there could be competition from ASICs or merchant silicon, right, which we saw back in the 3G and 4G days? Thank you. -- So I think in earlier calls, we've talked about how we are in virtually all the pre-5G proof-of-concepts and demonstrations, not only in the radio but even in the baseband. So as we really started seeing true deployments in North Korea and the very, very early beginnings of that in China. We do have content both in radio, which we've traditionally always been strong in and also in the baseband.So I would say, yes. South Korea -- I would say, yes, we have higher content right now. I would also point out that 5G is going to be a -- I've said this in previous calls, 5G is going to be a larger deployment overall, compared to the previous -- the past generations. And we're also innovative quite a bit, right, with our SoCs, as well as the analog, really high performance analog that we've integrated for our RFSoCs. So I do think because of our capability, we will have more persistence in the past. However, yes, ASICs will come on board.I would say that in this first generation of deployment, it's not clear that will necessarily hang on to the baseband component, but there'll be follow-on with second and third generations. And again, are on the radio side we're very strong and even stronger than ever, and on the baseband side particularly when we come out with our 7-nanometer Versal product, I think, we have a good shot at having good longevity also even in baseband. -- Thank you. -- Welcome.Our next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Hi. This is Vinay calling in for Joe. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I wanted to follow-up on your comments on Zynq and MPSoC, right? Growth there remains very strong. Like how much of that is just TAM expansion due to new applications versus share gains that you're seeing? And like how much visibility do you have for that business like how should we think about growth over the next couple of years there? -- Yeah. I think it's attributed to both those and I would add one other. But let's first cover those two. I mean, certainly, we are winning in a lot of traditional applications and used cases that we have in the past and by the strength of both of our execution and the innovative architecture we're winning more. But there are, again, in many cases what we've displaced or the real competition we've had is more with ASSPs and other nontraditional competitors. So there's definitely TAM expansion.The third element I believe is everybody is moving toward more standard platforms. The whole intelligent connected world is really happening. People have data strategies, digital strategies and so they can't have custom kind of incompatible kind of solutions and this cuts across multiple end markets, right? So we think in general we see move toward more standardized platforms and the Zynq first and second generation are just absolutely ideal for that kind of architecture. -- Got it. That's very helpful. I wanted to follow-up on your Aerospace and Defense business. Traditionally there's been a little lumpy, but you're seeing real growth on new platforms and like how is the backlog there, and like anything you can share about your visibility for that business going forward? -- Yeah. I'll make a comment and maybe, Lorenzo, can in fact speak to the backlog. Let me just talk generally. I mean, yes, our overall Aerospace and Defense is definitely on track for a record on an annual basis. You'll see birth from quarter-to-quarter. It's cyclical in the sense that these are driven by the cadence of those programs and those programs, obviously, we have times when they are doing a lot of buying versus digesting and so forth. I will say from a trend perspective, we're encouraged that we're seeing a little bit more -- on a relative basis more rapid adoption of more advanced technologies than we've seen in the past in that segment. Now it's still a fairly long cycle to production from design win, nonetheless, we are seeing a bit of that change and then to the answer on backlog, I'll let Lorenzo. -- Yeah. No. I guess, I would say, simply that we don't breakout backlog by end market for disclosure. Our backlog in general for this quarter is quite strong. But as Victor pointed out, in A&D business or actually as you pointed out in your question, A&D business is lumpy. But if you look overall the trend year-on-year is significant growth based again on the expansion of the types of designs we're in, as well as the come to market with the designs that we won in the past. So I think both things set up the trend longer term with some broad strength. -- Got it. Very helpful. Congrats again. -- Thank you. -- Thank you, Vinayak.Our next question comes from line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question is on the gross margin side of things. Can you talk about, I guess, particularly on the comp side, what you're doing there, if at all, to drive margins higher, particularly with next-generation products? And how we should think about the trajectory as we move forward? And if I could just throw in the second question here. How are you thinking about tax rate into fiscal 2020? Thanks. -- Okay. We'll try to cover it all. -- Yeah. I'll cover the first and Lorenzo will definitely cover the second. So, yeah, I mean, in terms of the gross margin, you're right. I mean, as we have a big component of our growth is the actual production deployments now we're starting to see with 5G and because of that and a few other product mixes that does bring the gross margin down somewhat. I would say what do we do in terms of driving gross margin? Well, there are a number things that we do not just for wireless, but in general on what we do to drive our margin and that ranges from all kinds of cost saving issues, just disciplined in terms of other things on the business side.But I think the biggest thing and the RFSoC is a perfect example of that. We're innovating, so we are providing a great deal more value to our customers and we end up in the sense both profiting, the classic win-win, right? Because at the system level, we are actually saving cost, power, more, in fact, the weight. And because of that we do hold more value when we truly innovate and provide this capability that, in the case of RFSoCs no one has a product like that.So I think there is all the -- there's not one silver bullet we go, walking and tapping on all these things that we always do on an ongoing basis. But the big needle mover is when we innovate, right? And again starting with whom we integrated the SoC with the first actually Zynq and continuing that innovation roadmap is, I think, the big needle movers over time. -- So, I think, Victor, covered the gross margin piece quite comprehensively. So I'll just get on the tax rate. I will say we haven't provided specific guidance for FY 2020 on the tax rate. But if you look at the general expectations for tax in FY 2019, we were thinking we'd be in the 10% to 12% range. The quarter-to-quarter lumpiness has come from as the tax reform regulations have solidified, there are different pieces that we have to incorporate into the quarterly tax rate that we are providing for. But over the long-term I would expect to get back to that more normalized rate. But again I have to take the caveat, we haven't given specific FY 2020 guidance yet, C.J. Hope that helps.Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thank you very much. I had a question on China, Victor, and of course, all the concerns could change in a tweet. But how are you thinking about risk mitigation. You have a pretty meaningful exposure and I thought I heard you say that some of the 5G strength was coming from China as well. So just help us understand or give us your perspective on how you're thinking about it?And then my quick question follow-up is could you talk a little bit about the growth and the traction that you talked about that Alveo, if I'm pronouncing it correctly was the second half phenomena. So is that contributing to the margins being slightly below and just talk about the ramp that's there? Thank you. -- Okay. Yeah. The China trading situation, we have continued to monitor that very carefully. As you said, it's very difficult to predict. So certainly we think about what appropriate actions might be reasonable should certain scenarios occur, but really since that's really unpredictable and we don't want to just take action rashly, we're just going to watch it and then react, respond appropriately. So I think we thought in two different scenarios. But, clearly, right now for the facts, we know that the tariffs that are in place do impact us, where if the things stay the way they are, we will continue to do the business. But we have put thought into different scenarios. So I probably should just leave it at that, since again once it's quite speculative what could happen.To the question around Alveo and you did pronounced it correctly. We've already said that this fiscal year is going to be very modest revenue and it will become more meaningful next fiscal year and actually more in the second half, because we did only launched it in October and we only started shipping and production in November. So it's very early, but I would say that, I think, I had mentioned in earlier calls that the really early, very right out of the gate, there was very strong interest.I'd say, we're very comfortable happy where it is right now. I mentioned the qualification at Dell, there's activity with other OEMs, as well as partners. We're building out the channels, the infrastructure. We're engaged in a number of PoCs. And next fiscal year is when we see that going more -- transitioning more into production. So I'm very happy with it. It's a small amount right now. In terms of the margin piece, no, it doesn't really -- we don't anticipate it particularly impacting the margin. Again, we think we delivered tremendous value, not only in just the silicone and the board, but the software infrastructure that goes along with it. We will price it competitively, but we feel like we are delivering a lot of value. So we will see that as an exposure, let's say, and weakening the company's overall margin. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Okay. Great.Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I'll echo the congrats. You mentioned -- in Data Center TME, you highlighted TME being up, kind of just curious, how much that's 5G related? And then, you did mention in Data Center you had a couple of knock out quarters there, so maybe just update there. Is there any lumpiness or is it just smaller and you didn't mention it? Thanks. -- Yeah. On the TME side, there is some related to 5G specialty testers, high end testers. But actually there is also good amount of strength in the emulation and prototyping side of the world where our product strength is really quite unmatched. I think I mentioned before where we might see some degree of softening is more on say, the pure semiconductor test and some of the other areas. But as a whole, TME was strong and not just because of 5G. So that's maybe we think about it that way.With respect to the core Data Center, again, it is still relatively small and we said we had double-digit growth on a quarter-to-quarter basis and our year-on-year basis from small numbers it nearly doubled. But it's still relatively modest today, right? Again, we see all of that growing more materially next fiscal year. But we're quite happy about what we're seeing.In terms of lumpiness, I mean, I think, because things are emerging, yes, there is a degree of lumpiness. But I don't think we're anywhere close to seeing what steady state is. So I don't think intrinsically, I have no reason to believe intrinsically this will become a diversity kind of market. -- And I think some of the aggregate lumpiness that you might have, might be reflected in the business results have been more attributed to the cryptocurrency. As we've said, that declined in the quarter. -- Yeah. And again just to put that in perspective, cryptocurrency is a very small percentage. But because we're talking about a relatively small of our core Data Center that is strategically interesting is big enough that those fluctuations can impact that on the near-term basis. But Lorenzo said that we don't consider that part of the core business. -- Thanks.Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi. This is Charles Kazarian on behalf of John Pitzer. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congrats on the strong results. You have previously painted a picture of a less steep, but longer rev ramp for 5G. But with year-on-year comps rev up about 40% year-on-year, it looks like this ramp is perhaps a bit steeper than the prior cycle and December rev only about 5% lower than the 2014 peak. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on, one, how this ramp is played out relative to expectations, say, 12 months ago? And then, two, just the content growth you are seeing has already brought you close to the 2014 peak levels just given we're still relatively early innings in this build out? Thank you. -- Yeah. I -- clearly, we didn't anticipate the ramp starting as early as it did. I think we said that on the last call. So the start of this ramp is happening faster than we had thought. And the strength for coming out of the gate is pretty strong. I did allude to the fact that we're shipping both in some cases not all, in some cases both in baseband, as well as in the radio. So I think a combination of all those is what's giving the strong strength.I will say that this speaks to one of our strengths relative to ASICs, right. I mean, just again we've talked about one of our key value props in multiple markets is, you're not high to get the market on tape-out cycles as much. Once we've come up with products, people could come out with new capability very rapidly. But I would still say if you look at there will still be some adversity into this market. That's unlike what we said about Data Center. I don't think 5G is going to be just as a steady climb. But this is the early -- this is still the earlier deployment, we definitely still believe that in 2020 and beyond that there will be more strength and more growth. So, yes, this is a bit stronger than what we anticipated, but I think there's more to come. So that help? -- Thank you -- yeah. Thank you very much. Very helpful. -- Sure. Sure.Our next question comes from John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a follow-up question for you on 5G, Victor. When you look at RFSoCs, right, you've benefited from the discrete integration of some of these analog components that historically have been analog peers have played into. They have also introduced integrated products as well and everybody seems to be talking about gaining share on 5G here. I'm wondering if you could just comment, are we talking about just on expanding TAM and everybody is benefiting or are there potential kind of relative losers and winners here? I was wondering if you could just provide your perspective on that? -- There is definitely an expanding TAM, because again, I think, 5G over time will definitely be a much bigger deployment. It's so much more rich in terms of what it's doing, the performance is going about orders of magnitude, so there's going to be TAM expansion.I do think that we will also gain share, right? People are as you say playing the game coming from the other side, perhaps. But I would say that still today and we haven't heard of any credible real comparable product people are trying to do integration that are more in advanced packaging kind of mode, which is not the same thing as fully monolithic integration. We already have a roadmap for follow-on products, not only in 16-nanometers, but 7-nanometers.So I think it is going to be both and by the way this is simply just an integration play. People are rearchitecting the radio, right. And the different layers in terms of what's in the radio and what sort of at the next level and up in the cloud and (inaudible) I think they got. So there is also disruption in the overall architecture and we enable the things that I think are going to be more challenged than some other traditional solutions. -- Got it. And then my follow-up is just a question on kind of the Chinese risk components. Obviously, there's different perspectives on those, but do you think some of the strength that you are seeing in comps is potential pull-ins by Chinese OEMs ahead of a potential export ban on US components there? -- So, look, we're very sensitive to that situation. So we definitely triangulate from multiple perspective and also we work on various business things to sort of filter that out. So we don't believe what's going on is just pure pull-ins or any sort of double bookings.I would also add that, our strength in wireless is not just in China. I mean all our Tier 1s across all the geographies we're seeing strength. So, yes, China is an important region, but it's certainly not only China. So that's important. -- I think that's an important point. And as Victor said, we try to triangulate the business we see through what we're learning about the deployments and trying to map as best we can that our demand matches, but we think deployment demand is because we're cognizant of that kind of risk. So, yeah, we don't see that any significant degree, if at all. -- Great. Thank you.Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Just a quick follow-up on the prior question. So specifically to Huawei given the geopolitical climate, do you see some impact on the revenue to that customer and this may be outside of China? And does that have any impact on the timing of the ramp that you see for 5G in which so far you seem to see is ahead of what you previously expected? -- Well, again, this is a very -- I guess, what I'd say complex situation and it's not just us, of course, it's the whole industry. So we monitor this very carefully. I am on the FIA board and there are other things that we do to try and keep a very careful track of the situation. I would say that, so far we are not seeing anything at all material in terms of the business with Huawei. But we're watching that very carefully.In terms of the ramping earlier than expected, I want to repeat that the strength is more on the South Korea deployment than what I'd say. Just -- it's just the very beginning I'd say of what seems to be the start of the China plan. I mean, there was some initial licenses signed of some spectrum is signed, but it's still very early on the China side. So what we are seeing is -- and I think we expressed this last quarter as well is real strength in South Korea in terms of production deployment. -- Okay. And then just a quick follow-up in ADAS. It looks like this primary level two opportunities in ADAS of industrywide. Does the potential push out of higher level of autonomous driving having an impact on the ramp of your Zynq products in automotive? And is -- are your Zynq products targeting more like level four type of opportunities? -- I think we are -- we have a lot of activity both in more pure store ADAS, as well as autonomous driving, as well as other features that I'm not sure how you've been exactly like a lot of these occupant monitoring systems to just have a really nice customer experience. Some could be safety-related like browsing, detection and things. Others are just convenience and a better experienced.So I'd say, we are in all these kinds of applications and I did say in my opening remarks the ones that are geared toward autonomous driving whether it's four or whatever, those are more mid-term long-term opportunities. The revenue today is largely around ADAS and other kinds of heads-up display and other kinds of better passenger driver experiences. So I don't think our success there is super dependent on really when very autonomous higher levels of autonomous driving deploys. -- Great. Very useful. Thank you.Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'm hoping you can quantify the impact of crypto. I think it was at the Analyst Day you talked about this actually being a sort of growth opportunity for you as you are engaging with the OEMs and that's -- or let's say company is building mining farms in that space. Should we assume that revenue is approximately zero and we're not going to talk about it much anymore or is this still sort of target business and growth opportunity in your view? -- So I actually don't think we convey that we think there is a big opportunity. I think we get conveyed opportunistic and we were seeing at that time some increased usage. I think we raised it and not too long on the  , because it is volatile and we want everybody to be clear about that. But we've always said, when asked like, look its low tens of millions of revenue on a quarterly basis, and again, from an annual basis it's low single-digit. Again, it's opportunistic, so we will service those customers, but we don't focus on it. It's non-strategic.So -- and clearly like any other solution, I mean, when currency is quite depressed then it goes down and when it goes up, I think, maybe one thing that's a little bit different for us too is that when things are changing like when they are changing some of the algorithms or how they get to the various calculations that can sometimes be benefit us. What we do think may be longer term might be of an opportunity, but we've never -- it's not anything we quantified today. But it is Blockchain technology as a whole, not as they relate to crypto. So, anyways, hopefully that clarifies how we really think about it. -- Helps a little bit. One other question if I can squeeze it in. On your sort of mid range growth opportunity, we're seeing your year-over-year revenue growth accelerating in the quarter and the guide over 20%. Now despite some shortfalls in crypto and industrial and wireline not doing great just because everyone else is seeing growth, decline pretty precipitously in some cases going negative, when you're doing sort of mid range plan and not a quarter or two out, but let's say four, five, six quarters. Do you believe that you have an opportunity to continue this rate of growth or maybe even accelerate it when the problem spots to go away or do you think this is really a pretty unique and special time in the company's history and we revert to something more, let's say, normal for relative to your history and relative to the industry? -- Look at the last Investor Analyst Day in May, we said that we believe that we can drive a 10-plus percent growth on a sustained basis, which is a departure from our history. That still stands. We're not giving any update of FY'20 or beyond guidance at this point, so we'll hear that again in the next Investor Conference. But certainly we still do stand by the -- and we are executing strategies and so forth to do that 10%-plus, right? Clearly we're well ahead of that now, we -- but again I would say wait to hear from that.But again that goal is already a departure from history. And if you look at what we deliver and that's why I've said if you heard or you attended the XTF conference that we had is that we're not an FPGA company anymore, right. We are a platform company. We have -- we are delivering high performance analog, Versal ACAP is going to change the game over time. So we are a different company and that's why we believe we can sustain double-digit growth. -- Yeah. I mean both -- I mean you can just think about in simplest terms, we've significantly expanded the addressable markets we serve and we are gaining share. So we are, as Victor said, fundamentally different and we -- our outlook includes that. -- Very good. Thanks guys.Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Great. Thanks very much. I had a question on OpEx. You've been growing OpEx sort of in line are consistent with revenue growth over the past couple of quarters. I think you're guiding to a pretty big number for the March quarter as well. As we look forward into fiscal year 2020, how should we think about the rate of OpEx growth relative to revenue growth? I think, Victor, in the past you've talked about big opportunities facing the company therefore you need to be aggressive. At the same time, I think, you've talked about being a little bit more selective or a little more disciplined with OpEx. So if you can sort of comment on that that would be helpful? -- Yeah. I mean in one sentence I suppose my response will be a little boring and that, yes, you just repeat it, there's no change in that perspective. We do want to be able to sustain this growth. We think the opportunity we have in on a strategic level and long arc of thing is very significant. But it does take investment. We just take tape out our 7-nanometer product, $36 billion transistors, right? This is an incredibly complex and powerful product. As you can imagine that's the first product we have -- we announced when we launched it at XTF six subfamily. So we are going to continue to invest in 7-nanometers. We're not completely done in 16, because of the strength of 16 we've gotten some additional interest and some follow-on. So we are going to drive this growth and we are going to balance earnings expansion, as well as continue to invest, so we can keep this kind of growth up. -- Right. So, the quarter-to-quarter step up was exactly in line with what we had provided at our -- for an annual guide. So it's within the parameters we've already discussed all based on the strategies that Victor just articulated. And so -- we haven't -- and we're not going to in this call give FY'20 guidance. But I think the strategy remains consistent and it's consistent, if you refer back to the previous question on how we're going to drive revenue growth in the future. -- Got it. Thank you. And then I have a quick follow-up on M&A. Your names have been in sort of the news quite often over the past couple of months. Without obviously talking specifics, if you can remind us what characteristics or what conditions you would look for in a company or business when filtering through potential targets? That will be helpful. Thank you. -- Yeah. I mean, if you look at the DeePhi acquisition which we did, so we can talk about that, is strongly aligned with our strategic goals right? Obviously, we feel that we have a very strong position from the cloud to the edge to endpoint in all kinds of applications and artificial intelligence and machine learning in particular is going to be deployed across all of those. DeePhi is very strong and had capability. They were designing to our platform. So that was obviously to tuck-in. But the point being that the way we think about the rationale be strong, constructiveness toward achieving our strategic goals. And we'll continue to have for tuck-ins and if there's a business we are prepared certainly to do that as well. And I guess, it's probably just best to leave it at that. We wouldn't be doing these kind of adjacency kind of things that seem more like an unrelated bolt-on just because we think there is some nice deal going on. It would be very strategically aligned. -- I mean, I think, there's -- that's a very disciplined strategic filter that Victor talked about. And then very clear eye on providing financial return in the long-term. -- Thanks so much. Congrats. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is now open. -- Hello. This is Wayne Loeb for Chris Danely. Thank you for taking my question. Can I ask what percentage of your revenue is specifically coming from China and what is the year-on-year growth in China? Also how big are sales from ZTE and Huawei right now? -- So, I'll deal with this kind of in the reverse order. We are not disclosing any customer-specific revenue information. We don't have any 10% customers. So we'll keep it at that. Last year in our K you'd see that our China revenue was $664 million, which is about a quarter of our overall revenue. I would think it, year-to-date it's slightly above that, but it's trending along with the business. -- Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up, are you seeing any extension in lead times given all the revenue growth? -- There were some components for a while where there's some challenges and we've, I am sorry, you're talking about ours... -- Yeah. -- Yeah. I'm sorry, right, I thought you're talking about components, but you need our lead time. I think what -- we've been getting good, really good customer evaluations in terms of our lead time. And so, now, again, in a few critical components in terms of the 5G since that's been very strong, we've delivered, but I wouldn't say that it's not an effort to sort of do that. But no we are not really pushing out in general lead times. -- We have -- on some of our newer products, we have extended lead times. So we work very carefully with our customers to deliver to their needs. So its point issues not systematic. -- Yeah. And I think in general we are compared to peers, we are still doing very well in terms of delivery and lead times.Yeah. -- Thank you very much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Chris Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. Congrats on a super quarter. Victor, I know you've talked about Intel perhaps pushing density for 10-nanometer a little too far here. And I know there's been a lot of discussions about architecture here. But can you talk to us about your view on getting the node first? This used to be the big battle between you and Altera. If you were to get there first, what is the six-month lead mean for your general business in your opinion? -- Yeah. I mean, I would say, it still does matter for certain programs in markets, and certainly, when we are talking about pure FPGAs, it had a stronger correlation to how people will do. But since we have moved beyond pure FPGAs that's why I think architecture is becoming more and more important. It isn't just capacity of logic sales because we offer a whole lot more value than that.Additionally, I would say that this has been very silicon-focused, but all the tools, the IP and now higher levels of the software stack that we're now providing, Ergo are saying that, we should think of it as more of a platform company that's also adding value and therefore barriers. So we are still continuing to execute very well relative to Intel PSG from a pure silicon, but it is actually -- the barrier is actually even higher than that, because they are not innovating like we're innovating in terms of the architecture or the technologies we're integrating and also the whole software stack.So having said that, we continue to watch them, we respect Intel, of course. You never want to get arrogant in any way shape or form. But we feel really good about what we are doing and I mean I think we have been leading from the front for a while, so we are not going to let up. -- Great. And then, Victor, perhaps, your expectation for AI core is the idea here kind of to cede the market with Alveo to kind of prime the pump for AI core? Is that where you guys are expecting kind of Data Center inflection for the inference market or do you expect AI core to be kind of that next step in the evolution? -- No. It's not evolutionary. It is definitely more revolutionary like we are going to get significant factors of improvement. In the AI core from the inference market I want to expand to make sure that that the inference market we may not just in the Data Center, but we see that again on edge computing, as well as really endpoints. Versal including the AI Core will be using the automotive. We have a lot of strong interest in automotive. We certainly have interest in the Data Center and it's multi-market, right? So we really do see that is going to expand quite a bit.I think, Alveo, I wouldn't say, it as strongly correlates to AI core per se, but I think this whole thing of delivering a platform, right, not just the physical board piece, but the software stack that lets you just in this case a very standard base infrastructure and Data Center piece that new cards in the future other types of Data Center cards. In selective areas you're going to see us do more platform kind of things, right. -- Thanks and congrats again. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Hi, guys. -- Hi. -- Victor, just a question on the SmartNIC market. I think you mentioned a couple of design wins in there. Could you put that into perspective as to how big that market is and when do you think that ramps will start and how that might impact your revenue growth? -- Yeah. Again, we've always talked about both the compute segment, the storage, as well as the network in the SmartNIC. I would say, SmartNIC is probably the second of the three, right. Where in the long arc of things compute could be the largest. But having said that, I would say is that SmartNIC unlike in compute is less criticality of us making it kind of super simplistic in the sense of being needing to operate only at a very high level design abstraction not knowing thing about the hardware. The nature of the customers we're engaging with on SmartNIC are much more technical.So the good news is we don't have to -- we are not -- there's not a critical dependency on that piece of it. And also since we're not trying to support a broad swath of ICs and things like that, it's not an ecosystem element either. So from those perspective, it's very attractive. It's also nice because we're seeing customer pull not just pushing, right. So those are -- we see that that is a very important area for us. I think it's not just us, but I think people are doing ASIC. So it's clear that other people see value in the architecture of doing offload, obviously, for face value also just getting more bandwidth into the Data Center, as well as doing other things like security and so on and so forth. So it's a very attractive market.I'm always reluctant to calling kind of like a self inflection point. I view it as we are getting strong design wins across many end customers, regions and applications. That's a good thing. Unfortunately we can't -- I can't publicly talk about some of this either, but we're feeling very, very encouraged about design win momentum. -- Great. And then, just as a follow-up. I think in your comments about 5G baseband, I think, you kind of said, you won't be able to hang on to some of the early designs wins in the preproduction baseband. I just want to understand that comment a bit more. I mean, if you can please elaborate on that. What do you mean by you won't be able to hang on? I mean, are you just seeing kind of an ASIC transition that we normally see here or are you seeing something else? Just want to understand a little better. Thank you. -- Sure. And I guess, this is always this thing that I'm trying to do of being very candid, at the same time, not trying to get to the thing that we don't have a very good opportunity here, right? -- Okay. -- So what I mean is, so 5G is not just a single point in time. There really clearly are going to be generations of 5G, because 5G is really umbrella of standards, as well as technology. And the very early deployments that we're seeing now it doesn't have the full features and capabilities. So you're going to see wave of 5G technologies, as well as, of course, deployment. We are participating in baseband which traditionally we haven't. And that's part of the growth, right?I think in this first generation, certainly in certain areas we do think that when ASICs catch up, because again they tend to lag that we'll lose some of that baseband. Hopefully, we're still holding on to some of it. What I was saying is that, with our similar Versal (ph), because that is still more powerful in some of the engagement that we're seeing that we believe we have a much stronger shot of maintaining baseband and of course continue to expand on our strength in radio and so forth, right? And by the way in 5G there's going to be more radio, so it's not like our success hangs on the baseband, but of course, we would like to capture those value as we can. So I hope that helps a little bit more in my comment. -- That helps a lot. Thanks, Victor. Congrats again. -- Sure. -- Take care. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is now open. -- It's just good quarter again. Just wondering when you look at 5G side, obviously, comp grew nicely. How do you -- how would you characterize to growth this figure (ph) in 2019 calendar year, I'm saying on the Data Center side? And then you mentioned briefly about FPGAs in getting traction in Amazon and Alibaba and Huawei, I think, you can give a some more color on the outlook there for 2019? -- Okay. So for 2019, obviously, we gave guidance for the current quarter. We're not giving guidance for fiscal 2020, which is a good portion of calendar 2019, right? So I think you might want to wait to hear when we have our Investor and Analyst Day for broader guidance. But, again, I guess, what I would say on the 5G, these are early deployments. But again you're going to see more of it, right? These are just -- these are the early deployments and it will still have some (inaudible) to it. So on a quarter-by-quarter basis you are going to see some big ups and down.But on an integrated basis, right, 5G will be higher in peak and higher in the overall area on the curve if you will for revenue. I think there is no question that's going to happen. And obviously this will be -- we are stronger, we are more strongly positioned today than we were in some of the past generations for all the reasons we've discussed earlier in terms of RFSoC, Versal and future generations and even our 16-nanometer today, even in the baseband. So we feel very good about 5G, although you will see some parsing (ph) so, and again we are not guiding on detail in FY '20 at this point. -- Hey, Liz. We'll take one more question. -- So I think one last thing on the second part you asked our Data Center and FAS, I think. I mentioned that we have additional FaaS engagements, I didn't identify them, because unfortunately I'm not at liberty to do that at this point in time. But what I'm saying is that, we have some additional engagement beyond what has already been publicly announced which is Amazon (inaudible). We've also had subsequently Alibaba and Huawei who have deployed in production. We are seeing good activity there, but I was really referring to the progress we have and that we have other ones that today I can't name, but we have other ones. So there will be more FAS deployment. So this is the takeaway there. -- Got it. And just one follow-up if I may. On the FPGA side, on 5G, obviously, good traction there you see in the radio numbers. Do you see any competition from ASICs coming kind of being a low cost alternative or is it too early in the FPGA ramp, you still kind of looking the technology ramped more there. -- Yeah. Rreally look the quick answer there is what I was referring to the fact that in the first generation of wave of 5G deployments, on the baseband side not the radio we might not have persistency in that, pulling that and that is because ASICs might come along to displace some of that in the baseband side. So, yes, there is and there always has traditionally been some ASIC competition. But, again, we are persistent certainly in the radio and we believe in second -- third generation we should see some persistence in the baseband. -- Got it. Thanks lot. -- Yeah.And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. -- Okay. Well thanks everyone for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific 8:00 PM Eastern Time. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit us on our Investor Relations website.

"all Street's benchmark averages were struggling for direction on Thursday as a flurry of headlines and gloomy global economic data overshadowed strong quarterly results from the chipmaker and airline industry. Heavy losses in consumer staples were weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average while the Nasdaq Composite is staying above water on strength in semiconductors.Selling erupted before the open on Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's now infamous quote that US and China are ""miles and miles away"" from a trade resolution. While Ross's remark was intended to underscore the complexity of a mutually beneficial trade deal, it torpedoed the earnings-fueled uptrade, sending the Dow and S&P 500 into the red, at least for a while.Compounding the negative price action was European Central Bank president Mario Draghi's warnings about downside risks to the EU economy that trailed bearish European PMIs, specifically the German manufacturing PMI that fell into contractionary mode for the first time in five years. Draghi said that headwinds from trade tensions, geopolitics and Brexit have precluded any possibility for the ECB to alter monetary policy until at least after the summer.On the earnings front, upbeat results from Switzerland's STMicroelectronics (  ), Lam Research (  ) and Xilinx (  ), along with results from American Airlines (  ), JetBlue (  ) and Southwest (LUV) helped prop up markets earlier but could not deflect the bearish undertones that weighed on the remaining sectors of the S&P 500.Economic data was a mixed bag. Initial jobless claims fell 13,000 to their lowest level in 49 years; the preliminary manufacturing PMI for January rose to a two-month high of 54.9, while the services sector dropped to a four-month low of 54.2; leading economic indicators contracted by 0.1%; and the Kansas City Fed manufacturing index improved to 5.0 from 3.0 in December.Crude oil was up $0.49 to $53.11 per barrel. Natural gas was up $0.15 to $3.13 per 1 million BTU. Gold was down $3.00 to $1,281.00 an ounce, while silver was down $0.06 to $15.32 an ounce. Copper was down $0.01 to $2.64 per pound.Among energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund was up 1.36% to $11.20 with the United States Natural Gas Fund up 2.20% to $26.87.

"n Jan 25,  was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of the company scaled a new 52-week high of $107.65, eventually closing at $106.6 on Jan 24. Moreover, shares gained about 18.4% in yesterday's trading session.Investors seem to be impressed by the company's third-quarter fiscal 2019 performance wherein both earnings and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also witnessed a year-over-year improvement. This upside can be attributed to the company's strength in Advanced Products, which soared 51% year over year, and broad-based growth across most of its end markets.Looking forward to the fiscal fourth quarter, Xilinx expects revenues to be in the range of $815-$830 million. This is ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $775.5 million.Notably, the stock has appreciated 52.1% in the past year versus the S&P 500 Composite's decline of 7%.Xilinx is witnessing a strong uptick in the Communications market, driven by an improved Wireless business, which is benefiting from early 5G production, pre-5G deployments and LTE upgrades. Notably, 5G deployments in South Korea and a very early start of ramping up the 5G deployments in China are key drivers. The growing usage of Zynq RFSoCs and ACAP products for 5G deployments by both basebands and radios is a positive.Additionally, major design wins from hyperscalers globally for accelerating applications beyond FPGA as a Service (FaaS) enhanced results. The company's software defined development environment, SDAccel, is helping it stay ahead of Intel  in datacenter acceleration. Notably, with regard to FaaS, the company recorded additional engagements beyond previously announced deployments with Amazon  , Alibaba  and Huawei.Xilinx also expanded its portfolio of Alveo accelerator cards with U280 products apart from U200 & U250. The company projects modest revenue growth from Alveo this year but expects it to be a more meaningful contributor in the next fiscal year.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) provider to an all-programmable devices producer is aiding it to gain a sizeable market share. To this end, its newly launched 7nm ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) Versal platform is touted to be a game changer.The above-mentioned tailwinds have raised investors' optimism on the stock and will likely boost the company's share price in the coming days. | You can see Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Meanwhile, Automotive remained flat while Consumers declined slightly.Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (27% of total revenues) rose 17% on a year-over-year basis, boosted by better-than-expected growth in A&D.

Key design wins from hyperscalers globally for accelerating applications beyond FPGA as a Service (FaaS) bettered results. Moreover, with regard to FaaS, it had additional engagements beyond previously announced deployments with Amazon  , Alibaba  and Huawei.Excluding cryptocurrency, Data Center growth nearly doubled year over year.

"pooked by comments from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and gloomy expectations for the European economy from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, US stock futures surrendered early gains as Dow and S&P futures retreated into negative territory. Buoyed by gains in the chipmaker sector on strong quarterly results from Lam Research (  ), STMicroelectronics (  ) and Xilinx (  ), the Nasdaq was holding onto a modest gain.Trade tensions were rekindled when Ross said the US and China were ""miles and miles"" away from getting a resolution on trade during an interview on CNBC, while at the same time Draghi cautioned that headwinds to the EU economy have ""moved to the downside."" The one-two punch drove stock futures sharply lower with industrials leading the pack lower.Before share prices were jerked lower by Ross and Draghi, stock futures were trading higher as investors shrugged off additional signs of slowing economic growth and focused instead on upbeat quarterly results in the airline and semiconductor industries.After warnings from the International Monetary Fund and central bankers, indications that the global economy was slowing was manifested early Thursday with a slew of PMIs across Europe showing that manufacturing in Germany fell into contraction mode and EU manufacturing teetering on the brink.The data was overshadowed, however, by quarterly results from Swiss chipmaker STMicroelectronics that drove the tech sector higher.

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.24%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this computer chipmaker would pos  of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of 16%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Xilinx, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry, posted revenues of $800.06 million for the quarter ended December 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.79%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $631.19 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the  .Xilinx shares have added about 6.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5%.While Xilinx has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power o  estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Xilinx was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

"Chicago, IL - January 23, 2019 -  Tech Data Corporation  as the Bull of the Day, Tailored Brands, Inc.  asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Texas Instruments  and Xilinx  .Here is a synopsis of all four stocks: : is one of the world's biggest technology distributors. The company certifies, trains, instructs, and supports their reseller customers, and helps configure, install, and finance their purchases. Tech Data's end-to-end portfolio of products, services and solutions, highly specialized skills, and expertise in next-generation technologies enable channel partners to bring to market the products and solutions the world needs to connect, grow, and advance.At the end of last November, Tech Data reported third quarter numbers that blew straight past estimates.Adjusted earnings of $3.02 per share handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19 per share, while adjusted net income soared 50% to $116.3 million.Revenues climbed 11% from the prior year period to $9.34 billion, also beating our consensus estimate. All of its regions performed very well, with sales in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific up 13%, 9%, and 6%, respectively.Tech Data also paid down $100 of debt and repurchased $44 million in Q3.In the earnings release, CEO Rich Hume said that the strong results seen in the third quarter ""reflect the powerful combination of our end-to-end portfolio and strong execution by our global teams. Theyalso validate the strategic role we play in the IT supply chain -- delivering high value through our end-to-end portfolio to channel partners across the broad spectrum of IT products and solutions.""Over the past three months, TECD has gained over 30%, and shares have bounced back nicely from the market pullback seen at the end of last year.Estimates have been rising lately too, pushing the stock towards a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).For the current fiscal year, Tech Data's earnings are expected to grow around 20% year-over-year. Four analysts have upped their estimate, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved nearly a dollar higher in the past 60 days from $9.99 to $10.94 per share.Next year looks pretty strong too. The consensus estimate sits at $11.50 per share, with three upward revisions in the last two months.Looking ahead to its current fiscal fourth quarter, Tech Data expects revenues in the range of $10.5 billion to $10.9 billion on top of adjusted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. The lower ends of the both the top and bottom line are well above consensus estimates. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues falls roughly in the middle of both estimate ranges ($4.08 per share and $10.7 billion).Like most tech stocks, TECD couldn't escape that volatile run that hit the broader market late last year, but the company appears to be on a good path going forward, and looks to continue its outperformance. For those investors looking for a technology stock to add to their portfolio, TECD should definitely be on the shortlist. :Based in Houston, Texas,  is a specialty retailer of men's suits and tuxedo rentals across the U.S. and Canada. The company used to be known as The Men's Wearhouse, and provides customers with a wide range of suiting options including suit separates, sport coats, slacks, dress shirts, sportwear and outerwear, and shoes and accessories.In the past six months, shares of Tailored Brands have fallen around 48%. Disappointing guidance in its third-quarter earnings report overshadowed an earnings beat and left investors scrambling.Earnings of $1.01 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents thanks to lower interest expenses and a lower tax rate; earnings also increased from 75 cents reported in the prior year quarter.Revenues of $812.7 million missed our consensus but was up 0.2% year-over-year. Retail comparable sales jumped 2.3%, driven by a 1.7% increase at Men's Wearhouse and a 3.8% increase at Jos. A. Bank.Investors were most concerned about Tailored Brands' big guidance cut. For the full year, the retailer now expects to earn between $2.30 and $2.35 per share on a non-GAAP basis, down from a previous guidance range of $2.35 to $2.50.""As the third quarter progressed we saw a softening of comparable sales due to lower transactions at Men's Wearhouse and that trend continued into November. As a result, we have taken a more cautious outlook on fourth quarter comparable sales for Men's Wearhouse,"" said Executive Chairman Dinesh Lathi. This ""softening"" led to the company's full year guidance cut.It didn't take long for analysts to lower their estimates for fiscal 2019, and two have cut their earnings outlook in the last 60 days; our consensus has fallen 20 cents, down from $2.50 to $2.30 per share, bu  could see year-over-year growth of 4.5%.The consensus estimate has fallen for next fiscal year, too, down 39 cents from $2.91 to $2.52 per share. Two analysts have also cut their estimates for this time period as well.TLRD is now Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In addition to slashing its outlook for the year, Tailored Brands cut its guidance for the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter recently. Due to weaker-than-expected performance at Jos. A. Bank, the company now expects comparable sales to be flat in Q4 and adjusted loss per share of $0.34 to $0.29, down from a previous range of $0.29 to $0.24.The fourth-quarter reporting cycle is currently underway, with a significant number o  s slated to be released this week.The start to the earnings season has not been very impressive. According to the  as of Jan 18, tech sector earnings are expected to decelerate meaningfully in the fourth quarter, up +3.8%, after back-to-back quarters of very strong growth.The recent market-wide volatility and concerns have definitely impacted the semiconductor stocks. Moreover, the ongoing trade war between the United States and China has created a volatile environment that is not conducive for investments. Also, volatility in foreign exchange, primarily due to current macro-economic scenario and headwinds in the emerging markets, does not bode well.However, robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products, owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things (""IoT""), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (""ADAS""), gaming, wearables, drones, virtual reality/augmented reality (""VR/AR"") devices, artificial intelligence (""AI""), and cryptocurrencies, is fueling massive growth in the space.Two semiconductor stocks, namely Texas Instruments and Xilinx, are scheduled to announce their respective quarterly results tomorrow. Let's have a close look at the factors that will likely impact their results.We expect Texas Instruments' fourth-quarter earnings to be driven by strength in several higher-margin and high-growth market areas. The company's expanding exposure in industrial and automotive markets should benefit the upcoming results.Also, the analog segment should have performed well during the quarter, driven by TI's compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output.However, sluggishness in the company's embedded processing unit due to weak performing processors remains a concern and may continue to impact its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. This segment was down 4% year over year in the las  ed quarter as well, owing to weak performance of processors and sluggishness in the communications equipment market.Also, rising competition, particularly in auto chips, is currently a major headwind for Texas Instruments.We expect strength across majority of the end markets to drive Xilinx's fiscal third-quarter results. Solid performances of Communications businesses, as well as broad-based growth at Data Center, Testing, Measurement, and Emulation (TME) plus Industrial segments are likely to act as catalysts.Also, the wireless business should continue to benefit from LTE upgrades and the early deployment of 5G, thereby expanding its top-line growth.However, increasing operating expenses of the company due to higher employee compensation, including profit sharing and sales incentive, might impact profits in the quarter to be reported.In addition, the full integration of DeePhi acquisition will likely be an overhang on its margins in the quarter. Additionally, intensifying competition from Intel is a negative for Xilinx and may impact its bottom line.

" (NASDAQ: XLNX)  in 2018 thanks to a string of solid product development moves and impressive contract wins, which have allowed it to keep  in the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) market. Not surprisingly, the chipmaker has caught a lot of attention of late, and analysts expect it to sustain its terrific run in 2019.Higher data center spending and the beginning of 5G deployments are expected to drive Xilinx's growth in 2019 and beyond. The company will have to pass its first major test on Jan. 23, when it is expected to release its fiscal third-quarter results, as that will be critical in setting the tone for the remainder of the year.Let's see what's expected of Xilinx and why it is all set to begin the year with a bang.Image Source: Getty Images.Analysts expect Xilinx's revenue to jump 22% year over year to $770 million, while earnings are expected to shoot up from $0.05 a share in the prior-year period to $0.85. The top-line expectation is in line with the company's own guidance. Similarly, Xilinx should easily meet the earnings estimates, as it had reported earnings of $0.87 per share on revenue of $746 million during the second quarter.Investors should remember that Xilinx had raised its full-year guidance in October last year thanks to a spate of new deals. Demand for the company's data-center-specific chips has been increasing at a terrific pace due to demand from major cloud service providers. AWS, for instance, has doubled the availability of its Xilinx-powered FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) cloud server to eight regions.Similarly, Chinese cloud giant  is now offering FaaS commercially along with Huawei, while  has been reportedly looking to deploy Xilinx's chips across half of its Azure cloud servers. Apart from these, the company has already started witnessing the benefits of early 5G deployments and 4G upgrades.So it won't be surprising to see Xilinx beating estimates and issuing strong guidance yet again.Xilinx is taking advantage of several opportunities that are in their early phases of growth. The chipmaker was recently selected by German auto components supplier ZF to power its latest self-driving platform. This is the first time that automakers will have an option to use Xilinx's FPGAs to power  self-driving cars instead of a graphics card from  , opening an entirely new opportunity for the company's programmable chips.Xilinx has supplied chips to more than 160 million automotive systems so far. Around half of them are being used to power driver-assistance systems, so the move into self-driving systems is the next logical step for Xilinx. The company can win big with this move, as the market for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) is growing at an annual pace of 19%, according to Grand View Research.Meanwhile, Xilinx is taking a crack at the solid-state drive (SSD) market as well. That's another huge opportunity, as SSDs are gaining traction in data centers thanks to their faster performance, the potential for larger storage capacity, and smaller but flexible form factors. The SSD market is expected to hit $60.7 billion in revenue by 2023 as compared to $26.4 billion in 2017.Xilinx can take a bite out of this market thanks to its partnership with  , which has integrated the former's FPGA accelerator to bring higher processing power and lower power consumption to SSDs. Analysts believe that Xilinx's chips will boost the performance of Samsung's SmartSSDs by 2.8 to 3.3 times, which is why they can be deployed in data centers to tackle artificial intelligence workloads.What's more, Samsung isn't the only one integrating Xilinx's chips into SSDs. The likes of NGD Systems, Smart IOPS, and ScaleFlux have already tapped Xilinx's FPGAs to bring such ""computational SSDs"" to the market that are capable of tackling workloads at the storage level itself, allowing data center operators to lower operating costs and boost performance.The above catalysts are just some of the reasons why Xilinx has been able to beat the broader semiconductor market weakness. The company's strategy of going after markets with solid growth potential has paid off handsomely so far, and there's no reason why it shouldn't work going forward. As such, Xilinx looks poised to deliver another beat and raise this time, which should ensure that its rally continues.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 23.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four reported quarters, the average positive surprise being 8.74%.In the las  ed quarter, the company delivered earnings of 87 cents per share, much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents and the prior-year quarter's figure of 65 cents.Revenues increased 19% year over year to $746.3 million and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $710.3 million.For third-quarter fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $760-$780 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Xilinx is benefiting from growth across majority of the end markets. Solid performances of its Communications businesses and broad based growth at Data Center, Testing, Measurement, and Emulation (TME) plus Industrial segments are buoying investor confidence in the company's near-term prospects.In the last reported quarter, better-than-expected growth in wired revenues was a positive. Moreover, a strong wireless business, which benefited from LTE upgrades, early deployment of 5G across multiple geographies and preparation for 5G deployment, drove results. Although management expects 5G to ramp up mostly in 2020, acceleration in deployments, particularly in Korea, makes it optimistic.Moreover, the company expects a strong uptick from Data Center and TME segment, Industrial, Aerospace and Defense (A&D) segment as well. A&D, which declined in the last reported quarter, is expected to recover in the December quarter.We are optimistic about the surge in demand for Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGAs among data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS).

"he fourth-quarter reporting cycle is currently underway, with a significant number o  s slated to be released this week.The start to the earnings season has not been very impressive. According to the  as of Jan 18, tech sector earnings are expected to decelerate meaningfully in the fourth quarter, up +3.8%, after back-to-back quarters of very strong growth.The recent market-wide volatility and concerns have definitely impacted the semiconductor stocks. Moreover, the ongoing trade war between the United States and China has created a volatile environment that is not conducive for investments. Also, volatility in foreign exchange, primarily due to current macro-economic scenario and headwinds in the emerging markets, does not bode well.However, robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products, owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things (""IoT""), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (""ADAS""), gaming, wearables, drones, virtual reality/augmented reality (""VR/AR"") devices, artificial intelligence (""AI""), and cryptocurrencies, is fueling massive growth in the space.Two semiconductor stocks, namely Texas Instruments  and Xilinx  , are scheduled to announce their respective quarterly results tomorrow. Let's have a close look at the factors that will likely impact their results.We expect Texas Instruments' fourth-quarter earnings to be driven by strength in several higher-margin and high-growth market areas. The company's expanding exposure in industrial and automotive markets should benefit the upcoming results.Also, the analog segment should have performed well during the quarter, driven by TI's compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output.However, sluggishness in the company's embedded processing unit due to weak performing processors remains a concern and may continue to impact its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. This segment was down 4% year over year in the las  ed quarter as well, owing to weak performance of processors and sluggishness in the communications equipment market.Also, rising competition, particularly in auto chips, is currently a major headwind for Texas Instruments. | We expect strength across majority of the end markets to drive Xilinx's fiscal third-quarter results. Solid performances of Communications businesses, as well as broad-based growth at Data Center, Testing, Measurement, and Emulation (TME) plus Industrial segments are likely to act as catalysts.Also, the wireless business should continue to benefit from LTE upgrades and the early deployment of 5G, thereby expanding its top-line growth.However, increasing operating expenses of the company due to higher employee compensation, including profit sharing and sales incentive, might impact profits in the quarter to be reported.In addition, the full integration of DeePhi acquisition will likely be an overhang on its margins in the quarter. Additionally, intensifying competition from Intel is a negative for Xilinx and may impact its bottom line.

ilinx (XLNX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when i  s results for the quarter ended December 2018. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This computer chipmaker is expected to pos  of $0.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.8%.Revenues are expected to be $770.84 million, up 22.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Xilinx, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xilinx will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xilinx would pos  of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of +16%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xilinx doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"rtificial intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming a bigger part of our lives. From self-driving cars to interactions with virtual assistants and simple searches on the internet, you can be assured that there's an AI algorithm working in the background to come up with the best results.It is well-known that  is driving innovation in self-driving cars and  in the cloud, but a few smaller companies are using AI as a springboard for their growth and investors could benefit from taking a look. (NASDAQ: XLNX) and  (NYSE: CIEN) , for instance, provide the infrastructure that's critical to the deployment of AI. Not surprisingly, both companies delivered solid gains last year, and they won't be hitting the pause button anytime soon. data by NVIDIA has been making waves in AI thanks to its graphics cards, which are considered  AI models as they can process huge sets of data thanks to the presence of hundreds of cores. But Xilinx's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) -- chips that can be reprogrammed for specific tasks after manufacturing -- are considered ideal for the real-world deployment of AI models because of their flexibility and low power consumption.Image source: Getty Images.Developers can reprogram Xilinx's FPGAs to deploy or fine-tune AI applications, making these chips ideal for the inferencing phase that requires fewer data center resources as compared to the training phase. That's one of the reasons the FPGA market is expected to clock robust growth in the coming years, hitting revenue of $12.1 billion by 2024, as compared to $6.9 billion in 2016, according to one estimate.Major cloud providers are already offering FPGA-based servers on their cloud computing platforms.  (NYSE: BABA) , for instance, is using Xilinx's FPGAs to accelerate cloud computing workloads. The choice has turned out to be beneficial for Alibaba, as it has managed to reduce costs by 40% while tackling huge and diverse workloads.Xilinx's chips played an important role in Alibaba's ""Singles Day"" shopping event in November last year, providing more than 45 billion personalized shopping recommendations to consumers based on their histories. Such benefits are the reason Microsoft has reportedly decided to use Xilinx's solutions for more than half its Azure cloud servers at the expense of  's FPGAs.Cloud computing leader  is also a Xilinx customer and is expanding its FPGA-based servers to more regions across the globe. So it's safe to say that the chipmaker is on track to take advantage of the FPGA opportunity in data centers because of its partnerships with the major players in this space.In fact, Xilinx is the best means of taking advantage of FPGA growth because it commands 58% of this market and has been growing at a faster pace than archrival Intel. Xilinx's revenue shot up 19% annually during the las  ed quarter, driven by a 28% increase in the data center business. Intel's competing programmable chip business, on the other hand, saw an increase of just 6%.It isn't just cars, movie streaming apps, and home devices that are reaping the benefits of artificial intelligence. At its core, AI is technologies that can run autonomously, and those can apply to something as boring as networking infrastructure.For instance, if you have two devices at your office that run on the same network, they might not need the same speed or bandwidth at all times. An intelligent network will be capable of deciding which device needs more bandwidth and operate accordingly. This is where Ciena steps in with WaveLogic Ai, giving operators access to real-time monitoring solutions so they can boost their network's capacity and efficiency.This is a lucrative market to be in, as demand for intelligent networks is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 28% through 2024, according to Zion Market Research. The firm believes that this market was worth just $1.89 billion in 2017, but will grow to $10.87 billion at the end of the forecast period.So the optical networking specialist is currently standing at the threshold of opportunity. Ciena is in prime position to take advantage of the proliferation of AI in networking, as it is the leading vendor of optical networking solutions, according to IHS Markit. But the company isn't leaving anything to chance, which is why it is busy bolstering its networking automation business.Ciena recently acquired DonRiver to boost the capabilities of its software and services portfolio, formally known as Blue Planet. The acquisition will complement Blue Planet's existing offerings and allow Ciena customers to better monitor the different networking elements across a network.Thanks to such moves, Ciena aims to boost its Blue Planet automation software and services revenue to between $100 million and $120 million in the next couple of years. That would be a massive jump from the segment's current annual revenue run rate of around $40 million.In all, Ciena is pulling the right strings to tap into the AI opportunity, and the move has reaped rich results so far. The company's revenue increased nearly 21% year over year during the last reported quarter, a trend that should continue in the long run thanks to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.Xilinx and Ciena are leaders in their respective fields, which is why they are in a solid position to capitalize on the growing need for AI-enabled solutions that they provide. That's why both companies should be able to maintain their impressive growth rates, making them ideal bets for investors looking for under-the-radar AI stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Ciena wasn't one of them!

"ike every year, 2019's Customer Electronics Show (CES) has also been power packed with announcements on self-driving technologies by various tech giants.At the event,  also announced that it is partnering with French chipmaker Kalray to develop a central computing platform, which will cater to the safety and commercial needs of vehicles of levels 2 and 3 autonomy.NXP's safety products for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and Central Compute will be integrated with Kalray's high-performance intelligent MPPA (Massively Parallel Processor Array) processors. The platform will include roadmaps and development for level 4 and 5 cars.NXP's technology displays at CES 2019 were impressive with demonstrations in the key categories of autonomous vehicles - Connectivity, ADAS, Powertrain & Vehicle Dynamics, Body & Comfort and Connected Infotainment.CES 2019 also witnessed demonstrations from NXP for security embedded in CAN transceivers, the use of ultra-wideband for car keyless entry connectivity, new car radio tuners and ADAS, among others.NXP seems to be well positioned to capitalize on the level 2-5 automotive market, which, even being quite a small fraction of the total market, is expected to see meaningful growth in a couple of years.Per Technavio, the global autonomous vehicles market is expected to witness a CAGR of 41.61% during 2018-2022. Moreover, per MarketsandMarkets, the ADAS market is projected to reach $91.83 billion by 2025, reflecting a CAGR of 20.96% between 2018 and 2025.These predictions spell good news for NXP, which enjoys approximately 12.5% share in the automotive semiconductor market (based on a 2017 TAM of $34.5 billion). It is the largest player in the automotive semiconductor market worldwide, followed by competitor Infineon Technologies.With growing momentum of the autonomous vehicle-related industries, more and more companies are upping their efforts in these areas.Micron  announced at CES 2019 that its memory solutions will be adopted by Mobileye to develop a system-on-chip-based platform required for fully autonomous driving, which will function as the central sensor and performance control of its fully autonomous driving vehicles.Micron also partnered with Qualcomm to jointly develop advanced solutions for in-vehicle cockpit controls in autonomous vehicles. It seems that Micron is strategically placing itself to cash in on the opportunities provided by the autonomous vehicle and related markets.Furthermore, NVIDIA  announced at the tradeshow that it has extended its partnership with Mercedes-Benz, to build AI architecture for Mercedes-Benz cars, which will enable a single system to provide self-driving capabilities and smart-cockpit functions. The company also unveiled the world's first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system - Drive AutoPilot - in the show, further intensifying competition.Also, Xilinx  recently collaborated with driveline and chassis technology supplier - ZF Friedrichshafen AG (""ZF"") - to power the new ZF ProAI automotive control unit, highlighting the fact that its technology for self-driving is also gaining traction.However, with its technological expertise and foothold in the autonomous vehicle, ADAS and automotive semiconductor market, NXP seems to be well equipped to withstand the competition.NXP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"s many may have observed, the semiconductor space sold off hard over the past six months. The simmering trade dispute with China, combined with fears of slowing global growth, has put the sustainability of the past few years' tech boom in question. Unlike software stocks that have recurring revenues thought to be somewhat immune from downturns, semiconductor businesses are often thought of like industrials, which are heavily tied to the business cycle.And yet programmable chipmaker  (NASDAQ: XLNX) has defied the recent semi swoon. The stock is up a whopping 30% on the year as of this writing, while the semiconductor sector has fallen deep into negative territory. data by So what is Xilinx doing right, and should you add the chipmaker to your portfolio?Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx makes programmable logic devices (PLDs) that help route workloads between processors and memory on integrated chips. Unlike custom chips, PLDs can be programmed by customers via software to fit their specific applications. This is in contrast to application-specific integrated chips (ASICs) and application-specific standard products (ASSPs). In general, PLDs are more flexible and offer faster time-to-market, with much less upfront investment. ASICs, on the other hand, typically offer higher performance in smaller form factors, but have high upfront costs and little to no flexibility in how they're used.One of the reasons for optimism around Xilinx is that PLDs could start to take a larger share from ASICs and ASSPs in the future. As PLDs become smaller and technology improves, the PLDs could potentially become more attractive relative to ASICS. Furthermore, the upfront costs of designing one's own ASIC is rising as technology challenges become harder.Like the move to heavier use of open-source software vs. customized (and expensive) proprietary software, PLDs have come more into fashion versus custom chips due to their agility and relatively low upfront costs. Improving quality of PLDs is also making them more competitive with ASICs on high-volume applications.A quick glance at Xilinx's financials might make you wonder why the market is so bullish. The company trades at an expensive-looking  of 38 and that drops to 26 when using earnings estimates. While last quarter's growth of 18.9% was quite good, a valuation that high would tend to forecast even stronger growth, or the sustainability of a mid-to-high-teens growth rate over a long period.The answer, I think, lies in the growth of Xilinx's newest ""advanced"" products -- namely, its new Ultrascale+ family of products introduced over the past few years, especially the Zync Ultrascale model. These advanced products are quickly catching on, and displacing the use of Xilinx's older core products.
  
Data source: Xilinx FY Q2 2019 press release.As you can see, advanced products are grew at a staggering 43% clip in the most recent quarter, far outpacing the overall company growth. Advanced products now make up about two-thirds of Xilinx's revenue, as opposed to just about half the mix one year ago. As that higher-growth segment makes up more and more of the business, Xilinx's growth should maintain its high levels, and even potentially accelerate.Finally, the market is forward-looking, which means  and opportunities are also boosting Xilinx.One exciting new product is the company's 7nm Versal ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform). This new product will not just be software-programmable like Xilinx's previous chips, but can also be altered at the hardware level. The company just announced the Versal ACAP product last quarter, which management called ""the most profound recent milestone by far ... this is a new product category that goes far beyond the capabilities of [field programmable gate arrays].""In addition to new products, Xilinx also inked some impressive wins with major customers recently. At the end of October Xilinx won a big contract from cloud giant  over Xilinx's main competitor, Altera, which was purchased by  in 2015.New customer wins like these and new products like the ACAP are likely to keep investor enthusiasm for Xilinx high versus competitors -- barring a recession, of course.As cloud computing and 5G come online over the next view years, the PLD market, and Xilinx specifically, should benefit strongly. Xilinx seems to be winning this sector at the moment, and could be a strong pick over the next few years as exciting new tech applications for PLDs come online.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them!

" recently collaborated with driveline and chassis technology supplier - ZF Friedrichshafen AG (""ZF"") - to power the new ZF ProAI automotive control unit.The new control unit, ZF ProAI, will run on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ microprocessor system-on-chips (MPSoC) platform, which will overlook the aggregation, pre-processing and distribution of real-time data, and accelerate the artificial intelligence (AI) processing of the unit.The collaboration of Xilinx and ZF reflects the growing adoption of the Zynq platform. ZF opted for the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform for the high scalability and flexibility it provides to the processing power.Xilinx is riding on the growing traction witnessed by its Zynq portfolio. In November last year, Zynq UltraScale+ family of MPSoC was deemed Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 3, HFT1 capable, per IEC 61508 functional-safety specification of Exida Functional Safety Certification Authority.This certification wasthe green signal for developers to use the MPSoC platform in AI-based safety-critical applications of up to SIL 3.The Zynq portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting the company to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel  . The company has started shipping the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product, which offers superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology.The company's Zynq portfolio recorded solid top-line growth in second-quarter fiscal 2019.Revenues from the company's Zynq products surged 70% year over year, driven by robust demand in automotive mostly advanced driver assist systems, industrial and communications markets. The platform contributed 18% of total revenues. | Xilinx's UltraScale families feature multiple nodes from planar through FinFET technologies. The UltraScale+ architecture also includes the Ultrascale+ FPGAs, which has considerable demand among data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS). This makes us optimistic about its prospects.Amazon  was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FaaS last year. The company's leadership position in China market with regard to FaaS expanded with Alibaba  moving from beta to general access.Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $85.73, changing hands for $86.85/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $72.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $110.00. The standard deviation is $11.731.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $85.73/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $85.73 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

"Chicago, IL - December 14, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article are: Verint Systems Inc.  , Integer Holdings Corporation  , AMN Healthcare Services Inc  , Xilinx, Inc.  and United States Cellular Corporation  .A 52-week high generally works as an indicator for investors, as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Notably, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced, considering the high price level. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an imminent decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

s 2018 comes to a close, we believe, this is the apt time to make your investment plans for the upcoming year.A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks with solid prospects and selling off those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we will discuss the performance of Xilinx  , a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.5% and a  of B. Notably, the company has returned approximately 26.4% this year, outperforming the  growth of 17.6% and the S&P 500 Composite's decline of 12%.We note that the company delivered a positive surprise of 8.74% in the trailing four reported quarters. This apart, an encouraging outlook provided during the last quarterly  also makes us optimistic about the stock's near-term performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings of $3.29 has remained stable in the past 30 days.Xilinx is benefiting from growth across majority of the end markets. Solid performances of its Data Center and TME, Industrial, Aerospace and Defense and Communications businesses are buoying investor confidence in the company's near-term prospects.Growth in wireless and wired businesses owing to LTE upgrades, early deployment of 5G in Korea and preparation for 5G deployment in both China and North America augur well for the company.Moreover, Xilinx's ongoing transition from a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping it gain a potent market share and counter stiff competition from the likes of Intel  .We are optimistic about the surge in demand for Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGAs among data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS). Amazon  was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FaaS in May 2017. On the last , management mentioned that Amazon Web Services doubled its FaaS availability zones to 8. Moreover, the company's leadership position in the Chinese market with regard to FaaS expanded with Alibaba  moving from beta to general access.Xilinx's string of successful product portfolio also looks impressive. Significantly, the company's first and second generation Zynq products hit a new sales record in the last reported quarter, growing 76% year over year, driven by robust demand in the automotive, industrial, communications and data center markets.It is important to note that Xilinx unveiled Alveo, a suite of accelerator cards, aimed at enhancing the performance level and productivity of industry-standard servers across cloud and on-premise data centers. Recently, the company expanded its Alveo portfolio with Alveo U280 high bandwidth memory accelerator card. The company expects Alveo revenues to start improving from the second half of fiscal 2019 and be a significant driver in the year after.Therefore, we consider Xilinx to be a profitable technology stock, which investors should keep in their portfolios. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

" recently acquired SensiML Corporation in an all-stock deal. Notably, SensiML will continue its operations as a separate division of QuickLogic. However, financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps.The buyout is anticipated to empower QuickLogic's product portfolio with machine-learning (ML) tools required to devise embedded algorithms.Notably, the integrated algorithms enhance performance of microcontrollers (MCUs) and SoCs (system-on-a-chip microchips). These MCUs and SoCs find ample application in smart edge computing devices.SensiML's focus on commercialization and development of SaaS-based ML tool suite, SensiML Analytics Toolkit utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) driven automation methods is commendable. The Toolkit's strength in offering sturdy integrated algorithms to support Internet of Things (IoT) based MCUs and SoCs is a key catalyst.QuickLogic offers sensor processing solutions including FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) as part of hardware products and software-based algorithm solutions. The company's business complements that of SensiML, which is a positive.In this regard, management is optimistic about the cross-leverage opportunity to integrate SensiML software suite with QuickLogic eFPGA IP and QuickAI platform.Notably, SensiML will continue to support third-party SoCs apart from that of QuickLogic's SoCs and other solutions. Management anticipates positive EBITDA for SensiML unit in fiscal 2019.Following the news, shares of QuickLogic increased 7.3%, with the stock price closing at approximately 91 cents in the last trading session. QuikLogic stock has lost 52.3% in the past year compared with  's 12.9% decline.SensiML team was formerly a software group of Intel  . The founders of SensiML acquired the Intel Knowledge Builder IP technology to form an independent company in 2017.In fact, Knowledge Builder Toolkit offered support to Intel's Curie and Quark SE MCUs, the first commercially available MCUs to incorporate robust ML accelerator technology.With an aim to reduce power consumption, the SensiML Analytics Toolkit automates optimization of AI models by utilizing eFPGA technology and heterogeneous multi-core SoC infrastructure.SensiML Analytics Toolkit currently supports QuickLogic's latest QuickAI Platform, Intel's Atom MCUs, Arm Cortex SoCs, among others. The Toolkit also supports QuickLogic EOSAI, which management anticipates unveiling shortly.We believe the acquisition of comprehensive AI-driven SaaS platform will enable QuickLogic to offer sturdy edge AI platform solutions. With the enhanced embedded algorithms, the company is anticipated to benefit from rapid adoptionof its product portfolio, primarily the new QuickAI platform, EoS sensor processors and ArcticPro eFPGA IP, among others.Further, the buyout is expected to aid the company in expanding its TAM with the SaaS revenue business.With the buyout, QuickLogic attempts to provide a comprehensive practicalsolution in a bid to explore emerging markets, including AIin edge computing and IoT endpoint devices.Notably, per ResearchAndMarkets report, ""global AI in embedded IoT devices market"" is anticipated to advance to nearly $26.2 billion by 2023. Moreover, the report predicts that by 2023, semiconductors and embedded devices exceeding 87 billion units ""will be shipped in support of IoT"".Meanwhile, QuickLogic's strength in smartphone market and increasing demand for wearable products in the B2B market bode well. Furthermore, the company is working with a Japanese smartphone OEM, which is expected to adopt QuickLogic's EOS S3 SoC for its new models scheduled to be launched in 2020.We believe the buyout of SensiML positions QuickLogic well to capitalize on the aforementioned growth prospects.However, consolidating semiconductor market and stiff competition from notable eFPGA chip makers, including Intel, Xilinx  among others, is concerning.Additionally, QuickLogic's eFPGA and SoC development, and enhancement efforts to stay afloat in the competitive market are resulting in higher capital expenditures, which remain an overhang on margin expansion.QuickLogic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which might change given the latest positive development.Upland Software  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a stock worth considering in the broader technology sector. You can see  .Long-term earnings growth rate for Upland Software is currently pegged at 20%.The greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

lobal semiconductor sales reached $41.8 billion in October, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). The trade war has been taking a toll on chipmakers and other technology stocks. However, despite recurrent tensions, semiconductor sales continue to rise.Moreover, a trade truce between the United States and China following the White House's declaration of a 90-day moratorium on raising tariffs on Chinese goods sent chipmaker stocks higher earlier this week. Chip stocks have been largely responsible for the long-running market rally. And with global semiconductor sales increasing once again in October, it makes semiconductor stocks must haves for your portfolio.On Dec 3, the Semiconductor Industry Association announced that global sales of semiconductors reached $41.8 billion in October, reflecting a 12.7% and 1% year-over-year and monthly increase, respectively. Global semiconductor sales came in at $41.4 billion in September. Regionally, year-over-year sales jumped 23.3% in China, followed by 14.1% in the Americas and 7% in Europe.Moreover, World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) industry forecast has been revised upward. The SIA endorsed the WSTS Autumn 2018 global report, which projects worldwide sales of semiconductors to reach $477.9 billion in 2018. This will also mark the industry's highest-ever annual sales, increasing 15.9% from the 2017 figure of $412.2 billion. Also, the annual global semiconductor market is projected to grow 2.6% in 2019.The trade dispute between the United States and China has been weighing on markets for a while now. This has resulted in chipmaker stocks suffering time and again. However, a trade truce between the United States and China, following the White House's declaration of a 90-day moratorium on raising tariffs on Chinese imports, saw chipmaker stocks bouncing back earlier this week.Over the weekend, the White House issued a statement saying that the United States would hold back on increasing tariffs on Chinese imports for 90 days, as both the countries start working on a possible resolution to the trade dispute. This gave investors the much-needed confidence, thereby driving chip stocks.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, while China is its biggest market. Trade war fears have definitely dented investors' confidence but chip stocks are not as susceptible to trade war as industrials. Also, China's limitations in building its own technology industry might restrict it from acting against U.S.-based players.Given the robust demand for semiconductors and an increase in global semiconductor sales once again in October, the recent fears may be overblown. This is why picking semiconductor stocks still looks like a smart option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics. is a market-leading innovator and manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products by significantly increasing their energy performance and efficiency.Cree sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

"Chicago, IL - November 29, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include: United States Cellular Corp.  , The Mosaic Company  , Moog Inc.  , Xilinx, Inc.  and Popular, Inc.  .A 52-week high level is used as an indicator, as stocks near that level are considered winners.Investors often wonder if the high price range has made the stock overpriced. While such apprehensions are not completely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.A particular strategy advises investors to gamble on stocks that have scaled 52-week highs. This is fairly a new approach in the investing rulebook. Borrowing from the basics of Momentum investing, this technique bets on the principle of buying high and selling higher.Though skeptics may raise a brow on the mettle of this 52-week high investment strategy, we believe that this, when clubbed with the right set of parameters, will help rack up sizable gains. A wide group of investors today favor winning stocks with prospects of scaling higher. These investors have mastered the art of finding stocks that have strong upside potential and are still undervalued.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.And that's what we're screening for today…Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

he broader semiconductor market is in shambles right now, but that didn't stop  (NASDAQ: XLNX) from reporting terrific fiscal second-quarter results that  by a mile. The results convinced investors that the programmable chip specialist is riding on solid catalysts strong enough to help it navigate the short-term hiccups in the semiconductor industry.This point was driven home by Xilinx's third-quarter outlook, which calls for a 22% annual jump in the company's top line, to $770 million. For comparison, Wall Street was expecting guidance of just $720 million.The fact that Xilinx has now stepped on the gas doesn't seem entirely surprising. The company has been  to corner a bigger share of the massive artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity, and it won't be stopping anytime soon. Here's why.Image Source: Getty Images.Xilinx's communications and data center businesses showed remarkable growth last quarter. Its communications revenue shot up 33% annually thanks to the beginning of  deployments. Xilinx pointed out on the latest  that it has moved from the prototyping phase to the early production phase of 5G-centric chips.Xilinx started introducing 5G chip platforms over a year ago in a bid to stay on top of this emerging technology trend. The company integrated 5G functionality into its Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC chip family in October of last year, making samples available to customers as part of an early access program. Now Xilinx's early move into this market is paying off, as it seems to be converting those early access customers into actual clients.More importantly, Xilinx is now in a solid position to take advantage of the impending 5G boom, with some estimates putting the number of 5G connections at more than 1 billion by 2023. That would create the need for more 5G infrastructure and push up demand for Xilinx's programmable chips aimed at this market.Meanwhile, the company's data center business is also displaying remarkable growth. Revenue from this segment was up 28% year over year in the latest quarter, making it Xilinx's second-fastest-growing business. The chipmaker attributes this rapid growth to the increasing adoption of its field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) across various data center verticals such as storage and computing. , for instance, is using Xilinx's programmable chips in its smart solid-state drive (SSD) product for boosting computing speeds in the data center. This paves the way for Xilinx to take advantage of yet another fast-growing space. SSDs are expected to take over data center storage going forward, as they occupy less real estate and are faster than traditional storage drives. That's how they bring down the operating costs of a data center.On the other hand, major cloud service providers continue to deploy Xilinx's programmable chips in their data centers to accelerate workloads.  and  were the early adopters of Xilinx's FPGAs in the data center, and they are now expanding the availability of those FPGA-powered servers across more regions.Amazon, for instance, has doubled the deployment of Xilinx's FPGA-powered cloud computing servers from four zones to eight. In China, Alibaba and Huawei have already announced the general availability of cloud servers based on Xilinx's programmable chips. What's more, the company is now looking to push the envelope further in data centers with a new range of accelerator cards that'll boost performance across several AI applications.The best part is that Xilinx's data center momentum is just getting started; deployment of FPGAs  , as they are better at handling certain AI tasks than other chips. This is one of the reasons FPGA sales are expected to exceed $12 billion by 2024, compared to less than $7 billion in 2016.Now that Xilinx commands around 60% of the FPGA market and is looking to steal a march on its nearest rival with  , it is in pole position to tap into this opportunity.The catalysts discussed above are just some of the reasons investors should consider going long Xilinx. A closer look at the company reveals a few more reasons this chipmaker could turn out to be a solid long-term bet.For instance, Xilinx has  (1.7%) when compared to the overall tech sector's average, and it has the potential to raise its dividend now that its growth has picked up pace. The jump in the company's top and bottom lines last quarter led to a strong increase in free cash flow. data by Looking ahead, Xilinx's free cash flow profile should keep getting better, as the catalysts discussed above will lead to a stronger bottom line. Analysts estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance are that earnings will increase at an annual pace of more than 17% over the next five years, which is way better than the 4% annual earnings growth it has clocked over the last five.This paves the way for stronger dividend growth. So Xilinx investors will not only benefit from the growth of emerging tech trends such as artificial intelligence and 5G, but also stand to gain from a potential increase in the dividend. This makes Xilinx a solid semiconductor bet given that it trades at 22 times next year's earnings, as it is only slightly more expensive than the industry average price-to-earnings ratio of just over 19.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Xilinx wasn't one of them!

"Chicago, IL - November 13, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article are  ,  ,  ,  and  .A company is expected to enjoy a high level of profitability when it can offer strong returns after all its operating and non-operating costs. The best possible way to evaluate the profitability position of a company is to use financial ratios. In this context, ratio analysis is used to differentiate a profitable company from a loss-making one.Generally, there are four key profitability ratios - gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. Here, we have used the most effective and frequently used profitability ratio - net income ratio.Net income ratio gives us the exact profit level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total sales revenues. Using net income ratio, one can determine a company's capability to meet operating and non-operating expenses with its sales revenues. A higher net income ratio usually implies a company's ability to generate ample sales revenues and successfully manage all business functions.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the ""#1 site for screening stocks"" by Money Magazine.

" 52-week high level generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.More often than not, investors wonder if the high price range has made the stock overpriced. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.The lower, the better.This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see  .This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 26 stocks that made it through the screen:United States Cellular Corporation  is a Chicago, IL-based company, which provides wireless service coverage for Telephone and Data Systems in select Midwest markets. The company caters to both retail consumers and business customers, offering a wide range of products and services. It is one ofthe largest wireless telecom operators in the United States.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of SOXX, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, SOXX's low point in its 52 week range is $151.58 per share, with $198.84 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $163.92. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Inflow Detected - SOXX, INTC, XLNX, TSM@2018-11-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-inflow-detected-soxx-intc-xlnx-tsm-2018-11-05

 lower-than-expected top and bottom-line results left it tremendously stressed ever since its quarterly earnings release on Nov 15.Moreover, the company's weak near-term guidance dealt a severe blow to investor confidence. Notably, shares of NVIDIA have lost 26.4% since its earnings announcement, thereby wiping out more than $25 billion of investor wealth.Further, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock is currently one of the worst performers, lagging the S&P 500 index and the industry it belongs to over the past year.Shares of NVIDIA have plunged 31% in the past year compared with the  9% decline. The loss is also against the S&P 500 Composite's 1.6% increase.NVIDIA's results were marred by a sluggish Gaming segment, affected by an excess inventory of midrange Pascal products. Notably, inventory level of midrange Pascal gaming cards remained higher-than-expected as demand from gamers failed to grow rapidly to offset the soft cryptocurrency-related requirement. Consequently, shipment was badly hurt as the price of graphic cards is still elevated.On the , management mentioned that it will take a couple of quarters to normalize the channel inventory. As the company plans to lower its excess channel inventories, it announced suspension of mid-range Pascal GPU shipments. Notably, the company's mid-range desktop portfolio constitutes nearly one-third of its gaming business.Moreover, in the fiscal fourth quarter, NVIDIA anticipates soft sales of Tegra chips for game consoles on account of normal seasonal build cycle, to weigh on its gaming revenues. All these impelled the management to issue a tepid guidance for the period.Additionally, although the company is witnessing growth in its datacenter business, the growth rate seems to have waned from the previous levels.Given the circumstances that NVIDIA is currently in, it advisable for investors to steer clear of the stock.Although NVIDIA's prospects may not seem appealing at the moment, there are some semiconductor stocks that hold great promise.Zacks' proprietary methodology comes in handy while zeroing in on these stocks. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  of A or B when combined with a favourable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer good investment bets.

Once upon a time, chipmaker  (NASDAQ:  ) was the hottest stock in the market. That time wasn't too long ago. From April to September 2018, AMD stock nearly quadrupled from $9 to $36.Everyone thought that AMD had cracked the code in its fight with  (NASDAQ:  ), and was going to steal significant market share over the next several quarters. FOMO (fear of missing out) kicked in, buyers rushed to the stock, shorts covered, and analysts upgraded.Then, reality hit.AMD reported third quarter numbers in October that, while good, didn't support the huge rally the stock had staged from $9 to $36. Earnings topped expectations. Revenues missed. The guide was weak. And, next to AMD's weak results, Intel reported really strong third quarter numbers.Overall, recent results imply that while AMD is still doing well, the company isn't stealing market share left and right, and Intel still remains king in critical secular growth markets.AMD stock dropped. From a $35-plus high in September to $16 in late October.That was a  . In the mid-teens, AMD stock was undervalued considering its secular growth prospects through AI, IoT, and data-centers. But, now that the stock has bounced back to levels above $20, I think caution is warranted. Fundamentals imply $20 is a fair 2018 price target for this stock, while levels above $20 seem fundamentally stretched.In the  environment, fundamentally stretched valuations are unsustainable. As such, for the foreseeable future, AMD looks like a stock you buy on big dips below $20, and sell on rallies back to $20.AMD stock is supported by healthy long-term growth fundamentals. But, those fundamentals aren't as robust as investors buying at $30 had hoped.When AMD was trading above $30, investors were hoping that new products would spark AMD to rapidly steal market share from Intel. Specifically, the hope was that new EPYC chips would steal share from Intel in the secular growth data-center market.This is happening. But, not quite at the robust rate investors were hoping for when AMD was $30. During the past quarter EPYC won major cloud contract deals with  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Those are some nice additions. But, data-center GPU sales rose at just a double-digit rate during that quarter. That is good, but not great. By comparison, Intel's data-center revenues rose 26% last quarter.Thus, it is safe to say that Intel's data-center business and AMD's data-center business grew at similar rates last quarter. That doesn't imply robust market share expansion for AMD. It implies that both AMD and Intel are growing side-by-side in the secular growth data-center market.This is how things will persist for the foreseeable future. AMD will be characterized by gradual share expansion in secular growth markets. But, hopes and dreams of huge market share expansion for AMD are just that: hopes and dreams.As such, AMD stock is supported by good fundamentals. Secular tailwinds in the AI, IoT, and data-center markets support healthy revenue and profit growth at AMD, But, they won't catalyze huge revenue growth, and they won't push the stock back to $30 any time soon.Roughly speaking, the  has gone from $10 billion in revenue per month in 1996 to $40 billion in revenue per month today.That represents a trailing, 22-year compounded annual growth rate of roughly 6.5%. Secular trends in cloud migration, IoT development, AI improvements, and smartphone proliferation support healthier-than-usual adoption rates going forward for GPUs, CPUs, and all semiconductor equipment.Thus, over the next several years, I think it is reasonable to project 10% annual revenue growth for the global semiconductor market.Given AMD's new line of products and the successful ramp of these products, I think it's also reasonable to assume that AMD's market share will gradually expand over the next several years. Thus, if the global semiconductor market grows at a 10% annual rate over the next five years, I think it's reasonable to estimate that AMD's annual revenue growth rate can reach 15% - 20%.During that stretch, AMD's gross margins should continue to improve thanks to higher average sales prices and entry into higher-margin markets, while double-digit revenue growth should drive healthy operating expense leverage. All together, then, AMD will be a company with 15%-plus revenue growth potential on top of healthy margin expansion potential over the next several years.These reasonable growth assumptions give visibility to EPS of $1.50 by fiscal 2023. After placing a forward price-earnings multiple of 20 on AMD, which is average for growth stocks, and discounting back by 10% per year, we are looking at a fiscal 2018 price target of just over $20.In today's market, fundamentally stretched valuations are unsustainable given global growth concerns. Thus, AMD stock is a buy on big dips below $20, and a sell on rallies above $20.AMD hit a brick wall called reality in October, and shares have appropriately normalized lower ever since. But, this stock still has tremendous long-term growth prospects, and those growth prospects support a $20 price tag for the stock.Dips below this level are buying opportunities. Rallies above it are selling opportunities.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Stay Away from AMD Stock Above $20, but Buy It Below That for Sure@2018-11-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stay-away-amd-stock-above-20-buy-it-below-sure-2018-11-05
"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $83.33, changing hands for $85.37/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $72.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $100.00. The standard deviation is $8.465.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $83.33/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $83.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Skyworks is at the top of this list and it won't be surprising if its margins get better on account of favorable technology trends in smartphones and the Internet of Things.Carrier aggregation -- which increases bandwidth -- for instance, will give Skyworks' business a nice shot in the arm as it supplies necessary technology.Looking ahead, demand for Skyworks' aggregation switches will increase with the advent of  cellular networks. That's because 5G networks require the aggregation of a wide range of spectrum bands from 30 GHz to 300 GHz as compared to the 4G network that uses frequencies below 6 GHz.Considering that 5G smartphone shipments are forecast to increase from just 2 million in 2019 to 1.5 billion in 2025, it can be safely said that Skyworks Solutions is sitting on a massive opportunity.Just like Skyworks, demand for Xilinx's programmable chips is going to take off thanks to their  (AI). It is estimated that the market for FPGA (field-programmable gate array) chips that Xilinx deals in will be worth $12.1 billion in 2024 as compared to $6.9 billion at the end of 2016.Xilinx is in a solid position to take advantage of this growth, as it controls nearly 60% of the FPGA market.  holds the remaining market share in this space, and it is likely that it could lose more ground because of a delay in its 10-nm (nanometer) production process. Xilinx is all set to launch its next-generation FPGAs based on the  , while Intel's competing 10-nm platform will probably  , assuming that there are no further delays.Ideally, Xilinx's chips based on a smaller manufacturing node should give it a leg up over Intel. That's because a smaller nanometer indicates that the chip is made using an advanced process, which allows for more processing power and lower power consumption. As such, Xilinx can widen its technology lead over Chipzilla, as the latter will remain on the 14-nm manufacturing process for at least two years.In all, Xilinx looks set to corner a bigger share of the FPGA market. This is one of the reasons why the company's earnings are forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16% over the next five years. This marks a terrific improvement over the 4% annual earnings growth that Xilinx has recorded in the past five years.Maxim Integrated has managed to get its growth back on track of late thanks to  its automotive business. Its revenue increased 8% in the recently concluded fiscal year, which marks an improvement over the 5% annual revenue growth it clocked in fiscal 2017. The good news is that Maxim believes that its automotive business will grow in the low teens going forward.The automotive business supplied 22%, or $139 million, of Maxim's total revenue during the quarter ended in June. This translates into an annual automotive run rate of $556 million. Using a 13% growth rate (the company's low-teens estimate), Maxim's annual automotive revenue could exceed $1 billion in the next five years, nearly double where it stands right now. Given that Maxim has generated $2.48 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months, the automotive business looks all set to give its figures a nice boost in the future.More importantly, Maxim is in a solid position to grow the automotive business thanks to its partnerships with the likes of  . Maxim's integrated circuits have been chosen by NVIDIA to power its advanced self-driving car systems, including the DRIVE Pegasus and the Xavier platforms.The good news for Maxim is that NVIDIA's autonomous driving platforms are witnessing higher engagement levels thanks to its solid ecosystem of partners. Maxim's long-term prospects appear rosy.In the end, we can conclude that all three companies could deliver nice gains to investors in the long run despite short-term hiccups, thanks to their reliance on secular growth trends. That's why investors should hold tight and possibly accumulate these three stocks if they show signs of short-term weakness.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Edge MSCI USA Size Factor ETF (Symbol: SIZE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $95.92 per unit.With SIZE trading at a recent price near $81.23 per unit, that means that analysts see 18.08% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SIZE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Copart Inc (Symbol: CPRT), Trimble Inc (Symbol: TRMB), and Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX). Although CPRT has traded at a recent price of $46.33/share, the average analyst target is 22.10% higher at $56.57/share. Similarly, TRMB has 20.39% upside from the recent share price of $36.43 if the average analyst target price of $43.86/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting XLNX to reach a target price of $82.00/share, which is 18.77% above the recent price of $69.04.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Peek Under The Hood: SIZE Has 18% Upside@2018-10-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/peek-under-hood-size-has-18-upside-2018-10-25

"Traders are running away from semiconductor stocks today, as  (NASDAQ:  ) warns that demand may be ebbing. This will create an enormous opportunity for investors. TI, as it's known, said it earned $1.57 billion -  - on revenue of $4.26 billion during the third quarter of its fiscal year, handing $1.8 billion back to TXN shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.The numbers were  , but what traders wanted to talk about was  of CEO Rich Templeton, who said the company was heading into a softer market, that demand was slowing. Anyone who knows trade should have expected this. American chips and designs have long crossed the Pacific to be turned into low-cost PCs and devices by Asian manufacturers for a grateful world. The Trump trade war threatens to interrupt this profitable trade.The trade war may be the dumbest global conflict to break out since interlocking alliances started World War I, but hopefully, the damage can be contained this time.Besides, chip demand always ebbs and flows. It's a cyclical business. New products become mature, and, while designers think of newer products, demand can ebb, backing up supply chains. This has been true since the industry's birth in the 1960s. But while things readjust, there are bargains to be had.TI's fall of 6% in early trade Oct. 24 dropped the price-earnings (P/E) ratio of TXN stock below 22, and it's selling at just six times its last year's sales. Other chip stocks are also falling in price, like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).  (NASDAQ:  ), which is now well ahead of  (NASDAQ:  ) in manufacturing capability, is trading at levels not seen since July 2017.Few stocks have been hit as hard as  (NASDAQ:  ), now down over 40% from its May high. At under $38 per share, it is trading at just 3.3 times last year's earnings, and at just 1.3 times its 2018 revenue of $30 billion.That's because past downturns hit memory chips (commodity products with little differentiation) especially hard. Micron has been driven to the wall twice by tech recessions, but it had $6 billion in cash on the books at the end of August, and this is not the first rodeo for CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who ran Sandisk until its sale to  (NASDAQ:  ) in 2016, What's different this time for the semiconductor space? Not much. Just a supercycle in which chips start becoming standard in thousands of previously inert devices, replacing switches in thermostats and traffic lights, controlling maintenance schedules for factories and airplanes, and letting your car drive itself, among other things.This transition in computing, from something you use overtly to something built into the background of daily life, is just getting started, amid predictable hand-wringing over security and other issues. Personally, I'm looking forward to new robot overlords, knowing they'll be doing all sorts of rote work, allowing people to get on with the creative ""wet work"" we're best at.Every ebb in chip stocks leads to an opportunity for longer-term investors. Investors should let the current chip panic wash through trader accounts, and then look to pick up some bargains. I like Micron, I like TXN stock; and if you don't know what to get, the  (NYSEARCA:  ) is currently trading at its low for the year.

Image source: The Motley Fool. (NASDAQ: XLNX)Q2 2019 Oct. 24, 2018 , Good afternoon. My name is Erica and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call.All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you Mr. Poirier. You may begin. -- Thank you, Erika, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, the business outlook for the December quarter and a revised outlook for fiscal year 2019. We will then open the call for questions.Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.As we discussed in last quarter's , in addition to GAAP financial measures, we will also be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions.We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website.This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thanks Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I am very excited to report that executing on our new strategy is returning results in FY '19 that are well ahead of our original plan. We had broad strength in our business in Q2 with growth in six out of nine of our end markets.Establishing ourselves in the data center and accelerating growth in our core markets resulted in a new quarterly revenue record of $746 million, which was up 19% year-over-year and drove the non-GAAP EPS up 30% year-over-year.Given our first half FY '19 results and the continued near-term strength we see in multiple markets, we're raising our guidance for all of FY '19 to be between $2.95 billion to $3 billion. Now to be clear, we are watching the macro environment very carefully. Nonetheless, we feel this is the appropriate forward guidance.So let me share some recent business highlights. So Communications was very strong in Q2, driven by LTE upgrades, pre-5G and some early 5G deployments. Our wireless business grew very significantly with broad-based strength in both radio and baseband applications with major OEMs across multiple geographies and we resumed shipping to ZTE.Our wired business grew due to customer transitions to next generation products in several applications including OTN/Metro, Access and Data Center Interconnect.In the Data Center segment, we continue to build momentum with hyperscale companies and acceleration deployment. So for example, Twitch, a subsidiary of Amazon shared at our Developers Forum how they achieved the industry's first broadcast quality live streaming platform using a new video encoding format VP9 and all accelerated on our FPGA.Samsung announced at their Tech Day, their smart SSD product, which was the result of a yearlong collaboration between our companies. Samsung's Smart SSD combines our 60-nanometre ultrascale plus FPGA with their leadership storage technology for accelerating computing near the store data.With regard to FAS, our leadership position in China market expanded as Alibaba changed their FPGA as a service from beta access to general access. And this follows on Huawei's general access that occurred for their FAS program this past June.And recently, Amazon Web Services doubled their FAS availability zones from four to eight, adding London, Sydney, Frankfurt and most recently, China.Now continuing in terms of Data Center and our platforms, earlier this month, we announced Alveo, a portfolio of very powerful, adaptable, accelerated cards that will increase performance in industry standard servers, both in the cloud and from data centers, a very broad range of applications including AI Inference.And Alveo did ship revenue very late in Q2, but the revenue ramp really begins in the second half of FY '19. We expect revenue to grow at a good pace, but in absolute terms, it will be relatively modest for FY '19. We do expect Alveo to contribute meaningful revenue in FY '20.We also made excellent progress in our data center partnerships and ecosystem. So working with AND, we achieved an industry record for the highest AI Inference throughput performance at 30,000 images per second with less than 2 milliseconds latency, all packed in for-use server form factor with two epic CPUs and eight Alveo accelerator cards.Huawei has announced that they're integrating and deploying Alveo acceleration cards in their server product portfolio and we are collaborating together to foster an applications ecosystem in China.Inspur, a leading global data center and cloud computing solutions provider announced that they'll be qualifying two Alveo cards together with their server platforms.And on investment side, we made multiple investments last quarter in applications ecosystems, both in the data center or as well as in other markets for growth of applications and including database acceleration, mobility and next generation wireless technology.In respect to acquisitions, we did complete our acquisition of DeePhi Tech, which is an AI technology company and integration is going quite well. Their products and technology significantly strengthens our AI capabilities and what we can offer for used cases in the cloud at the edge and at end points.Now moving on to our progress overall as a platform company, our 28 and 60-nanometer zinc product families continues to grow very robustly. Zinc sales achieved a new record growing 70% from a year ago quarter and now represents 18% of sales.Growth was across a broad set of applications in the communications, automotive, mostly advanced driver assist systems and industrial end market. Our zinc RFSoC products had a revenue growth of approximately 4X versus the prior quarter's revenue and we have well over 100 unique customers at various stages of engagement. And we see our opportunity pipeline growing in double-digit percentages.And finally, the most profound recent milestone by far was our official announcement of our 7-nanometer RFSoC product family, the industry's first ACAP. ACAP product professional memory stands for adaptive compute acceleration platform and this is a new product category that goes far beyond the capabilities of FPGAs.ACAPs are adaptable, scalable and a heterogeneous compute platform that is both hardware as well as software programmable. So the RFSoC family will accelerate a very broad range of applications including AI Inference and applications that have embedded AI in them across multiple end markets and from used cases that standard cloud, to the edge and endpoints and indeed communications infrastructure that connects connects them.Versal delivers effectively the power of full custom silicon without the high cost and very long development cycles of silicon. And they could be optimized to accelerate applications on the fly and actual running systems.So we're on track to tape out the first 7-nanometer Versal product at TSMC later this quarter and we also connect to you. So in closing, I'm extremely proud of our team's excellence in innovation and consistent execution. I'm excited to see the fruits of our efforts in our Q2 results and our expectations for the full fiscal year.We continue to be deeply focused on executing our strategy for sustained, robust long-term revenue growth and shareholder value.So thank you, and now I'll turn it over Lorenzo. -- Great. Hey, thank you Victor, and good afternoon, everybody. As Victor said, we are very pleased with our business performance this quarter and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.Xilinx established several financial records and we are again in the fortunate position of increasing our guidance for FY '19. Excuse me, I will elaborate on that guidance after reviewing the quarter.Now for Q2, revenue was at an all time high of $746 million, growing 9% from last quarter and 19% year-over-year. We exceeded the high end of our guidance on the strength of our advanced products, which grew 25% over last quarter and 43% year-over-year.Victor pointed out the strength of Zynq. It grew 70% year-on-year and highlights our progress as a platform company. From an end market perspective, we saw strength from three of our four primary end markets. Data Center and TME grew significantly with both businesses contributing to the increase in sales.In communications, wired grew more than expected and wireless was particularly strong. Automotive, broadcast and consumer was stronger than expected as automotive and broadcast growth more than offset a slight decline in consumer. Industrial and A&D declined as expected with a decrease mostly in A&D.Finally Channel revenue was in line with expectations at $19 million. Note we remain below target levels of channel inventory. Gross margin was 69%, slightly below our guidance due to the strength of wireless and lower A&D in our end market mix.GAAP operating expense was $282 million and non-GAAP operating expense was $279 million, both in line with our guidance. GAAP operating income was $233 million or 31.2% and non-GAAP operating income was $236 million or 31.6%.Our tax rate was 10% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP rate was 6%. The primary difference between these rates consists of discrete items related to tax reform. Our GAAP net income was $216 million equating to $0.84 a share of earnings. Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $0.87 of earnings per share. This is a record level of earnings for Xilinx.Diluted shares for the quarter were flat at $256 million shares. There are a few key points on the balance sheet and cash flow I would like to highlight. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in gross cash, down slightly quarter-on-quarter and $1.7 billion in net debt.We generated operating cash flow $313 million due in part to reducing accounts receivable to $372 million approximately 45 days. On capital allocation, we returned $114 million to shareholders with $91 million in dividends and $23 million in share repurchase at an average price of $66.08 a share.As Victor discussed, we completed the acquisition of DeePhi in the quarter. This acquisition intended to accelerate our strategy, the dividend and our buyback, reflect the application of our capital allocation strategy as discussed at our Analyst Day.On to Q3 and our updated FY '19 guidance, we expect revenue to continue to grow with Q3 between $760 million and $780 million. We are forecasting growth in Communications, Data center and TME and Industrial and Aerospace and Defense. Particular strength is expected in Aerospace and Defense, wireless and TME. Automotive broadcast and consumer looks to come in approximately flat.Channel revenue is expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. In Q3, our gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% and GAAP operating expense in the range of $295 million. We expect non-GAAP operating expense to be approximately $290 million.The increase quarter-to-quarter in operating expense is related to increases in employee compensation, including profit sharing and sales incentives and the full integration of the DeePhi acquisition. Other income will be approximately $5 million and our tax rate is expected to be between 10% and 12%.For the full-year FY '19 forecast, we are now expecting our revenue to be between $2.950 billion and $3 billion. At the midpoint, this would be 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Gross margins for the year is expected to be between 69% and 70%. GAAP operating expense for the year is expected to be approximately $1.155 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses expected to be approximately $1.140 billion.GAAP other income for the year will be approximately $15 million of income and non-GAAP other income will be approximately $5 million of income. Our GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be between 10% and 12% and the non-GAAP rate between 9% and 11%. Share count is expected to be flat to very slightly up for the rest of the year.In summary, we expect the year to show exceptional growth in revenue and profits. We are at the initial stages of realizing the benefits of our strategy and execution and we are excited to see our opportunities developing ahead of our expectations.Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. -- This is Adam Gonzalez on for Vivek. Thanks for taking my question. My question relates to your Comments business. Just can you talk about any geographic concentration you have out there. More specifically, can you quantify your exposure to the China market and talk about the growth excluding China. And should we expect this to be the new baseline for the communications business. How sustainable are these trends as you move into 2019? Thanks. -- Well, China is an important market, but as I said in my comments that we saw growth actually with all the top customers in that segment world wide. So I would say that we're seeing growth in a number of areas although China is important.I think we have that mentioned and of course where there is maybe an acceleration of 5G deployment that in any event you know one of the areas where there's maybe an acceleration of 5G deployments happening in Korea actually.So again, while China is important, we're seeing growth actually in multiple geographies. We have consistently in the past said that we expected the really large ramp to happen 2020. It does appear that it's happening -- it's starting a bit earlierWe still believe that it'll continue to build and carry over in the pass, and of course, pass 2020, but it does appear that it's happening a bit earlier. So I think from that perspective, that's a new recent trend I suppose.And your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. -- Great. Thank you. Can you talked about the growth in zinc? Obviously, it's pretty impressive growth there. How do you see it? Are you expanding TAM or the sockets that you might not have had or you not had the zinc integration and what's your visibility on continuing this very strong ramp that you've seen in zinc? -- Yeah, Joe. I think zinc, it is very broad-based, which is -- what's so exciting about it right. As you know, this is something that we pioneer quite some time ago and I would say that in the early days it took a little bit longer and the thing that we gained from that was that there was more software work and things that took a while, but now what we're seeing is just -- we're just seeing very broad strength everywhere and certainly we do think that we are taking away from other types of solutions right; from other ASSP's, other embedded controllers.And certainly some -- we were on that Board before within FPJ perhaps or now we're capturing more of the bomb and MPS receives the second generation and the RFSoC is based on that added to it the really high performance integrated ADCs and DOCs.So we are expanding I would say, the footprint of zinc as well as the fact that the investment made back in 28-nanometers. Now, indeed most if the revenue is still 28-nanometer zinc. We've seen tremendous uptake in terms of design in the 60-nanometer, but most of the revenue for that is still in front of us. -- Great, thank you. And I guess with several of your customers at your Developer Forum and we kind of heard about the use of zinc and about specifically we heard the comment that if Xilinx had more libraries then we'd be able to use Xilinx in more applications.How do you think about that from an investment standpoint? How do you balance? It seems like there's a fairly direct tie to developing sort of more of the Xilinx generated IP and revenue, but obviously takes a loss. How do you balance that in this growth environment, should we expect R&D to maybe continue to move up as you look at those opportunities? -- It's a very good point and again we're really trying to work that balance of continue to invest. We can keep on this very strong growth, but also returns to the investors. And so you will see some growth and on a percentage basis, we're increasing our headcount and software and IP and things above that silicon level if you will much more.Having said that, we're also putting a big focus, that's why you hear me in the highlights and I think hopefully you took away from our Developers Forum that we really try and drive an ecosystem. So it's not just the Xilinx R&D budget, but it's the collective budget of the ecosystem as well as partners like A&T, like Samsung and others.So it's an end of all those things, we're trying to do all those things. But it is part of our balance on how we deliver returns as well as continue to invest so that we can get higher leverage and more leverage in the model. -- Okay, thank you and congratulations. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. -- Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, as it relates to wireless and early 5G deployment, can you speak to I guess whether this is just prototyping today or other? And then importantly, what you've learned now on a content basis and how that translates into sustained growth into 2020 and beyond? -- Yes. So for the first part of it, it's -- what we're now seeing is not prototyping. I think we've been saying for some quarters that we're in virtually all the early proof-of-concept and prototyping. So now, what you're sort of seeing is some of that going into production. And I would say -- and then you heard me make the comment of radio and baseband.So we do have more content than we have had traditionally RFSoCs and another element and that is actually still emerging. And in terms of what we'll see there and that is absolutely production. It is most cost effective, power efficient, and size weight form factor based solution out there. I don't want to really -- how is the product like RFSoC. So yeah, it's pretty strong. So the second part of the question regarding -- -- What you are looking from the early deployments today as to what the revenue contributions can look like as we go into as deployment? -- Yeah. we continue to see wireless for the year ending up very strong. And although we still expect that things will be at times right, overall, 5G will be the largest deployment right, I think the industry has seen and so we're really well-positioned for that. Again, I think particularly with RFSoC, I think on the radio, we have an extremely strong position. Yeah. So, I do think this will go, but again no doubt there'll be some lumpiness as we go through. -- Great. And I guess as a follow up here. At your Developers Forum and you launched I think one of the key questions was the software to follow up on Joe's question. So curious how we should be thinking about key milestones there in terms of developers training instances? What should we be focused on? -- Yeah. We're trying to share each of those elements right. As you just said, expansion of FAS, but also non-FAS, it's certainly not all about that. Indeed, there tends to be a little bit of focus of us just in data center compute, but the Samsung Smart SSD product, we accelerate in storage.We also have positions in SmartNIC and Converge mix (ph). So I think it a very strong trend in the networking side of the business. There's the ecosystem and then our board business right, which I think we gave a little bit of a foreshadowing all the way back to our Analyst Day and how we've executed to that.So I think watch to see how many people are developing and offering that board and as those board and as that board business more meaningfully contributes to revenue in next fiscal year, that will be another sign of things. Our investment level, if we can keep up this great growth we're going to return some to the shareholders and we're going to reinvest to keep this flywheel spinning. -- Very helpful. Thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on strong results. Victor, I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more, in your prepared comments you said that you have your eye on the macro and if I look at the businesses that are probably most macro influence for you, it's industrial and A&D yet despite kind of a macro backdrop that we're all worried about, you're guiding pretty strong growth for the December quarter.Curious if you could kind of square that circle for me and as you answer the question, maybe talk about what might be share gains that you're picking up in those markets? -- Yeah. Well, A&D actually was down all that in the current quarter, but that was off a very strong quarter and we actually believe that going forward, that's going to strengthen up again. So we actually don't see any signs in the AND area for sensitive to that.I'll give you one where we do as a sub segment of our overall basket as you know our baskets are pretty big right. So test measure and emulation and prototyping for instance.You know within that there are semiconductor tests and we are seeing weakening as you might expect within that. On the other hand, emulation and prototyping, we're seeing great strength.So given all of those puts and takes we're still seeing TME is on track for an excellent year. So and also within test is also very specially tested including like 5G test equipment and we're seeing good strength there for obvious reasons. So I think this is part of this is the strength of the diversity that we have and also the high value and innovation that we have that we're less sensitive than to other products that are have perhaps or more options available for people just to switch in and out or just not as high value or not in the core of the system right.So I think that's that's one aspect of it. And again we walked into this quarter with very strong backlog I mean you know we feel good about the guidance and then of course FY '20 we give that in the Analyst Day and we'll certainly learnt a lot between now and then, but again we've looked at it and certainly we're very keenly aware of the environment. We're just seeing good signals for our business. -- The other follow-up, just relative -- go ahead, I'm sorry. -- No, no I think if you were -- I wasn't sure John whether you were referring to the overall growth that we're expecting quarter-on-quarter or just in the industrial and A&D is that one of the pieces you didn't talk about is continuing strength and communications particularly in wireless I think that aligns with the book the 4G LTE continued fill out and the growth in 5G. So that's the last piece of the overall growth story and then I'm sorry go ahead.. -- That's helpful. And then I guess Victor, as a follow-up I was intrigued by your comments about growth in data center in FY '20. Your confidence level seems pretty high. Seems like you've got a good line of sight. I know there's probably a lot you can't talk about, but I want to give you the opportunity to elaborate on that comment and what gives you that confidence that this new customers, is this silicon to board, maybe if you can help us just kind of parse that out? -- Yes well it's actually a blend. As I said we actually did get some revenue at the very end of Q2 for the Alveo Board. And by the way, we only have one board. Well, actually we have two boards, the U200 to U250, but we are going to launch more boards through the course of the next number of quarters.And I said that grow at a good rate, but it's starting from a very small number. So it's not meaningful, but FY '20 will be meaningful. So if you step back, we didn't have a Board's revenue stream at all, right. So that certainly is contributing to that.The other thing is there's a lot of games I can't really speak to right now, but I did get I am able to say as I mentioned Samsung's SmartSSD they launched that. I could tell you that we have a design win to do a smart memory dimm with a very major memory supplier but I cannot say who.So and then as you know a lot of the customers for competitive reasons play things close to the chest, but we do feel that next fiscal year, we will start seeing much more meaningful revenue. We've been saying that we are seeing good percentage growth of relatively smaller number and data center as a segment, but in next fiscal year particularly in the back half, we really see that it's going to start coming together. Does that help? -- Congratulations again guys. It does. Thank you.Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. -- Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to make sure I understood the confidence for the full-year. Victor is it and Lorenzo, is it dependent on comps 5G, 4G as well as Alveo beginning to kick in and what about the other segments? So I'm talking beyond the quarter that you're guiding for? -- Let me give a briefing and I will let Lorenzo add comments to this as well. I think one of the reasons and I mentioned also why we're very dialed into watching the macro situation we still see it as the appropriate guide is because of the breadth of the strength that we saw in Q2, which was carrying over into this quarter and also from what we can see for the Board. So included the first half came in stronger than our initial expectations for the year.So I would say it's the breadth. Yes. So that means generalizing your statement you just pointed out Communications and then Data Center board. But it goes beyond that because we're seeing strength in all the other markets. Even though within some of those markets there are weakness, right. As I said TME, our weaknesses in some of the segments within that bucket, but the overall larger end market that we report out looks really good for the year. -- No I don't have much to add. Just it's kind of obvious given the relative size of the end markets and the dynamic that we talked about with the growth in Communications. That continues, that's a large dollar contributor, but it is much more broad than that in a portfolio of end markets we support. -- Okay. And then within Communications if I remember the number correctly, you said it was up 35% year-over-year, but if you go back because you give us a sense for it has to be well below the peak level we saw a few years ago. So how far below are we from that level and now you have more content.So we should expect as we get into the broader 5G rollout six, eight quarters from now that number should be higher than what you did in the last build, thank you. -- Yes, give me just one second to make sure I'm not miss-aligning things. It is still for both of the end markets and in Communications, it is still meaningfully below the highs we've seen for both wired and wireless, in the past three and five years ago, but I think also the other thing to think about it given the growth of our other end markets is it's a smaller percentage of our overall business.So our overall exposure to that is smaller, but we do expect it that we have headroom as we discussed in both wired and wireless to get past the historic levels at some point in the future. -- Great. We like the diversified model. Thank you.Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. -- Thank you so much. Victor, obviously there's quite a bit of concern around end markets like industrials, automotives, semi test as you sort of addressed them. Can you give us an idea what sort of embedded in your back half guide for some of these end markets where we do have concerns. -- Well I think I talked a bit about TME right. We can start some weakness some areas but then some areas are up. So again from what we can see we think that for the year TME we will be up quite nicely overall and certainly in the first half things are strong right including service rate semiconductor test. On automotive we're seeing growth and we do still expect that to continue but just to put that in context I think we sort of talked about how automotive is sort of in the around -- -- 7% of our business. -- Yes, about 7% of our business. So even if there's some fluctuation on that, let's just put that in context right. So I would say again yes we watch it very carefully and there's some segments that will feel it because you know not to be repetitive but since we had such broad strength and some of these areas we know the dynamics are such that they won't be affected like since the operators have decided they want to pull in 5G. They're going to back off.Now they may modulate right the wrap but since we have always said that we really were planning more of a ramp in the later timeframe to some extent is the fact that accelerated has been upside right. And then RFSoC, which we've never had before that continues. We went like three more awards just this last quarter because there's just no other product like that. And so we will have more value in the radio side and there is more radio that's going to be deployed.So yes there are some areas that are weaker but again because of the broad strength and some of the leadership products that we have I don't think we're going to be as affected, but of course we're going to watch this very carefully. -- We're in a good position obviously in areas like wireless and even in auto where the platforms that we've been designed into with our products are high value products pretending to be in the ramp phase. So while macro factors may impact it, they're still in some ways gaining share versus alternatives in multiple end markets. But that puts us in a pretty good position. -- Great. And then as a quick follow up, Victor obviously you've been on the road quite a bit, hosting a lot of sessions and I'm sure you've had conversations with customers, but for Alveo specifically what's been the feedback so far? You talked about the ramp into December and more so into calendar '19. How should we think about the magnitude of that ramp again for Alveo specifically. Thank you. -- Yes, for FY'19 again starting from effectively zero just the very end of last quarter, so growing a percentage basis while we're not seeing that to be very material but through the course of FY'20 as I said in my comments, it will be meaningful revenue.I think the interest is high. I do think that how much more upside versus maybe being a little bit more moderate. There is certainly a degree of around some of the things that early questions around application development. In fact I'll just education and so forth and that's why we did the Developers Forum and hopefully you saw some of the momentum that we are getting and strong interest there, right.So it's early days but we do feel like the signals are, there is a lot of interest and revenue being meaningful FY'20 timeframe not FY'19. -- Got it. Thank you.Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Robert Baird. -- Hi good afternoon. You are now starting to go after semiconductor content that traditionally has been discrete chips to FPGA such as DAX and ADC in your RF series. What are the other content adjacency opportunities that you are seeing and can you talk about the candidate that if any in addition to that could be played as policy FPGA integration going forward? -- Yes, so one is if you look at Versal, to a degree the reason why that we keep trying to make sure people appreciate that it's not FPGA, it is exactly because of the richness of the multiple different types of compute engines and all the infrastructure we've built into that.It's got multi-core SOCs. It's got a network on a chip. It's got the next generation programmable adaptive hardware, the fabric and distributed GSP and memory and it's got this new some of the products, some of the sub families we call them series like for instance, CIA core series will have this new architecture called the AI engine.And so if you look at just the integration level and that of course is going to have all the multi max, Ethernet Max, high speed 30s, somewhere talk to integrated HPM on a silicon interopposer. It's a really, really complete and powerful platform. So that is exactly the direction that we're going in and so because of that, we can expand and we will expand our SAM.And we're increasing more and more the competition isn't just other FPGA. It's indeed well beyond that and then to get the leverage in, there's been a lot of good questions around this area, that that's why we're so focused on delivering the whole software stack and then driving an ecosystem around that. So yes they were integrating a tremendous amount of capability into our Versal products. -- Okay. That's very useful and then just going back on the Alevo broad opportunity. While we have opportunity -- even if we assume that the ASPs or has the list prize that you've mentioned trying to reconcile this with your targeted incremental revenue coming from Data Center suggest that you're probably making very conservative market share or adoption rate assumptions. Any color you could give us in terms of the assumption of market share or any type of adoption rate that you see so that you restrain to get to your guidance? -- Well, what I would say is that we -- I wouldn't say that we're being very conservative. but we're certainly trying to be measured because it is new for us. But as I said, we are seeing strong efforts. It's just pretty early days.I think we also we have to build out which we are, we're actively building out the whole go-to-market channels, all of that is being produced. So I would say again that we are going to be priced competitively but we deliver an awful lot of value and then we'll see about share.The whole acceleration segment is relatively new, right but we do feel like this is a whole new product revenue stream as well as a way to accelerate people getting to market with applications, right. Because we don't people have to start with a chip. So that's why again, we're pricing the value when we think we're going to capture that value but it's an emerging area, so. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from John Vinh from KeyBanc Capital. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on kind of the Data Center question that was asked earlier. It seems like you've got very good proof points right now with several of your customers like Huawei, WS and Baba adopting SaaS, but it seems like there's a much more meaningful opportunity if you can convince one of your customers to move forward with an internal acceleration architectures similar to what we've seen at Catapult.We think it'll take for one of your customers or potential customers to move forward with that used case. Is that something that we can think about happening potentially next year that's potentially baked into your expectations for a more meaningful growth in data center? -- Well look I agree with you, that the world's not just fast and indeed like I said earlier, it's not for us it's unlike many other suppliers it's not even just not Data Center compute right like in storage just we're working on memory and we're are in smart and converged next.But now back to your point, I agree and as I'm sure you heard in my opening comments, the Twitch grew, right, and they did an acceleration on video, right. So just goes to show again we do, do that and we are working with others.Again it's just always a bit challenging in terms of when things can be shared, but yes we have many engagements for internal acceleration, some of which involve machine learning, some which do not. I think Alveo is going to also help that because again it lowers the barrier significantly right for people to develop applications and also to bring that on plan. So its not everything that's going to run in public cloud, right. So I agree with you and I hope that I can share that going forward. -- Great, thank you. And then my follow up is on 5G. It seems like your customers are approaching 5G with a combination of using RFSoC and MPSoC some other FPGAs. Can you just talk about your expectations for 5G? Do you expect the majority of your 5G customers to move to RFSoC and because of the integration and the performance and the bomb cost savings does that give you more staying power late in the cycle as your customers consider kind of ASIC reversion as an opportunity? -- Absolutely. I think -- I couldn't have made the same statement better than you just articulated. I mean look the RFSoC really is like -- it's not hype. There's nobody that has a product like that. And by the way it's not just 5G, right. If any kind of massive MIMO itinerary application we see it in cable. We see it in other kinds of like radar applications and people are changing their architecture the radio architecture based on this.And so in that sense it's certainly pretty sticky. I don't really see what in that particular instance, people are being able to disrupt that and it's just getting started right. We just recently went into production and people are deploying.So I think RFSoC for certain will be very, very strong. But you're right it's not just the RFSoC. We are seeing usage of other MPSoCs as well as the fire FPJs at the 16 nanometer node. Some of that over the course of time could go to that.But right now things are so dynamic and things are moving so quickly, that isn't happening and I think that's going to actually 5G so ambitious and there are so many things happening that, that will probably happen for a bit longer. But I am not necessarily suggesting that our position in baseband will be as durable as our position in radio for instance, right.I think radio is and we already have a roadmap right. So it's not just the first generation RFSoC. We already have the product the next generation as well as in 7 nanometre, so. -- Great, thank you.Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. -- Hi this is Gene (ph) for Ross Seymore. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You touched on this previously, but how do you view Xilinx's benefit from the 5G transition as compared to the 4G transition, perhaps from a magnitude and duration perspective? -- Yeah, I mean, I think 5G is going to clearly over time significantly pass what 4G was as a industry and as for us, it's a bigger opportunity as well and it's both because of the 5G from technology perspective is so much more disruptive. It's much broader and it's really is not just a communications standard, but it's really being used as a term for a basket of technology including things like massive MIMO and which isn't inherently necessarily 5G.There's IoT being associated, also automotive. So it's very broad and very ambitious. And then it's not just because of the segment is bigger, it's also like, we innovated, we added value, that we're adding more value like again in RFSoC, for instance, right.For that matter MPSoC, but back in the 4G, we didn't have integrated multi-core RMSoCs and we didn't have really high performance ADCs and DOCs monolithically integrated. So, yes I think the general market will be bigger and broader and I think our opportunity over time will be significantly larger. -- Okay, as a follow up on the OpEx side, how far along are Xilinx's software investments in support of the data center efforts, do you expect those investments to slow or do they need to persist on a instructional or customer by customer engagement basis? -- Well I think, in broad strokes, it's certainly not going to slow. We need to in fact within what's reasonable and affordable so that we could return value to shareholders and still continue to invest.As I said, we'll probably invest from a headcount perspective, fortunately more in software and things about Silicon and we would at the silicon level. Having said that, we are investing in the ecosystem and also doing partnership. So we're really trying to expand the footprint. So, it's not just us.Now the other part that you alluded to is also true by some of the really, really big customers. There's a lot of customization of things that we work very closely with to make sure that we deliver to their needs and we are investing in doing that as well for, obviously with the top customers.So yeah, for both of those reasons just the broad horizontal investment as well as some key major customers we are and we will be investing more on software and IP and related things. -- Okay, thank you.Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. -- Thanks for taking my question. Just curious into the September quarter, you mentioned ZTE was back. Just curious how much that was and maybe versus what you were planning when you guided? And then just longer terms of curiosity, you talked about earlier 5G, if you can just relate it to the ramp of 4G and that's two sharp quarters in the beginning of 4Q and fell off.It sounds like 5G maybe a little longer lived. Just curious as you look out over the next few quarters or even years, the trajectory of 5G versus 4G. Thanks. -- Okay, so, the first part. ZTE, so as we said in the first, what all happened and which is I know everybody, we don't have any 10% customers or anyone that's even near 10% to be honest. Having said that, ZET is an important customer and so it was a component certainly of our growth. But again I want to emphasize that, that wasn't about ZTE. There is early deployments and we've seen strength from other major customers are wire to wireless.I would say, because like that occurred just at the very start of fiscal '19, I would say that, it's not as though we ZTE being above our original plan. Obviously, the head-to-head one less quarter to ship in, but it's not over our original, original plan. But we did have to take them out at the start of the fiscal year, but then, once we knew that it's back end, we just did appropriately.Okay so then in terms of 5G ramp, definitely as I said before, I think it will be larger. I think it will last longer, because it's so ambitious and there's so many -- there's going to be so many -- so much innovation even at the business model level of what's going to happen with 5G, but calling exactly the shape, heck, the last quarter we weren't saying that we were going to see it now. We're saying we were maintaining the 2020, mainly but now low and behold, it appears that people are wanting to start their deployment next year.So, I don't feel terribly comfortable in telling exactly how that rolls out. I do think it is still somewhat be bursty and that's why I want to caution people on that. But integrate over time, it's definitely going to be a big opportunity for us and it will be a long opportunity, because data bandwidth is going crazy and people want low latency and high bandwidth. So that build out is going to be very substantial. Not only in wires by the way, that's wired too, right. The whole entire network has to go and get upgraded. -- Great.Your last question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup. -- Thanks guys. I guess I'll try and ask that 5G question in another way. -- I like to be honest. -- Yeah, why not. I've been doing this for way too long. How far ahead of plan is your -- is your 5G? I know you're not going to give us the revenue, but if you look at the revenue you have right now, are we one, two, three quarters ahead of where you thought that would be?And then I know you're not going to talk about like the curve, but if you go back and look at previous upgrades and area interface standards, how long was it from sort of the original or excuse me, the initial ramp until peak and then do you think that this one -- the 5G could be a longer ramp from the initial until the peak? -- Okay. So the first part of the question is how far ahead and you consider one, two and three. I guess, what I would say is that I would imagine you're probably right, probably more than two, three kind of ish, I would say.And then in terms of again, and try to peak, that offer, I really, look, I'm not going to claim that I'm the visionary on this to be quite candid. But from and I do -- but I do talk to a lot of customers, right and technologist people in Xilinx that are way brighter than I am.So having said that, what I would say that you know, this is definitely going to be broader. It is very, very ambitious and by the way, and to add another big macro trend in so there everybody is looking at artificial intelligence, machine learning in the network right and that's going to bring a whole another level of things.So just given how ambitious and how changing this is going to be, not just to traditional market, I do think it will be just broader, that would be my qualitative leave. I certainly don't think I'm smart enough to call the delta to the peak. But, you know what, when we get a whole lot closer to it, the future is hard to predict and predictions are hard especially about the future. -- Great. I'll take it. Thanks, guys. -- Okay, great.And there are no further questions at this time. -- Great. Well, thanks for joining us today everyone.

ilinx (XLNX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.87 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.75 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.65 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this computer chipmaker would post earnings of $0.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of 1.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Xilinx, which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry, posted revenues of $746.25 million for the quarter ended September 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.06%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $619.50 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .Xilinx shares have added about 11% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.5%.While Xilinx has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Xilinx was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.74 on $721.32 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.99 on $2.86 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductors - Programmable Logic is currently in the top 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" is scheduled to report third-quarter 2018 results on Oct 25.Notably, the company's earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 19.9%.Last reported quarter, Intel reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.04 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel. Moreover, the figure soared 44.4% from the year-ago quarter and 19.5%, sequentially.In the second quarter, revenues totaled $16.96 billion, up 14.9% year over year and 5.6% quarter over quarter. The figure marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.91 billion. Notably, the company surpassed the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters.Intel projects third-quarter 2018 revenues of around $18.1 billion (+/-$500 million), up 12% year over year on the back of continued strength in data-centric business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $18.115 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of around 12.2%.Moreover, the analysts polled by Zacks predict third-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.15 per share, indicating a year-over-year rise of 13.9%.Let's see, how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.According to the Zacks model, a company with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.20%, which increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . | Intel's focus on data center, cloud, self-driving car and Internet of Things (IoT) are key growth drivers for the third quarter.We expect a robust performance from the data centric part to boost results. Data Center Group (DCG), Internet-of-Things Group (IOTG), Non-Volatile Memory Solutions (NSG) and Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) along with MobilEye form the crux of Intel's data-centric business model, which contributed almost 50% of the company's top-line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DCG currently stands at $5.942 billion, higher than $4.878 billion a year ago.Additionally, with a view to offer an ultra-portable laptop experience, the company introduced new 8th Gen Intel Core processors in the quarter under discussion. We believe, the new CPUs will expand the company's customer base, bolstering its Client Computing Group (CCG) revenues in turn.Notably, Microsoft's  newly announced Surface devices including Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2 leverage Intel's new Quad Core 8th gen processor.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCG is presently pegged at $9.289 billion, above $8.860 billion in the prior-year period.Intel's investments in field programmable gate array (FPGA) for acceleration (dramatically increases performances at very low power) and memory to reduce latency and increase speeds are helping it develop custom solutions for big players.In fact, in the quarter under review, the company acquired eASIC to gain customized chip-making technology capabilities, upping the ante against Xilinx  . Microsoft has selected Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing intelligent search features using real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI).Significantly, eASIC team will join the chipmaker's PSG unit. eASIC's structured ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit) microchips are expected to add a considerable depth to Intel's programmable solutions portfolio.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PSG is projected at $548 million, more than $469 million in the year-earlier quarter.Intel's 5G initiatives need no introduction. The company recently collaborated with SiTime Corporation in a bid to add Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) timing solutions capabilities to its 5G modem platforms.Further, strong demand for data center solid state drive (SSD) solutions is anticipated to aid NSG unit results. Intel unveiled a new SSD with storage capacity of 32 terabytes (TB). The latest compact drive, developed on the company's 3D NAND technology, is claimed to be Intel's ""densest drive ever"".The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NSG unit is estimated to be $1.156 billion, above $891 million in the year-ago quarter.During the third quarter, the company also acquired Vertex.AI, a Seattle, WA-based startup to add strong deep learning capabilities to its various operating domains. Notably, Vertex.AI will join Intel's Artificial Intelligence Products Group.Markedly, the sturdy synergies from MobilEye buyout enables Intel to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles - cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.Here is another company, which per our model also has the right combination of elements to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  has an Earnings ESP of +0.73% and a Zacks Rank of 1. The company is slated to report third-quarter earnings on Oct 25.

 is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter 2019 results on Oct 24.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 5.95%.In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 74 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and were much higher than the prior-year quarter's figure of 59 cents.Revenues increased 14% year over year to $684.4 million and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $672.2 million as well.For second-quarter fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $700-$720 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share and counter stiff competition from the likes of Intel  .Rising demand for the company's Ultrascale+ FPGAs from data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS) looks promising, with the client base featuring prominent names like Amazon  and Alibaba  .We note that the company's first and second generation Zynq products hit a new sales record in the last reported quarter, growing 76% year over year, driven by robust demand in automotive, industrial, communications, and data center markets. The Zynq SoC Platform, which includes Zynq at 28nm and both MPSoC and RFSoC at 16nm, is also a significant contributor to revenues.For the September quarter, Xilinx anticipates Data Center and TME (Testing, Measurement, and Emulation) segment to grow significantly on the back of key design wins from hyperscalers globally for accelerating applications beyond FaaS.Strong wireless revenue growth is likely to more than offset a slight decline in wired revenues, thereby driving revenues for the Communications segment. Early 5G deployment activity in Korea and the withdrawal of the denial order on ZTE are anticipated to be tailwinds.Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer segment is expected to be approximately flat whereas Industrial, Aerospace & Defense is expected to witness a decline. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

 (NASDAQ: XLNX) is sitting on a massive opportunity thanks to the growing demand for its chips  (AI). The chipmaker controls the majority of the  (FPGA) market -- chips that are finding traction in AI applications -- by successfully keeping rival  (NASDAQ: INTC) at bay on the back of solid  .But AI is just one of the reasons why you should consider Xilinx for your portfolio. The chipmaker pays a dividend that's well above the tech sector's average yield of 1.11%, and it has been increasing every year since 2011. But with Intel  , will Xilinx be able to sustain the growth of its dividend?Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx has a forward dividend yield of 1.84%. Its latest dividend increase came in April this year when the quarterly payout was raised by a penny to $0.36 a share. As the company has nearly 253 million shares outstanding, it is poised to pay out nearly $364 million in dividends over the next year.The company generated $512 million in net income during the latest fiscal year, which ended in March 2018. It paid out $353 million in the form of dividends, accounting for 69% of its earnings. Meanwhile, Xilinx generated $739 million in  in the trailing twelve months thanks to low capital expenses, which means that its  was a much more conservative 48% based on the free cash flow.The problem, however, is that its earnings have taken a hit of late. Xilinx's net income dropped close to 18% annually during fiscal year 2018, despite an 8% increase in revenue. That's because the company ramped up its operating expenses by 10% as it spent more on research and development, to boost its product development efforts and keep the competition at bay.In fact, the company's R&D expenses have been rising at a faster pace than the top line: data by  .So, Xilinx's ability to increase its dividend is very limited right now. As a result, the company has been conservative when it comes to boosting the payout -- its latest increase earlier this year was a paltry 2.9%. On the flip side, the company's conservative payout indicates that the dividend is safe.More importantly, Xilinx is in a position to give its dividend a major bump in the long run. The increasing demand for FPGAs in AI applications and the company's lead in FPGA technology eventually should lead to better bottom-line performance and an increase in free cash flow.FPGA's provide cost efficiencies in both the training and inferencing phase of AI models, positioning them to be a key catalyst for Xilinx. FPGAs are better than graphics processing units (GPUs) in certain AI-related applications, which is why the FPGA market is expected to jump from $6.9 billion in 2016 to $12.1 billion in 2024.The good news is that Xilinx controls close to 60% of the FPGA market, with plans to further boost its market share to 65% in the next three years. The business is well positioned to hit this market share target thanks to its technology lead over Intel. As it stands, Xilinx is set to roll out its advanced FPGAs in 2019.Intel's competing 10nm chips were expected to hit the market in 2015 but likely will not see the light of the day  as the chip giant is stuck on the 14nm process for the foreseeable future. This gives Xilinx an opportunity to boost its lead over Intel: Chips based on a smaller manufacturing node are better in terms of both power consumption and manufacturing costs, and they carry more processing power.More importantly, Xilinx's technology lead is helping it score lucrative contracts.  is already using Xilinx's FPGAs in one of its virtual servers, while  is developing an AI-based in-car system using the chipmaker's automotive platform.Additionally, South Korea's largest mobile operator  (NYSE: SKM) recently deployed Xilinx's FPGAs to accelerate the automatic speech recognition (ASR) application in its data centers. This is the first commercial application of FPGAs in large-scale data centers in South Korea, paving the way for more design wins in the space. Xilinx claims that SK Telecom's ASR application is now five times faster than GPUs and 16 times more efficient on a performance-per-watt basis.Xilinx is setting itself up for long-term growth, so investors shouldn't be overly concerned about the drop in its net income last year. Once its latest products hit the market next year, the company can increase the 18-month technology lead that it currently enjoys over arch-rival Intel.That's because Intel's competing FPGAs are still a couple of years away as we saw earlier. This strong technology lead will help Xilinx boost sales as it will be in a stronger position to tap the FPGA market's growth, which should eventually boost its bottom line and increase the free cash flow. In fact, consensus estimates project that Xilinx's bottom line will grow at nearly 16% per year for the next five years.So, Xilinx will be in a stronger position to boost its dividend. This is why dividend investors should keep this stock on their radar: It can provide a solid combination of AI-driven growth and a higher payout in the long run.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Xilinx (XLNX) reports results for the quarter ended September 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 24, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This computer chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.4%.Revenues are expected to be $710.33 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Xilinx, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xilinx will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xilinx would post earnings of $0.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +1.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xilinx doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - October 8, 2018 - Stocks in this week's article include: Colfax Corp.  , United Therapeutics Corp.  , Trinseo S.A.  , Xilinx, Inc.  and Archer Daniels Midland Company  .A 52-week high level generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Notably, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.And that's what we're screening for today…Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

he third-quarter earnings season has begun, with results of 84 S&P 500 members out as of Oct 19. Per the latest  , total earnings of these 84 members increased 19.2% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues, with 82.1% beating EPS estimates and 61.9% beating revenue estimates.Further, the report suggests that third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are projected to improve 19.2% year over year on 7.2% revenue increase.The technology sector, of which semiconductor stocks are a part, appears to be quite strong. For the sector, earnings are expected to improve 15% year over year while revenues are likely to rise 11.4%. Notably, it is one of the 10 sectors anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth in the quarter to be reported.Coming to semiconductors, the industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems, gaming, wearables, drones, virtual reality/ augmented reality devices and artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling growth in the space. The accelerated deployment of 5G technology is also likely to spur growth.Notably, the Semiconductor Industry Association on Oct 1 said that global semiconductor sales reached $40.16 billion in August, up 14.9% year over year. Moreover, global semiconductor sales were 1.7% higher than July's total of $39.49 billion.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company's earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management's ability to implement operating and strategic plans.We note that the fears of trade war have been an overhang on chip stocks. With China being one of the biggest markets for semiconductors, investors are apprehensive about the impact of a full-fledged trade war on chip stocks.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

"n Oct 4, chip stocks took a beating after Deutsche Bank  reduced its 2019 earnings estimates for a number of chipmakers, citing growing weakness in business activity. This raised panic among investors, leading to huge selloffs on Thursday.That said, chip stocks have been largely responsible for the long-running market rally. However, fears of a bubble are making a comeback courtesy of a bunch of market watchers, who feel that the trade war has started taking a toll on chip stocks.However, the sector's fundamentals are still strong, with global semiconductor sales increasing once again in August, per the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). Given this scenario, it makes semiconductor stocks must haves for your portfolio.On Oct 4, investors' confidence was dented after Deutsche Bank reduced its 2019 earnings estimates by 5% on average for as many as eight chipmakers. The firm cited weakness in business activity as a major reason that could affect the semiconductor industry.This resulted in investors panicking, leading to huge selloffs. This saw shares of Texas Instruments Incorporated  , Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.  and Analog Devices, Inc.  plummeting 2.1%, 2.3% and 2%, respectively.The PHLX Semiconductor index (SOX) declined more than 1.8%. Understandably, trade war fears have been making investors jittery. China is one of the biggest markets for semiconductors and investors are panicking that a full-fledged trade war could hit the chip stocks.Semiconductor stocks may have been taking a hit of late but chip stocks have been responsible for the market's rally for quite some time now. Trade war fears have been gripping markets, making investors jittery. Despite this, the Semiconductor Industry Association on Oct 1 said that global semiconductor sales reached $40.16 billion in August, up 14.9% year over year. Moreover, global semiconductor sales were 1.7% higher than July's total of $39.49 billion.This is also the first time that monthly global chip sales have topped the $40 billion mark. According to John Neuffer, president and CEO, Semiconductor Industry Association, ""Sales remain strong across every major semiconductor product category and regional market, with the China and Americas markets standing out with the largest year-year growth.""Also, regional sales compared to August 2017 increased in China to 27.3%. Moreover, per research firm, Inkwood Research, the global semiconductor market is projected to witness a CAGR of 7.67% between 2017 and 2024.China is one of the biggest markets for semiconductors and trade war fears have been denting investors' confidence. However, the impressive sales figures are a proof that the fears might just be overblown. Also, China's limitations in building its own tech industry might restrict it from acting against U.S.-based chipmakers.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, while China is its biggest market. Trade war fears definitely have dented investors' confidence but chip stocks aren't as susceptible to trade war as industrials. Also, China's limitations in building its own tech industry might restrict it from acting against U.S.-based tech players.Given the robust demand for semiconductors and an increase in global semiconductor sales once again in August, the recent fears may be overblown. This is why picking semiconductor stocks still looks like a smart option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.

 recently unveiled Alveo, a suit of accelerator cards, aimed at increasing the performance and productivity of industry-standard servers across cloud and on-premise data centers.The Alveo U200 and Alveo U250 will enable customers to reconfigure hardware and optimize their productivity according to changing workloads, standards and algorithms, sans any extra replacement costs.A brief look into the technicalities shows the advantages of Alveo over a wide range of applications. For instance, one of the characteristics of Alveo U250 is that it boosts real-time inference throughput 20 times compared with sophisticated CPUs.The Alveo chips are powered by the Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA (field-programmable gate arrays). We are optimistic about the demand of Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGAs by data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service. Amazon was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017. The list also includes Alibaba, which is in the process of deploying two generations of FPGA-as-a-Service by using Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGA chips.Notably, Xilinx's new reporting segment, Data Center and Test, Measurement & Emulation grew 11% from the year-ago quarter. Key design wins from hyperscalers globally for accelerating applications beyond FPGA as a Service drove results.The company already has a stronghold in the FPGA market, with a market share of 58% compared with its biggest competitor Intel  , which held a share of 42% as of April 2018. According to Xilinx, it enjoys an 18-month lead over Intel in the FPGA market, which, per MarketsandMarkets, is projected to witness a CAGR of 8.5% in the 2017-2023 period.We expect that the surge in demand for FPGAs will be backed by its unique ability to be reprogrammed to the desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing. Therefore, we believe that Xilinx is well placed to grab the opportunity arising from an increase in adoption of AI technologies, 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles and IoTs.The company believes that the launch of Alveo accelerator cards will further boost its transformation into a platform company, which has been helping it gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform launched last year, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel.In a similar effort, Xilinx has simultaneously launched Versal, the industry's first adaptive compute acceleration platform aimed at delivering scalability and AI inference capabilities for applications across different markets, which is slated to hit the market next year.The launch of the Versal platform is expected to further strengthen Xilinx's competitive position against Intel, and also help it counter competition from NVIDIA  . Management says that the Versal chips will offer up to eight times the inference benchmark performance against currently available NVIDIA GPUs. Moreover, the chips are expected to deliver up to 72 times faster inference workload performance compared to Intel's Xeon processors.Earlier this year, Xilinx launched the Everest chips, based on the 7-nanometer (nm) architecture, while Intel is currently still advancing from a 14nm to a 10nm platform.Robust steps to gain more market share in the industries in which it operates, is boosting Xilinx's growth. Shares of the company have outperformed the S&P 500's rally of 9.9%, with an average return of 19%.Xilinx currently carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock in the broader Computer and Technology sector is Salesforce.com Inc  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth for Salesforce is pegged at 25%.Zacks Research has released a report that may shock many investors. One stock stands out as the best way to invest in the surge to electric cars. And it's not the one you may think!Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium battery power is set to shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, revenues that were already at $31 billion in 2016 are expected to blast to over $67 billion by the end of 2022.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $78.67, changing hands for $79.90/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $70.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $90.00. The standard deviation is $7.547.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $78.67/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $78.67 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks.Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential.

The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.The lower, the better.This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception.

 recently strengthened its flagship product, Wdesk platform, with new solutions for internal audit management. The announcement was made at Workiva User Conference during its opening session.The latest Wdesk's solution offers real-time association, certification, workpaper execution and workflow to aid customers with auditability, control and linking features. The new solution provides internal auditors with greater business visibility for better risk management across organizations.One of the first customers using Wdesk for internal audit management is Bradley Carroll, Senior Vice President and Chief Audit Executive at State Bank and Trust Company of Atlanta, GA. The newly added solution to Wdesk will help to examine risks and increase transparency consequently mitigating operation risks through continuous feedback process.The new audit-driven solutions promise enhanced business insights that accelerate financial transformation. In fact, the company is leaving no stone unturned to aid customers in their journey of internal audit management.Notably, shares of Workiva have returned approximately 63.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the  's rally of 23.1%.Per a Gartner survey, enterprises are migrating to cloud based financial management applications faster than anticipated. The surveyed senior finance executives reveal that by 2020, 36% of enterprises will leverage the cloud for more than 50% of their transactional systems on record. We believe this rapid shift is likely to benefit Workiva as it continues to strengthen its cloud platform - Wdesk.Per a recent ResearchandMarkets report, the global financial services application market will be worth $117.1 billion by 2023 from $74.35 billion as of 2017. Notably, the market is currently growing at a CAGR of 7.9% and the time period under consideration is 2018-2023. We believe that since Wdesk is mostly used for auditing and accounting, the company remains well poised to benefit from growth of the relevant market.Workiva's persistent focus on developing its Wdesk cloud platform, which is used for collecting, integrating, managing and analyzing business data, is aiding the company to gain traction.Workiva continues to expand its existing customer base with its accounting, SOX and compliance software. This expansion in clientele along with a widening partner ecosystem is expected to drive growth.However, the company faces intensifying competition in the Global Financial Service space from Oracle Hyperion Planning, Accenture Financial Services, to name a few.Currently, Workiva carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Xilinx, Inc.  , Salesforce.com Inc  and Aspen Technology, Inc.  , all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Xilinx, Salesforce and Aspen are 9.5%, 25% and 16.5%, respectively.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" 52-week high level is used as an indicator. A stock nearing that level is considered a winner.Investors often wonder if the high price has made the stock overpriced. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in a bid to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels.A stock can continue the momentum and keep touching new highs as time progresses. So, a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left is beneficial in these cases.Here, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase, ""buy high, sell higher.""Many a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that doesn't always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.We ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.The lower, the better.This metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.This helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 23 stocks that made it through the screen: is a manufacturer, designer and distributor of apparel and accessories under licensed brands, owned brands and private label brands.

Chicago, IL -September 13, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  ,  and  .Political scandals and blistering criticism have been bogging down tech companies for a while now. But, Apple Inc's reversal of a four-day losing streak ahead of its annual product launch boosted the overall sector. We also shouldn't forget that tech stocks have been the strongest performers so far this year, with both computer and software makers, and chip-related companies making giant strides on tax reforms and fundamentals.As Apple led a rebound in tech shares, investing in tech companies seems judicious. Also, tech companies are well positioned to register double-digit growth in the third-quarter earnings season.Shares of Apple gained the most in the last five weeks on heavier-than-expected volume as investors piled in on the eve of the company's annual product launch. The Cupertino-based company's shares rose 2.5% on Sep 11, raising the year-to-date gain to 32%. More than 35 million shares changed hands -- nearly 1.4 times the company's three-month average.Apple is about to launch three items, including iPhone Xs Line and Apple Watch Series 4. These models are likely to hike the company's average smartphone price by 5.4% year over year to $793 in fiscal 2019, per investment giant Goldman Sachs.Optimism surrounding Apple pushed UBS Group AG's Timothy Arcuri to lift his 12-month price target to $250, which will be a 12% rally from its current level. By the way, latest carrier checks showed a considerable reduction in store inventories for the iPhone. This is an extremely positive sign since iPhone continues to bring in the bulk of Apple's revenues. It accounted for 56% of total revenues in the fiscal third quarter.The company reported strong earnings results for the quarter ended Jun 30. It's earnings per share grew 40% year over year and revenues increased 17%. Growth in products like Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats headphones and iPhones helped the company report stellar numbers. By the way, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is also above Wall Street predictions.Thus, Apple became the first U.S. company with a market cap of more than $1 trillion (read more:  ).The iPhone maker lent momentum to the tech rally. In fact, the bellwether tech name led the broader tech rally. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) jumped 0.9% on Sep 11, one of the top gainers among all the S&P 500 sectors.Computer and software makers are already having a ball owing to the White House's initiative to trim tax rates. The extra cash from tax cuts is helping tech companies pursue merger and acquisitions. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force for tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have room to invest.High-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and automation, in the meantime, are driving demand for chips. In any case, the overall tech sector is expected to notch double-digit gains in the third quarter (read more:  ).And if this happens, it would be the fifth successive quarter that the Information Technology sector of the S&P 500 produced earnings growth of 20% or more.Given the aforesaid bullishness, investors should double down on the hottest tech stocks.

" 's  focus on product innovation, acquisition of Lifetouch and improved operational efficiency through major restructuring bodes well for the company. Consequently, shares of Shutterfly have witnessed a significant gain of 53% in a year's time against the  's decline of 15.7%. However, seasonal demand and possibility of an increase in costs remain concerns.Shutterfly's growth potential lies in its innovative products and business model differentiation. Continual expansion of its product range is an integral part of Shutterfly's strategy. The company launched more than 20 new products in personalized gifts and home décor in 2017 in order to entice new customers and generate a higher number of orders. Moreover, the company is making progress with Shutterfly 3.0 initiative, under which it created a new photo-management solution by integrating ThisLife technology. This is expected to improve customer relationships and drive sales over time.Also, the company's focus on personalized products leads to competitive advantage and business model differentiation. Further, the sale of its products through e-commerce adds to its competitive strength. Moreover, the company's focus on profitable and cost-effective brands widens its competitive moat. This even led to a major restructuring of its existing brands that helped it to improve operational efficiency and create a quality brand portfolio.We further believe the company's deal to acquire Lifetouch, a privately held online photography entity, will help it to significantly expand customer base and boost consumer segment revenues. To this tune, the company expects to further add approximately $780 million to $790 million to its adjusted revenues and $100 million to adjusted EBITDA over the first nine months of operations. By 2020, the company targets a minimum $450 million of adjusted EBITDA.The aforementioned strategic efforts have helped the company to report better-than-expected results in the trailing four quarters. In fact, its second-quarter earnings marked the 70th consecutive quarter of year-over-year net revenue growth. In the reported quarter, the company's top line surged 112.1% year over year owing to the acquisition of Lifetouch and robust performance of the Shutterfly Business Solutions segment.The company's business is impacted by consumer spending in the United States. Uncertainty in the real estate market and home values, fluctuating energy and commodity costs and limited credit availability are the major factors that hurt consumer spending patterns.Additionally, fluctuations in sales due to seasonal demand for digital camera, driven by vacation and other travel trends, hurt its profits. The company's business is highly affected by softness in the travel industry due to macro-economic slowdown or political instability. Further, costs related to accelerated development of new production facilities along with a rise in manufacturing, labor and training costs are likely to hurt the company's margin.Shutterfly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the  are TechTarget, Inc.  , Xilinx, Inc.  and ACI Worldwide, Inc.  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .TechTarget has an expected current-year earnings growth rate of 68.2%.Xilinx delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6% over the last four quarters.ACI Worldwide reported better-than-expected earnings in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 69.7%.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 month has gone by since the last earnings report for Xilinx (XLNX). Shares have lost about 1.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500 .Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Xilinx due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Xilinx reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter 2019 results wherein both the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and recorded year-over-year improvement.The company reported earnings of 74 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and were much higher than the prior-year quarter's figure of 59 cents.Revenues increased 14% year over year to $684.4 million and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $672.2 million as well.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped 21% year over year, contributing 56% to total revenues. Revenues from core products (44% of total) increased 5% from the year-ago quarter.Management noted that the company's first and second generation Zynq products hit a new sales record in the quarter, growing 76% from the year-ago quarter, driven by robust demand in automotive, industrial, communications, and Data Center markets. The Zynq SoC Platform, which includes Zynq at 28nm and both MPSoC and RFSoC at 16nm, now contributes 17% of total revenues.Sales of 20-nm node soared 30% year over year in the reported quarter. Xilinx noted that the sales of 16-nm node increased more than 2.5 times.On the basis of end markets, Communications revenues (31% of total revenues) declined 7% year over year. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (33% of total revenues) climbed 30% on a year-over-year basis. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (16% of total revenues) increased 13% year over year.The new reporting segment, Data Center and Test, Measurement & Emulation (TME) (19% of total) grew 11% from the year-ago quarter. Key design wins from hyperscalers globally for accelerating applications beyond FPGA as a Service (FaaS) drove results.However, due to decline in cryptocurrency and expected decline in TME, Data Center and TME segment fell 20% sequentially. Communication segment revenues were up 7% from the prior quarter driven by strong growth in both wired and wireless, which offset the impact of ZTE.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific were up 12%, 14%, 12% and 15%, respectively.Gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) year over year to 69.8%.Research & development and selling, general & administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 40 bps and 160 bps, respectively.Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined 200 bps to 38.3%.The company posted operating income of $215.8 million, up 27.6% year over year. Operating margin expanded 350 bps to 31.5%.Xilinx exited the reported quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $3.36 billion compared with $3.45 billion recorded in the previous quarter.The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.207 billion, down from $1.214 billion reported in the previous quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $176.2 million from operations compared with $242.3 million in the previous quarter.The company paid $91 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares for $137 million. The company has approximately $570 million remaining in repurchase authorizations.For second-quarter fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $700-$720 million.Management expects Data Center and TME to grow significantly. Communications is expected to increase, with strong wireless revenue growth to more than offset a slight decline in wired revenues. Early 5G deployment activity in Korea and the withdrawal of the denial order on ZTE will be tailwinds.On the other hand, Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer is expected to be approximately flat. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense is expected to decline.Gross margin is expected to be around 69.5%. Operating expenses are projected to be $279 million. Tax rate is estimated between 10% and 14%.For fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $2.8-$2.9 billion (mid-point $710 million).The company expects strong growth from Data Center, TME, Industrial, and Communications. Wireless is expected to grow significantly with early 5G production deployments and the anticipated recovery of business with ZTE. The company is also witnessing an increase in wired infrastructure deployment in concurrence with the 5G ramp.Gross margin is expected to be between 68.5 and 70.5%. Operating expenses are projected to be in the range of $1.12-$1.14 billion.It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month. The consensus estimate has shifted 5.95% due to these changes.Currently, Xilinx has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its momentum is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for momentum based on our style scores.Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - August 23, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple  , Alphabet  , Tesla  , Xilinx  and NetApp  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Last week, Berkshire stocked up on Apple shares, a long-time analyst talked about the next trillion dollars in its valuation, an Aussie teen hacked in to its computer and more.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway added to its steadily growing position in Apple, as the consumer-focused technology company continues to move from strength to strength, making relatively fewer mistakes than many of its peers. Berkshire's Apple holdings grew by 12 million shares and now constitute 24% of its holdings, giving him an ownership stake of 5% in Apple.The fund's policy is to keep holdings in any company at under 10% to avoid regulatory compulsions, so there's scope to add much more. Between the time that he first invested in Apple in 2016 to today,  has gone from $93 to $210, so investors would be pleased.Quite the opposite is the case with Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, which has been taking losses of late and seeing investors cash out. Einhorn recently cut its stake in Apple and some other stocks, possibly to raise capital to offset losses resulting from his bet on Bayer, which fell 10% following jury findings that its Monsanto unit failed to warn that its weed killers pose cancer risks.Berkshire's move speaks of the confidence in Apple shares, especially given escalating trade tensions with China, which remains a very important market for Apple, and to a much lesser extent, Turkish present Erdogan's bombast about boycotting American electronics (especially from Apple) in response to President Donald Trump's attempt to meddle in its internal affairs.Long-time Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, now at Hong Kong-based TF International Securities, has put out a note naming the next two genres that will take Apple to a $2 trillion valuation. In his words, ""Services, AR and Apple Car will create Apple's next trillion-dollar market cap.""As far as AR is concerned, the company has been dropping tantalizing hints of its progress, along with promises that its entire product line will someday have AR, introducing a new file format called USDZ to facilitate rendering for AR developers and launching ARKit 2. AR glasses including their own small displays and processors are also in the works for a tentative launch some time in 2020 if media rumors are to be believed.A couple of years after that will come Apple's own electric car. This is news because there have been an equal number of reports saying that Apple will just sell the technology for other people's cars the way Alphabet's Waymo is doing, or at least that it was undecided on the issue. The return of high profile engineer Doug Field from Tesla, where he was in charge of vehicle engineering, is significant in this context.A 16-year old Aussie fan of Apple, hacked the company's mainframe from his suburban home and accessed 90GB of data over the course of a year that he stored in a file called ""hacky hack hack"" and then boasted about it on WhatsApp.Apple said that its security personnel ""discovered the unauthorized access, contained it, and reported the incident to law enforcement"" and said of its customers that ""at no point during this incident was their personal data compromised.""Apple contacted the U.S. FBI, which referred the case to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the above details were uncovered in court. So Apple's assurance that personal data wasn't compromised doesn't make sense.The teen's identity is not being disclosed because of his age, but a sentence is due on September 20. Pity because his ""dream"" was to work at Apple.""Group FaceTime has been removed from the initial release of iOS 12 and will ship in a future software update later this fall,"" Apple said in its latest developer release of the softwareThere it is. Like it or not, and question it or not since it has been in testing for a while, this major feature upgrade that allows up to 32 people to video chat at the same time and supports Apple's Animoji, won't make it to iOS 12 when it launches with the new line of iPhones and iPads next month.Apple has reportedly removed 25,000 apps from its China App Store that the Chinese government didn't approve of. But since this is just 1.4% of the total apps available according to CCTV, it may not be such a big deal. Wagering apps are illegal in China, so a large number of these apps were removed.Apple shares carry a zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

hether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Based in San Jose, Xilinx (XLNX) is in the Computer and Technology sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 5.34%. The computer chipmaker is paying out a dividend of $0.36 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.03% compared to the Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry's yield of 2.02% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.79%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.44 is up 2.9% from last year. Xilinx has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.74%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Xilinx's current payout ratio is 49%, meaning it paid out 49% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, XLNX expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.98 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.30%.Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that XLNX is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n June of 2015, chip behemoth  (NASDAQ: INTC) announced that it intended to buy Altera, a major supplier of chips known as field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, for  . FPGAs, Intel explains, are chips ""where a large majority of the electrical functionality inside the device can be changed.""In pitching this big buy to shareholders, then-CEO Brian Krzanich told investors that ""product synergies"" -- in other words, the combination of Altera's FPGA technology with Intel's own microprocessor assets in areas like the data center and the Internet of Things -- were expected ""to drive roughly 60% of the value we create with this acquisition.""Image source: Intel.Then-CFO Stacy Smith explained that the remaining 40% of that value creation would come from ""meaningful reductions in [operating expenses] and improved competitiveness in Altera's existing product line by bringing them onto our manufacturing processes and using our IDM tools."" An IDM, short for ""integrated device manufacturer,"" refers to a company that both designs and manufactures its own chips.Let's check up on how Altera, now known as Intel's programmable solutions group (PSG), is doing.During the second quarter of 2018, Intel's PSG generated $517 million in revenue, which was up 17.5% year over year. Operating income came in at $101 million, up just 4.1% year over year. The segment's operating margin, as a result, declined to around 19.5% from about 23.3% in the same quarter a year ago.Intel said that sales of FPGA products to data center customers grew 140% year over year and sales of its ""advanced products"" -- that is, products built on 28nm, 20nm, and 14nm chip-manufacturing technologies -- rose about 70% year over year.""We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago, and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center,"" interim CEO Bob Swan said. ""In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter.""Swan made another comment that investors should take notice of: ""PSG again set a record for design win volume, indicating customers' confidence in our roadmap and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center, through the network, and out to the edge.""The main competitor to Intel's PSG is a company called  (NASDAQ: XLNX) . Since Intel made it clear when it announced its intention to buy Altera that it hoped to help Altera gain market segment share, it's worth watching any potential market share shifts between the two companies.In the table below, I've included both Intel's PSG revenue and revenue growth last quarter as well as those same figures from Xilinx:
  
Data sources: Intel, Xilinx 10-Q filings. YOY = year over year.Since Intel's PSG grew revenue faster than Xilinx did last quarter, it would seem that PSG gained some revenue share last quarter (although Xilinx still has more overall share of the market).Xilinx reported that revenue from its ""advanced products"" -- that is, products manufactured on 28nm, 20nm, and 16nm technologies -- grew 21% last quarter. Intel's PSG, on the other hand, reported that its own ""advanced products"" (products built on 28nm, 20nm, and 14nm technology) revenue grew 70% year over year last quarter.Based on those growth rates, Intel's PSG appears to have gained share in what the companies refer to as ""advanced products"" last quarter.Intel's PSG has been delivering solid revenue growth during the first half of 2018, with sales up about 17.3% in that time. However, the segment's operating profits grew far slower than revenue did, up just under 4.8% year over year in that time, meaning that the segment's  has declined.During a question-and-answer session with an analyst in June, Intel PSG chief, Dan McNamara, said that the company ""really needed to invest over the last couple years to get back to the pace that the market and our competitors were at.""The executive also said that as far as spending goes, ""I believe we got back to where we wanted to be"" and that the business is going to focus on ""efficiency and also leveraging the best of Intel.""When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them!

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.44), with the stock changing hands as low as $70.58 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

Here's the company's Chief Executive Officer Victor Peng giving a market outlook and touching on the performance in the data center segment and recent acquisitions:The company raised its revenue target for the year by roughly $100 million, and it now expects sales under its new accounting system to come in between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion.Xilinx's leadership position in  has it poised to capitalize on high-growth markets like data centers, machine vision, and artificial intelligence.

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $76.18, changing hands for $76.99/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $67.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $87.00. The standard deviation is $6.968.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $76.18/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $76.18 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

"Chicago, IL - August 8, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple Inc  , Adobe Systems Incorporated  , Intel Corporation  , Xilinx, Inc.  and Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Tech shares, which have had a tumultuous start to the month, started scaling north following strong quarterly results from Apple Inc among others. While computer and software makers are having a ball owing to the White House's initiative to trim tax rates, high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and automation are driving demand for chips.As tech companies continue to dominate the equity market, total earnings for the sector are up 35% on 12.9% higher revenues in the second quarter, with 89.7% beating earnings estimates and 87.2% trumping revenue estimates.Tech bellwether Apple, in the meantime, became the first U.S. company with a market cap of more than $1 trillion. And it's only after the company reported strong earnings results for the quarter ended Jun 30. It's earnings per share grew 40% year over year and revenues increased 17%. Growth in products including Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats headphones and iPhones helped the Cupertino-based company report stellar numbers. By the way, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is also above Wall Street predictions (read more:  ).The Republican tax overhaul policy is providing the much-needed windfall to tech companies. The extra cash from tax cuts is helping tech companies pursue merger and acquisition activities. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force for tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest. At the same time, IoT, which connects various devices to the cloud, is expected to be a huge growth driver for tech majors.Chip makers, for now, are making giant strides as chips are in demand for some of the fastest growing tech industries in the world like e-sports and crypto mining. E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, need thousands of semiconductor chips for production. These chips are an essential part of crypto mining as they provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.The latest buzz in the stock market is buybacks. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. predicted that stock repurchases will reach $1 trillion this year, up 46% from last year. Buyback authorization, in fact, is expected to surge this month. Goldman added that August typically accounts for 13% of such deals for the year.And tech accounts for the largest share of such buybacks. In the second quarter itself, share repurchases are up 57% from the same period a year earlier, while buybacks in the tech sector surged 130% year over year, per Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

"ield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are in strong demand thanks to their versatility. The programmable nature of these chips means that they can be wired to tackle specific applications after they are manufactured, making them ideal for deployment in data centers to accelerate artificial intelligence workloads. This is one of the reasons why FPGA sales are expected to jump from just under $6 billion last year to almost $10 billion in 2023, according to one estimate.The secular growth of this market should be great news for  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , which has  (NASDAQ: INTC) in the FPGA market. FPGA pure-play specialist Xilinx controlled nearly 60% of the market at the end of 2017, with Intel commanding the rest. But it looks like the status quo has started changing.Image Source: Getty Images.Intel's programmable solutions group (PSG) revenue shot up 18% year over year during the second quarter to $517 million thanks to strong demand for its FPGAs in the data center. In fact, Chipzilla claims that its data center sales within PSG have now  for two quarters in a row.As such, Intel is now clocking an annual revenue run rate of over $2 billion in FPGAs, which is pretty close to Xilinx's trailing-12-month revenue of $2.5 billion. So the gap between the two companies isn't much right now, and it might not be long before Intel overtakes Xilinx in this market. This seems a bit surprising as Xilinx reportedly enjoys an 18-month technology lead over Intel in FPGAs, but the latter has been outgrowing its nemesis of late.Xilinx's revenue in the latest quarter grew 14% year over year, trailing Intel's growth. What's more, a closer look indicates that Intel's FPGA business has been growing at a faster pace than Xilinx in recent quarters.Data from Xilinx and Intel quarterly reports, Chart by author. PSG = Programmable Solutions Group.So Intel has managed to upstage Xilinx despite being behind on the FPGA technology curve. However, Xilinx has a  in the form of Project Everest. The FPGA specialist could start shipping chips based on the more efficient 7-nanometer manufacturing node as soon as next year.Intel, meanwhile, will be stuck with the  for a while, provided it doesn't delay its latest target of launching 10nm chips by the end of 2019. Intel's chief engineering officer, Murthy Renduchintala, believes that the company's 10nm data center products will hit the shelves ""shortly after"" the PC chips, which means that it might be close to another two years before we see a new-gen Intel FPGA.But Chipzilla won't let this disadvantage hurt its FPGA momentum as it has found a new way to attract customers.Intel recently acquired semiconductor manufacturer eASIC, which makes customizable chips for deployment in cloud computing and other wireless environments for an undisclosed sum. This move is expected to help Intel address a major problem with FPGAs.The fact that FPGAs can be customized to perform specific tasks has boosted their popularity as they are more efficient at executing AI applications. But they need to be transformed into ASICs once an application doesn't need customization.In simpler words, once an application has stopped changing, it has to be run using chips that are more structured in nature to deliver better performance and consume lower power. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are well-equipped to handle the post FPGA stage because of their power efficiency and ability to be configured quickly.This is where Intel's acquisition of eASIC comes into play. Dan McNamara, the general manager of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, told  that eASIC's software will enable a smooth transition from FPGAs to ASICs. As such, Intel is looking to offer an end-to-end solution to customers that begin with FPGAs and finally use ASICs to tackle data-heavy applications in the cloud or aid the deployment of faster wireless networks.The bottom line is that Intel is looking beyond FPGAs to lock in customers from the beginning to the end of the deployment. This is a smart ploy as an integrated solution could help it score more customers over Xilinx despite the technological disadvantage. is  into both PCs and servers, two markets that Intel has traditionally dominated, so Chipzilla needs to find new ways to grow the business, and FPGAs present one such opportunity as they are expected to overtake graphics cards for accelerating AI workloads.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Intel wasn't one of them!

"Tech shares, which have had a tumultuous start to the month, started scaling north following strong quarterly results from  (NASDAQ:  ) among others. While computer and software makers are having a ball owing to the White House's initiative to trim tax rates, high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and automation are driving demand for chips. Source: ShutterstockTech and Internet-related companies are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the latest buyback programs on the back of tax reform and solid cash flow.After all, buybacks boost earnings per share leading to an uptick in the share price. Given such bullishness, investing in some of the biggest and best known Silicon Valley stocks seems judicious. Needless to say, that Silicon Valley is the heart of the technology sector.As tech companies continue to dominate the equity market, total earnings for the sector are up 35% on 12.9% higher revenues in the second quarter, with 89.7% beating earnings estimates and 87.2% trumping revenue estimates.Tech bellwether Apple, in the meantime, became the first U.S. company with a market cap of more than $1 trillion. And it's only after the company reported strong earnings results for the quarter ended Jun 30. It's earnings per share grew 40% year over year and revenues increased 17%.Growth in products including Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats headphones and iPhones helped the Cupertino-based company report stellar numbers. By the way, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is also above Wall Street predictions.In any case, the overall tech sector is expected to notch double-digit gains this earnings season. And if this happens, it would be the fourth successive quarter that the Information Technology sector of the S&P 500 produced earnings growth of 20% or more. Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, had written to investors that ""net buy ratings of major tech players remain extremely high relative to history.""The Republican tax overhaul policy is providing the much-needed windfall to tech companies. The extra cash from tax cuts is helping tech companies pursue merger and acquisition activities. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force for tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest. At the same time, IoT, which connects various devices to the cloud, is expected to be a huge growth driver for tech majors.Chip makers, for now, are making giant strides as chips are in demand for some of the fastest growing tech industries in the world like e-sports and crypto mining. E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, need thousands of semiconductor chips for production. These chips are an essential part of crypto mining as they provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.The latest buzz in the stock market is buybacks.  (NYSE:  ) predicted that stock repurchases will reach $1 trillion this year, up 46% from last year. Buyback authorization, in fact, is expected to surge this month. Goldman added that August typically accounts for 13% of such deals for the year.And tech accounts for the largest share of such buybacks. In the second quarter itself, share repurchases are up 57% from the same period a year earlier, while buybacks in the tech sector surged 130% year over year, per Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Thus, tech stocks are poised to be the biggest beneficiaries of the $1 trillion-buyback bonanza, given many of them are yet to conclude their existing repurchase programs.Investors, thus, should double down on the hottest tech stocks as they continue to scale higher on buybacks, favorable government policies and earnings strength.

hether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Xilinx (XLNX) is headquartered in San Jose, and is in the Computer and Technology sector. The stock has seen a price change of 5.52% since the start of the year. The computer chipmaker is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.36 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.02%. This compares to the Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry's yield of 1.95% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.78%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.44 is up 2.9% from last year. Xilinx has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.74%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Xilinx's current payout ratio is 49%, meaning it paid out 49% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for XLNX for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $2.98 per share, with earnings expected to increase 5.30% from the year ago period.Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that XLNX is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $73.00, changing hands for $74.49/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $67.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $85.00. The standard deviation is $5.727.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $73.00/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $73.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

"emiconductors form the bedrock of the tech sector. Without new chips, data centers couldn't run, cloud services would fail, and the development of consumer electronics would stall out. That's why the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the main benchmark of the growing industry, has more than doubled over the past three years.However, it can be tough for investors to identify decent semiconductor investments beyond market leaders like  and  . So today, let's highlight four other top semiconductor stocks that could deliver big returns.Image source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: CY) is the market leader in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) chips, NOR and SRAM memory chips, USB-C controllers, and auto instrument cluster microcontrollers. Cypress generates most of its revenue from the automotive and industrial IoT markets, and its ""Cypress 3.0"" strategy aims to make the chipmaker a one-stop shop for various IoT needs.The company has three core strengths. First, it dominates niche markets that are largely overlooked by bigger chipmakers. Second, it sells its chips in bundles, which locks in customers and helps it gain content share in cars and industrial machines. Lastly, rising sales of connected cars and the automation of factories should buoy its sales over the long term.Wall Street expects Cypress' revenue to rise 7% this year as its earnings climb 39%. The stock trades at less than 14x forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 2.7%. Those numbers look solid, but the stock remains weighed down by  about China and peaking auto sales. (NASDAQ: TXN) sells a wide variety of analog and embedded chips for automakers, industrial IoT machinery, and consumer electronics. Over the past few years, the company shifted its production from 200mm to 300mm wafers, which cut its average production costs by about 40%. That's how Texas Instruments continually expanded its margins as many other chipmakers struggled.The company has two main strengths. First, its focus on low-end analog and embedded chips keeps its margins high, as the company can avoid direct competition with bigger chipmakers. Second, it's so well diversified that it can easily offset slowdowns in one market (like consumer electronics) with growth in other markets (like connected cars and industrial machines).Analysts expect Texas Instruments' revenue and earnings to rise 7% and 26%, respectively, in 2018. Its stock trades at a reasonable 20x forward earnings, and it pays a forward yield of 2.2%. Shareholders have enjoyed annual payout increases for 14 straight years, which reduced its share count by a whopping 43% during that period.Image source: Getty Images. (NASDAQ: AMD) is the second largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs in the world. It trails Intel and NVIDIA in those markets, respectively, but its chips are still popular with budget OEMs and consumers. AMD also merges its CPU and GPU technologies in single APU chipsets -- which power the PS4, Xbox One, and various gaming laptops.AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which supplies APUs to console makers, often supports its core business if its CPU and GPU sales waver. Instead of staying in the low-end market, AMD is challenging Intel and NVIDIA with higher-end chips. Its Ryzen chips are already  from Intel in desktops, while its new Vega chips won back some market share from NVIDIA during the first quarter, according to research firm JPR.Many tech analysts seem unsure if AMD can keep landing body blows against its larger, more well-heeled rivals. Nonetheless, they still expect revenue to rise 26% this year as its earnings nearly triple. Those are stellar growth rates, even for a stock that trades at about 35x earnings.Back in the 1980s,  (NASDAQ: XLNX) invented a new class of programmable chipsets called FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), which could be reprogrammed after being shipped. Today, Xilinx is the world's top maker of FPGAs, which are used across a wide range of industries. Its only meaningful competitor is Intel, which acquired Xilinx's top competitor Altera in 2015.Xilinx generates its revenue from three core markets -- Communications and Data Center customers; Industrial, Aerospace and Defense customers; and Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive customers. Xilinx's Communications and Data Center market was its weakest one last quarter, but that softness was offset by the double-digit sales growth from the other two segments. Many of its newer chips are used for  tasks.Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue to rise 8% this year, and for its earnings -- which dipped on higher expenses last year -- to grow 38%. Xilinx trades at 24x earnings and pays a forward dividend yield of 2.1%. Investors shouldn't buy a stock based on buyout buzz alone, but Xilinx has often been cited as a  following Intel's takeover of Altera.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Texas Instruments wasn't one of them!

all Street closed in the same fashion as it spent much of Thursday's session: with sharp losses in Facebook (  ) weighing on the Nasdaq Composite and the Standard & Poor's 500, while positive trade sentiment lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The tech sector dropped 1.6% late on the S&P 500, the sharpest decline among the 11 sectors and enough to drag the wider measure into the red, even as most of the groups were gaining. The Nasdaq pulled back from the record high it hit Wednesday, with tech volatility dragging down Amazon.com (  ) ahead of its own earnings release.A consensus between the US and the European Union to work toward zero tariffs bolstered stocks late Wednesday, but that tone was soured by Facebook's after-hours earnings disappointment, which carried over into Thursday's pre-market. The social media giant plunged 19%, and CNBC said the loss of more than $100 billion in value was the biggest one-day rout in US market history.Chipmakers Xilinx (  ), Advanced Micro Devices (  ) and Qualcomm (  ) tried to ease the Nasdaq's pain after their own quarterly earnings reports came in generally above expectations. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) sank 5.7% after Qualcomm said it was ending its bid for the company.On the upside, energy shares rose 1% on gains in crude-oil futures after Saudi Arabia said it was halting shipments through a key tanker waterway amid attacks on two ships in the region. Chevron (CVX) slipped 0.7% and Exxon Mobil (XOM) gained 0.8% ahead of the blue-chips' earnings reports due Friday morning.A slate of economic releases gave clues heading into Friday's advance reading of Q2 gross domestic product growth, which analysts are projecting will come in at 4.2% but President Donald Trump said could be 5%.

"he Q2 earnings cycle is in full swing with a number of semiconductor companies slated to report quarterly numbers over the next few days. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the latest  , technology is one of the six sectors predicted to report double-digit earnings growth this quarter. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 24.5% on 11.4% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies, which still consumes the bulk of the chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (""WSTS""), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.The semiconductor industry is anticipated to continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017 but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $463 billion in 2018, representing growth of 12.4%.The industry is poised to gain from rising demand for new technologies, deployment of 5G broadband technology globally and President Trump's pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company's earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management's ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let's see what's in store for the following semiconductor stocks, all of which are slated to release quarterly figures tomorrow. is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 12 cents per share while the same for revenues is at $1.72 million.

" recently stated its plans to acquire eASIC. Santa Clara, CA-based eASIC is a small company which specializes in customized chip-making technology and has a experience of 19 years in the field. The financial terms were reportedly almost insignificant to the tech giant to be disclosed.Custom-made chips are more efficient but cannot be modified for other purposes. Intel's move to acquire eASIC holds promise in the long haul considering its ambitions of creating a unique and new technology which takes into account both efficiency and flexibility.Post acquisition, eASIC team will join the chipmaker's Programmable Solutions Group (""PSG""). eASIC's structured ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit) microchips will add considerable depth to Intel's programmable solutions portfolio. Improving time-to-market, advanced features and improved performance will be the other positives.Intel's notable economies of scale will enable it to gain an edge in terms of cost, power and extended product life cycles of its offerings.The acquisition is expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2018, after clearing the customary regulations.Notably, Intel's stock has returned 54.9% in the past year, outperforming the  's rally of 52.1%. Intel's bid to enable customers unlock the power of data is a key catalyst.The customers are increasingly handling workloads either over the cloud, Internet of Things (""IoT""), 4G/5G wireless networks, among other emerging platforms. This calls for designing power constrained and high performance applications solutions which customized ASICs offer.Moreover, robust adoption of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) is eventually easing the migration to structured ASICs. Considering the rapid shift to structured ASICs, the company also targets to offer a cost-effective solution that automates the conversion process.In the longer haul, Intel aims to develop advanced programmable chips which ""no one on the marketplace"" offers. The new class of chips will leverage the company's Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (""EMIB"") technology. The new chips will combine Intel's FPGAs with eASIC's structured ASICs in a system to be offered as a package solution.PSG accounted for 3.1% of total revenues in first-quarter 2018. PSG unit started with the $16.5 billion Altera acquisition which the company completed in 2015. The segment reported growth of 17.2% from the year-ago quarter to reach $498 million. Strength in data center and embedded products drove top-line growth.Further, PSG's data center segment soared 150% from the year-ago quarter. Management stated that revenues from advanced FPGA products (28, 20 and 14-nm) grew 40% from the year-ago quarter.After acquiring Altera, Intel has been developing high-end high-performance next-generation 14 nm FPGA chips by using its 14 nm trigate transistor technology. Altera also provides Intel a strategic advantage over Xilinx  regarding its HardCopy offering (a new type of high performance ASIC).The impending new development raises the bar, providing the tech giant a significant edge in the space. Customer base continues to expand as PSG wins more customer designs. Notably, Microsoft  has selected Intel's FPGAs to power new Bing intelligent search features using real-time Artificial Intelligence (""AI"").With the eASIC buyout, Intel will bolster PSG capabilities significantly. The new offerings will provide it a further edge over Xilinix, going forward.In a bid to enhance experience of the clients leveraging critical cloud, edge applications, Intel is aspiring to move beyond providing CPUs. Exploring new end-markets will help the company expand its total addressable market (""TAM"").The buyout highlights the ongoing consolidation in the chip industry. The smaller players bereft of economies of scale resort to being acquired by the big names, as it expands their exposure considerably. We believe the combined technologies complement each other. This deal is a win-win situation for both the parties.While Broadcom's recent proposal to buy CA left a major chunk of analysts confused, Intel's merger with eASIC has clarity and makes sense. The company's move is encouraging and augurs well for the future.Intel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Screen Holdings Co., Ltd  is another stock in the same space, worth considering. It carries the same rank as Intel. The long term earnings of Screen Holdings is pegged at 10%.You can see  .Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

This is just the beginning of a heated M&A race, with all players knowing once-unthinkable partnerships are now going to be permitted.""And so the owners of content look like attractive targets, and  (NYSE:  , NYSE:  ) is high on the list. As Will Healy argued last month, its ownership of Starz, films such as  and TV programs, including  and  for larger distributors.LGF earnings have struggled a bit, and so has LGF stock. Analysts have  of late. And investors likely will need a bit of patience. It seems likely that consolidation, if it comes, won't kick into full gear until  between  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) has completed. But for investors who believe that consolidation is inevitable, LGF's lower valuation and content portfolio make it among the most attractive takeover stocks to buy at the moment.Lions Gate isn't the only potential target, however.  (NASDAQ:  ) is another mid-sized content provider that could provide an attractive consolation prize for acquirers who miss out on the big fish. It also provides a nice 'tuck-in' acquisition for companies looking to expand their reach.AMC owns five networks, including the flagship AMC, along with WE tv, Sundance, BBC America and IFC. Ratings for The Walking Dead have declined of late, but it's still the most-watched program on cable and it has a huge long tail of content licensing revenue ahead. (AMCX owns Dead in full, unlike  and  .)Meanwhile, AMCX is controlled by the Dolan family, who has already sold off Cablevision and reportedly would like to do the same with  (NYSE:  ). And of late, the company has aggressively repurchased shares instead of paying down debt, which suggests at least a possibility that management believes that debt could become someone else's problem.The only concern here is valuation. I sold AMCX on a recent runup near $70, while the stock looks cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, further declines from  can lead earnings south, and even 2018 growth looks relatively muted. With a recent pullback after a big run following the AT&T/Time Warner deal, however, AMCX is starting to drift back to an attractive valuation.Acquisition rumors have swirled around specialty biotech  (NASDAQ:  ) for years now. In fact,  has had it on  .Analysts have become part of the act off and on as well, with speculated acquirers including  (NYSE:  ) and  (OTCMKTS:  ).The M&A case here makes some sense. BioMarin has developed  , including several ""orphan drugs"", as well as potentially valuable  for hemophilia. 2018 revenue should be in the range of $1.5 billion, but BioMarin continues to post losses, which is one reason why the stock has flat-lined the past few years.A larger acquirer could add growth from BioMarin's drugs and cut costs to turn the company profitable. The big concern is valuation, particularly after a 30% run off of April lows. Still, at some point, the long-awaited sale of BioMarin appears likely. And even just below $100, there's still more upside to come in that scenario.Aircraft parts manufacturer  (NYSE:  ) has been a subject of takeover speculation ever since it split from  (NYSE:  ). An activist stake owned by Elliott Management, whose strategies generally center on a near-term sale, only added to the frenzy. CNBC's Jim Cramer argued last year that  (NYSE:  ) was  , after  (NYSE:  )  (NYSE:  ).That speculation has been paused, however, as Arconic's performance has hit the skids. The stock plunged in late April after cutting its full-year outlook. Higher aluminum costs are hitting margins (and somewhat ironically benefiting the Alcoa unit that supposedly was hiding Arconic's true potential). Production missteps under Elliott's new, hand-picked CEO have only added to the pressure.Still, at some point, Arconic seems likely to return to being one of the most talked-about takeover stocks. It will take some time for the company to work through near-term issues. But with end demand from  (NYSE:  ) strong and likely to stay the way, and consolidation in the space inevitable, Arconic very well may be acquired sooner than many investors currently believe.There are three key reasons why chipmaker  (NASDAQ:  ) is a likely acquisition target. The first is that the chip space in general is performing well and optimism toward the future is rising. With trends like IoT (Internet of Things) providing tailwinds, there's an increasing belief that the old, more cyclical, nature of the space is starting to fade.Secondly, Xilinx looks like a strong play on one of the bigger trends: artificial intelligence. Its FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are  . Indeed, the company  in May.And, third, there's a logical acquirer here in  (NASDAQ:  ). Even before Broadcom's bid to buy  (NASDAQ:  ) fell through, XLNX was  for that always-acquisitive company. With Broadcom now U.S.-based, and with plenty of dry powder, such a deal makes even more sense at the moment. With XLNX lagging the chip space - it has gained less than 5% over the past year - despite strong earnings, the valuation looks workable as well. (NASDAQ:  ) is another target for Broadcom or another large semiconductor company. Indeed, speculation has swirled for some time. Rumors of interest from Japan's  (OTCMKTS:  ) spiked MXIM stock in January, but the rumor was quickly shot down. Back in 2015, sources said Maxim held talks with  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).In both cases, price was a reported issue, and that still may be the case. At 21x forward earnings, MXIM stock isn't exactly cheap. But a takeover at some point does seem possible, if not necessarily likely. And in the meantime, investors can receive a 2.8% dividend yield as they wait. (NASDAQ:  ) is not a stock for the faint of heart. Execution missteps and weak demand have led MAT stock to drop by about 62% over the past five years, and 32% over the past three, even with a recent rally. The  with Disney to rival  (NASDAQ:  ) has only added to the pressure.Indeed, I don't see MAT as a buy, particularly after gains over the past couple of months. I argued a year ago that  (when it traded above current levels) and  .But Mattel appears to have entered the realm of takeover stocks, and with some reason. Hasbro could be a suitor, although antitrust concerns are an issue. The company itself said it had  from MGA Entertainment in May.The huge amount of debt is a big problem, as markets are valuing that debt as low as 82 cents on the dollar, making it less likely that an acquirer would want to pay par and provide a premium to equity owners. Still, rumors continue to swirl, and if Mattel can make some progress on its turnaround, the calls for a sale likely will only get louder. (NYSE:  ) is in an interesting spot at the moment. The open-source software developer unquestionably has  . But it's also coming off  that sent RHT stock plunging.Even after the losses, RHT still isn't cheap.Yet takeover speculation has continued, with recent rumors suggesting  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  )  as it builds out its cloud business. Any interest could start a bidding war, with other tech giants including  (NASDAQ:  ) perhaps becoming interested.Whether there's room for more premium is unclear, with RHT still trading at a dear 34x+ forward P/E multiple. But given its growth potential and importance in such a key space, Red Hat could become a target at any time.Grocery stocks have struggled for the past year, ever since Amazon  of Whole Foods Market. And with the industry's majors looking to increase scale and stand out from the crowd,  (NASDAQ:  ) seems like an intriguing target.Analysts have  . And indeed, Sprouts itself has taken steps down that path. Its CEO said in December that Sprouts was  . It held talks with Albertsons early last year, though after they fell through, that giant instead  with  (NYSE:  ).  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) all potentially make sense as buyers.The concern is that - like many of these takeover stocks - some M&A premium is already priced in. And SFM did fall hard after  in early May. But the stock has regained most of those losses, and it has held up despite the pressure on the space. That's likely because the market believes that at some point, a buyout offer will come along.Drone manufacturer  (NASDAQ:  ) has been a logical M&A target going back to the last decade. Longstanding relationships with the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense, along with a generally heavy cost structure, theoretically made AVAV a natural target for a major defense contractor like  (NYSE:  ) or  (NYSE:  ).But the recent gains in AVAV stock, which has tripled from late 2016 lows, are coming from improvements in the business, not takeover speculation. Margins are improving. AeroVironment has two key opportunities in commercial applications (notably for agricultural use) and a joint venture with  (OTCMKTS:  ) to offer 5G wireless from high-altitude drones.Still, there's a potential M&A case here, with the only concern being its valuation. AVAV looks awfully stretched from here, trading at ~45x forward earnings. There are a lot of costs to cut, but it remains to be seen if the savings, and the potential growth, are large enough to justify more gains for AVAV.Chemical producer  (NYSE:  ) doesn't get a lot of attention from investors, despite a $5 billion market cap. But there is increasing belief that Grace could be a takeover target relatively soon.In April,  surrounding a  (NYSE:  ) bid sent GRA shares up over 6%. Before that, RBC cited the company as  . And the 2016 spin-off of  (NYSE:  ) made a potential sale easier, as Grace's CFO  .In the meantime, GRA still looks reasonably attractive. Despite a sharp rebound from early April lows, GRA trades at a still-reasonable 17x forward earnings. Chemical production  . GRA doesn't look like a bad stock on its own, and a buyout from Honeywell, or another acquirer, could create real upside.There are few, if any, companies that have been takeover stocks longer than optical networking provider  (NYSE:  ). Investors were looking for a Ciena buyout  . In 2010,  (NYSE:  )  . Two years ago,  from  (NASDAQ:  ), which was supposed to buy the company  .More recent speculation names  (NASDAQ:  ) as  . And several firms, including Morgan Stanley, have added CIEN to their list of takeover stocks.Will this time be different? Possibly. But in the meantime, Ciena has a healthy balance sheet, a focus on margin expansion, and a reasonable valuation. Even if a takeover doesn't (finally) materialize, there could be some value left in CIEN stock. (NYSE:  ) seems like a classic takeout candidate. It's disrupting a payment space largely led by giants. The business could benefit from increased scale, and an acquirer could gain from lower sales and marketing spend.The only question at this point is whether SQ stock is too expensive. I've long been  , but so far, I've been completely wrong.In my defense, I'm not alone. At $65, SQ stock is well ahead of the consensus Wall Street target of $57. And at nearly 10x revenue, there's a question as to whether the valuation can support anything left in the way of premium. Companies like  (NASDAQ:  ) and even  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) could be logical suitors. But can they - and will they - pay what Square shareholders would ask for?Just a few years ago, beverage maker  (NASDAQ:  ) was a sleepy producer of smaller soft drink brands. But the company's LaCroix sparkling water brand took off, and so did FIZZ stock. It has risen 484% in the past five years alone.Along with that increased valuation has come increased attention. Short sellers have targeted FIZZ stock. And rumors of a takeover have only amplified.After all, LaCroix looks like a big winner. It has massive market share in sparkling water, a category that is taking share from diet soda (and regular soda as well). Quirky branding, design and marketing has garnered the label a cult following.And so an acquisition makes sense - if one of the majors can't undercut the LaCroix business.  (NASDAQ:  ) is trying to do so with  .  (NYSE:  ) has rolled out Dasani sparkling water and  . But if LaCroix continues its dominance, Pepsi or Coke may simply decide to buy out National Beverage. Acquisitive  (NYSE:  ) could be in the mix as well.The rumor mill is as hot around  (NYSE:  ) as any of the takeover stocks right now. In May, disappointing numbers and  sent CPB stock to its lowest levels in nearly five years. But reports that  (NASDAQ:  ) is  have sent CPB shares soaring.From here, the logic of a Kraft-Campbell's tie-up seems minimal. Adding one zero-growth, indebted manufacturer to another doesn't seem like an attractive combination. But at the least, it does seem like CPB's family ownership group is accepting the need for a sale. And with activist pressure helping, that could lead to a buyout, whether by Kraft or by someone else.A common trend in the food industry the last few years has been for larger companies to buy smaller, faster-growing brands in the natural and organic spaces. But  (NASDAQ:  ) seems to have missed out.Over the past few years, Hain has been cited as a possible target for a number of companies, including Kraft Heinz, Campbell's and  (NYSE:  ). But a somewhat unwieldy portfolio, which includes personal care, meats and snacks, has made a straight sale difficult. In the meantime, HAIN stock has taken a big hit, touching a six-year low in late May before a recent rebound.But a sale finally may be on the way. An  and is pushing for a sale. HAIN probably won't get a price close to its peak, and it may have to break itself up to create incremental value for existing shareholders. There is some value here, however, and a clear motivation to - finally - get a deal done.Takeover speculation has ramped up around  (NASDAQ:  ) this year. Once founder Steve Wynn  in February, the path to a sale actually became a bit clearer.Rival  (NYSE:  ) seemed like the most logical acquirer. Rumors followed in April that  (NYSE:  ) was  .And with WYNN pulling back over the past few weeks, largely due to concerns surrounding its operations in Macau, the case for a takeout looks stronger. U.S. casinos have been in full-out M&A mode, with  (NASDAQ:  ) buying up Isle of Capri and other assets and  (NASDAQ:  ) merging with  (NASDAQ:  ), among many other moves. Similar logic would work for a takeout of Wynn.The logic of a deal doesn't necessarily mean one is on the way. But one way for Wynn Resorts to get a truly fresh start would be to find a different owner.Discovered almost by accident, Louis Navellier's incredible trading breakthrough has delivered 148 double- and triple-digit winners over the past 5 years - including a stunning 487% win in just 10 months.Learn to use this formula and you can start turning every $10,000 invested  . to review Louis' urgent presentation.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@18 Stocks That Could Be Takeover Targets@2018-07-10@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/18-stocks-that-could-be-takeover-targets-2018-07-10

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Shareholder Yield Fund ETF (Symbol: QSY), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $90.60 per unit.With QSY trading at a recent price near $82.44 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.91% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QSY's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Allison Transmission Holdings Inc (Symbol: ALSN), Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX), and Valero Energy Corp (Symbol: VLO). Although ALSN has traded at a recent price of $40.40/share, the average analyst target is 11.66% higher at $45.11/share. Similarly, XLNX has 11.10% upside from the recent share price of $65.48 if the average analyst target price of $72.75/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting VLO to reach a target price of $120.83/share, which is 10.59% above the recent price of $109.26.

" has been gaining on a steady demand in the communications industry, and continued adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.9%.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.3% and a current market cap of $16.8 billion, it seems to be a stock that investors should retain in their portfolio right now.Let's take a look at the factors aiding the company's performance.Xilinx, a designer and manufacturer of a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs), is witnessing impressive growth of its 16-nm, 20-nm and 28-nm products.The company's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. This is also helping Xilinx counter the stiff competition from the likes of Intel  .Moreover, the increasing demand for the company's Ultrascale+ FPGAs from data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service looks promising, with the client base already having prominent names like Amazon  and Alibaba  .We believe Xilinx is poised to tap the opportunities stemming from an increase in adoption of AI technologies, 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles and IoTs, which will drive its revenue growth over the long run. | However, the company is plagued with certain headwinds in one of its largest markets - the Asia Pacific having sluggish wireless deployments. This, in turn, might be a drag on the company's near-term results.Additionally, intensifying competition from Intel is a negative for Xilinx. Notably, Intel has become an even stronger competitor after the acquisition of Altera in 2015 and made it difficult for Xilinx to gambit the duo's combined initiatives.Moreover, Xilinx keeps on innovating for producing advanced FPGAs of lower geometries to improve performance, density and system-level functionality, integration, and lower cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. With each transition to a new process node, there are considerable tape-out costs, the need to navigate the learning curve and limited volume production, which are all significant headwinds for margins and profitability.Nevertheless, a favorable product mix, along with a satisfactory guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2019, keeps us hopeful about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock's retention in investors' portfolio.You can see  .Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

emand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is going to go through the roof in the coming years. Allied Market Research estimates that AI chip demand could increase at almost 50% a year through the next five years, as this technology gains adoption across several verticals ranging from automotive to healthcare. (NASDAQ: XLNX) is well aware of this massive opportunity, which is why AI-focused development was a common theme at its recent analyst day. The company has already taken its first steps in the AI space with the help of its  (FPGAs), but it's now looking to raise its game by going all in on product development.Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx has been stepping up its research and development (R&D) efforts over the past few years. It spent around a quarter of its revenue on R&D last year, up from 20% four years ago. In fact, the chipmaker's R&D expenses have been growing at a faster pace than its top line for three years now. data by  .This trend is expected to continue in the new fiscal year, as Xilinx plans to increase its operating expenses nearly 10% in fiscal year 2019, which will be identical to its revenue growth. Quite clearly, Xilinx isn't focusing on boosting profitability right now; it's looking to accelerate its product roadmap to deliver more efficient chips.The majority of the company's chips are currently based on the 28-nanometer (nm) and 20nm platforms, but it is planning to move to the more efficient 16nm and 7nm nodes. Chips manufactured using smaller nodes are more efficient because they can deliver more performance for each watt of power consumed. Additionally, they tend to have lower manufacturing costs, since the chipmaker can manufacture more integrated circuits from each wafer.As such, Xilinx's manufacturing costs should come down once it starts mass production of such chips, leading to greater profitability. But this is just one side of the coin; making FPGAs using a more advanced manufacturing process should help Xilinx tap the lucrative AI market.Xilinx has set its sights on the data center space, which is going to witness a massive spurt in demand for AI chips, as the cloud is going to handle the majority of AI workloads. In fact, Xilinx estimates that demand for data center chips will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 67% over the next five years, hitting $4.6 billion in value, which is nearly double Xilinx's annual revenue.Chips needed to compute AI workloads will account for the majority of this end market, which is why Xilinx is busy rolling out its 7nm-based Everest chips. Xilinx claims that these chips can compute AI workloads at least 20 times faster than its current 16nm chips. The company has started testing the new chips with select customers, and plans to start shipping them in 2019.This sets Xilinx on its way to gain ground on archrival  , which has  . Chipzilla will remain stuck with the current 14nm process for the foreseeable future, so Xilinx should be able to consolidate its FPGA lead. As it turns out, Xilinx already enjoys a strong technology lead over Intel, which is why it controls  of the FPGA market.Allied Market Research estimates that FPGAs will be the fastest-growing sub-segment in AI chips, outpacing even graphics cards from the likes of  . This is because the flexible architecture of FPGAs means they  by developers for other tasks.Moreover, compared to power-hungry graphics cards, FPGAs are power-efficient. This means they're more suitable for deployment in large-scale scenarios, such as servers, where keeping energy consumption low is key. Not surprisingly, several cloud service providers have started deploying FPGAs in the cloud. , for instance, partnered with Xilinx late last year to deliver an FPGA-based cloud computing instance. But this isn't the only big cloud partnership that the chipmaker boasts.  and  have also selected Xilinx FPGAs to accelerate their cloud services.Xilinx's revenue growth hasn't been very attractive over the past few years, but that was before the AI use cases for FPGAs emerged. Cloud service providers are using these chips now, and with promised technological advancements from Xilinx, it won't be surprising if they gain broader adoption to facilitate AI deployments.Once that happens, Xilinx's expenses should come down as a percentage of total revenue, boosting its earnings. This is probably why analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at a CAGR of nearly 12% over the next five years, well ahead of the 4% annual bottom-line growth it has clocked over the past half-decade.The opportunity it faces and a forward P/E of 24 compared to the industry average of 30 make this stock a smart bet.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

"nvestors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options begin trading today, for the July 6th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new July 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $68.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $68.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $66.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $68.59/share today.Because the $68.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

 is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25.Earlier this month, CBS Corp (CBS) offered a below market bid for Viacom, which was immediately rejected. The CBS offer of 0.55 shares for each Viacom class B share failed to impress the owner of Nickelodeon and MTV networks.The company believes a market price of 0.62 is suitable. Notably, it expects cost synergy of $1 billion from the merger.Notably, Viacom beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.09%. In the last reported quarter, the company's adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. | Viacom's top-line has also beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, revenues came in at $3.07 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 billion and decreased 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Shares of Viacom have lost 0.4% on a year-to-date basis as compared with the  's decline of 2.5%. The decline can be attributed to the ongoing scuffle over the merger with CBS.Moreover, growth projections are muted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings of 80 cents per share represents a year-over-year increase of 1.3%. However, the consensus sales expectations for the second quarter stand at $3.03 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 6.91%.Viacom is likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States owing to loss of subscribers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2018 affiliate revenues is pegged at $1.14 billion, unchanged on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, management expects domestic ad revenues to improve sequentially in the second quarter. Ratings improvement, new original programming content, greater carriage benefits from improved distributor penetration and higher contribution from digital initiatives are key catalysts.However, the company's performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better driven by expanding market share in Latin America and India.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive  has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Viacom has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.77%, which indicates a likely positive surprise.

 is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25.In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9.79%, beating estimates in each. In the last reported quarter, the company's adjusted earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Moreover, Comcast's top-line has beaten the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters. In the last-quarter, revenues came in at $21.92 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.80 billion and increased 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Comcast has completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand. Based on a Mobile Virtual Network Operator agreement with Verizon, Xfinity Mobile uses Verizon's 4G LTE wireless network. | Comcast continues to add new features like the voice remote (more than 20 million currently deployed) and has integrated YouTube, Pandora and iHeartRadio. These features are likely to improve customer engagement, consequently benefiting top-line growth.Moreover, the company continues to roll out xFi pod extenders to increased Wi-Fi coverage in the home and its xFi app, which offers an unrivaled level of control. Increasing demand for high-speed internet presents significant growth opportunity for Comcast. The company's broadband penetration currently stands at 45%.Business Services have been witnessing strong momentum and continue to present attractive growth prospects. Comcast has started deploying fiber-based 2 Gbps residential broadband Internet services in certain regions. Known as Gigabit Pro, this new service runs on FTTH technology.Comcast Business has also announced the launch of DOCSIS 3.1-based internet service to business customers.Moreover, Comcast's strategy of consistent investment in new attractions at the company's theme parks is expected to drive growth for NBCUniversal in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain concerned about the company's operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Comcast lost 33,000 video customers and 13,000 voice customers in the fourth-quarter 2017, due to cord-cutting and stiff competition.Additionally, we view the company's high-debt levels and consolidation-related woes as potential hazards.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive  has a good chance of beating estimates.

In the last quarter, revenues came in at $1.94 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 billion and increased 17.6% from the year-ago quarter.Management anticipates first-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.78 billion and $1.82 billion, while adjusted earnings between 78 cents and 80 cents per share. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Amphenol's top-line growth is benefiting from improved end-market demand, new product rollouts and market share gains. Demand continues to be strong in automotive, industrial and military markets.However, management expects sales in the military market to moderate from fourth-quarter level (up 11% year-over-year).Moreover, Amphenol remains encouraged by expanding presence in the fast-growing commercial aerospace market. The company is well positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content in next-generation planes. These advanced electronic systems require new advanced technology interconnect solutions to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience, all of which create excellent opportunities for the company.Nevertheless, sales in the commercial aerospace market is expected moderate (low single digit growth against 11% in the fourth-quarter) as helicopter and business jet procurement volume stabilize and as commercial jetliner production continues to grow moderately.Further, the latest acquisition of Canada-based CTI Industries that manufactures high technology cable assemblies diversifies Ampehenol's interconnect product portfolio, which will drive industrial market top-line growth. However, sales in the industrial market are also expected to moderate in the first quarter.Automotive growth is anticipated to be sustained by a robust product portfolio. The company's expanding range of interconnect sensor and antenna products are expected to drive sales.Further, the latest acquisition of China-based Sunpool, a provider of high technology antennas for the Chinese automotive market, solidifies the company's market position.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive  has a good chance of beating estimates.

" is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. Notably, F5 Networks has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company's results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, came in line in another and missed in the other. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.2%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Our proven model shows that F5 Networks is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .F5 Networks carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.27%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.26, which indicates a 15.9% year-over-year increase. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $529 million, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter. | F5 Networks is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growth prospects of the application-networking market as enterprises cope with the rapidly increasing capacity and security demands of next-generation applications and architectures. The company enjoys a strong foothold in the Layer 4-7 content switching market.Furthermore, during the fiscal first-quarter conference call, F5 Networks' management was optimistic about the deployment of solutions by customers on cloud and on-premise environment, which is expected to drive near-term revenues.Additionally, the company is also taking steps to address the rising need of multi-cloud environment and better scaling of applications in an era where organizations are taking up digital transformation at an accelerated pace. To meet the requirement of the ""per application based cloud decision"" of companies, F5 Networks came up with per application VE solutions in the fiscal first quarter. These offerings are meant to support web-application firewall and management of traffic. The benefits from these moves will likely positively impact F5 Networks' fiscal second-quarter results.We believe the company's recently-launched iSeries platform, which is useful for new age applications such as Internet of Things, will have attracted new customers, thereby boosting its top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Western Digital Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.30% and a Zacks Rank #1.

 is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26. The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Western Digital surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.Due to expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital's prospects look bright. Additionally, the company's expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data, growing exposure to the SMB space and positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition are likely to act as catalysts for Q3 results.Our proven model shows that Western Digital is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Western Digital flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1 and has an Earnings ESP of 2.30%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.27, indicating an increase of 36.8% from the year-ago quarter's figure. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up by a penny over the past seven days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $4.93 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter. | Western Digital has been expanding in the SSD storage market, bothered by the declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices over the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs.Over the last few months, the company rolled out the world's smallest 1 TB USB flash drive, voice activated media streaming via home devices, and a new series of high performance SSDs. With the rising need to capture and share rich content, lens technology and video streaming are becoming more immersive.For photographers and drone enthusiasts, the company also released My Passport Wireless SSD and SanDisk Extreme portable SSD. These devices feature a one-touch card copy that enables quick editing, as well as third-party app integration.Western Digital also unveiled the My Cloud Home device that displays new voice-activated media streaming features through smart-home devices.These product additions will enhance the company's existing product portfolio and aid Western Digital in gaining a strong foothold in the global SSD market, which, per the latest data by TechNavio, is expected to witness CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020.Anticipating a potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is also investing heavily to deliver high-capacity storage devices which will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications.The company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, a broader portfolio of network attached storage (NAS) hard drives. My Cloud EX4 will help the company meet growing business needs, with improved flexibility and security, consequently boosting its top line.The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind. Further, the company's expanding footprint in the automotive, as well as the connected home and industrial categories are likely to act as another key catalyst.Furthermore, Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company's growth and helped it gain traction in SSD. Additionally, it has enabled the company to step into the NAND products market which, owing to its strong demand, will drive revenues.Moreover, the company's acquisitions of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio as well.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Xilinx, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +5.26% and a Zacks Rank #2.

" is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 25. Notably, the stock has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9% in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 20.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 68 cents per share, indicating a 19.3% increase on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to be around $649.54 million, indicating a 6.6% increase from the year-ago quarter.The increasing demand for Xilinx's high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices will prove to be beneficial for the company's top line. We believe that Xilinx is well positioned to tap the opportunities arising from an increase in adoption of AI technologies, 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles and IoTs.Notably, Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel  .During the soon-to-be-reported quarter, Xilinx unveiled ""automotive qualified Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC family"", aimed at assisting the development of safe advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems.The company also partnered with Barefoot Networks in the fourth quarter for the development of solutions that will monitor the performance of an end-to-end network, targeting 5G networks.Notably, the fourth-quarter results will be the first after a change in leadership, with Moshe Gavrielov announcing his retirement and Victor Peng taking over as the CEO of the company. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $15.05 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 1.7%.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings is pegged at 71 cents per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.6%. | Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Intel's focus on data center, cloud, self-driving car and Internet of Things (IoT) are key growth drivers for the first quarter. Management expects data-centric part of the business to grow in the mid-teens range, while PC centric to decline in low-single digits.Apart from strong on-going demand for public clouds, the company is also expected to benefit from strength in on-premise and hybrid cloud build-outs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Data Center Group (""DCG"") currently stands at $4.82 billion higher than $4.23 billion in the year-ago quarter.Intel's data center business and cloud have been registering strong growth in the last few quarters. The company has made significant advancement in this area as well and it is now offering more integrated solutions that are likely to be competitive on a cost per watt basis.The company's investments in field programmable gate array (FPGA) for acceleration (dramatically increases performances at very low power) and memory to reduce latency and increase speeds are helping it develop custom solutions for big players.Moreover, Intel's acquisition of MobilEye now enables it to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles - cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management. The buyout enables the company rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIA.Intel has also been a long-time supplier to Alphabet's Waymo division.

Some of the biggest tech names are slated to report earnings this week. These results come at a time when the technology sector is grappling with several crises which have sprung up at short intervals. Of the companies, slated to report earnings this week,  (NASDAQ:  ) has had to battle the fallout of a data leak scandal. Meanwhile,  (NASDAQ:  ) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump. Source: ShutterstockGiven this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover. Only recently, poor guidance from  (NYSE:  ) pulled down other tech majors like  (NASDAQ:  ).But not all the worries the sector faces at the moment could snowball into threats of significant proportions. For instance, most market watchers believe that a divided Congress is unlikely to regulate data gathering of the kind practiced by Facebook or Google. Online advertising spends, therefore, are likely to remain largely unchanged.However, higher user engagement will still be topmost on the list of investor priorities. Ultimately, earnings would not only have to be good overall. They would have to be strong enough to outweigh recent sector concerns.Unlike the Finance sector whose earnings performance notably improved this earnings season compared to other recent periods, the Tech sector's earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters. This strength is expected to continue in the Q1 earnings season as well.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter.That's head and shoulders above the autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 18% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.Tech stocks have been battered on several fronts this year, the latest being poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor. However, several of the concerns surrounding the sector are unlikely to build up into something larger.For instance, U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to impose stringent regulation on tech majors in the near term. Meanwhile, in keeping with stellar fourth-quarter results, first-quarter numbers are likely to be impressive. is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

" month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 8.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is XLNX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Xilinx reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP earnings of 64 cents per share, marking year-over year growth of 12.3%. Excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, earnings per share came in at 77 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 66 cents.Revenues for the quarter came in at $672.9 million, which is above the mid-point of its guided range of $635-$665 million (mid-point $650 million). The revenue figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650 million as well.Management noted that Xilinx's revenues recorded growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company's 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped 28% year over year and 7% sequentially. We note that the segment's contribution to total revenues was 57%, a significant increase from 49% in the year-ago quarter and 56% reported in the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was chiefly driven by solid demand for its Zynq SoC platform, and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 60% year-over-year growth, backed by robust demand in all of the company's end markets i.e. automotive, industrial, aerospace and defense, communication and consumer.The 20-nm sales soared 50% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets. However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter.Revenues from core products declined 6% from the year-earlier quarter. However, the revenue figure increased 6%, sequentially.On basis of the end market, Communications & Data-Center segment revenues (34% of total revenues) dipped 8% year over year, but grew 2% sequentially. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (48% of total revenues) climbed 25% on a year-over-year basis and 10% on a sequential basis. The Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenues) ascended 17% year over year, but declined 7% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific were up 10%, 26%, 17% and 2%, respectively. Sequentially, North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific registered increase of 5%, 20%, 7% and 1%, respectively.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel. The company's Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm nodes, delivered sturdy top-line growth in the quarter.Management is also optimistic over the demand of its Ultrascale+ FPGAs data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service. Amazon was the first to use Xilinx chips, and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017.Since then, the company has got five contracts for FPGA-as-a-Service deployments, which, however, haven't come online yet. The list, which includes companies like Alibaba, is in the process to deploy two generations of FPGA-as-a-Service by using Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGA chips.Furthermore, the company recently rolled out a product category - Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) - under its Everest project. Under this project, Xilinx ""will deliver the industry's first 7-nanometer ACAP product family."" The company expects to tape-out its first ACAP product this year.Gross margin expanded 120 basis points (bps) year over year to 70.7%, and came in above the mid-point of the company's guided range of 69-71% (mid-point 70%).Operating expenses flared up 14.2% year over year to $285.8 million. However, excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, operating expenses came in at $252.4 million, lower than management's expectations of $255 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses (excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition) amounted to 37.5%, reflecting 360-bps contraction, on a year-over-year basis.Reduced operating expenses (excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition) as a percentage of revenues, along with healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulted in year-over-year expansion of 470 bps in operating margin, which came in at 33.2%. Additionally, we note that the company registered more than 30% of operating margin for the second consecutive quarter.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $189.8 million, up 9.4% year over year. Excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, operating income was up 28.7% year over year to $223.1 million.Xilinx exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.45 billion compared with $3.54 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.21 billion, down from $1.73 billion reported in the previous quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $217.7 million from operations and incurred $21 million as capital expenditure during the fiscal fourth quarter. The company paid $89.3 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $163.4 million.In fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $795.5 million from operations and incurred $49.9 million as capital expenditure. It paid $353.1 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares for $474.3 million.For first-quarter fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $660-$690 million (mid-point $675 million). The mid-point of the company's guided range is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $664.7 million.Management predicts the Advanced Products segment to record growth. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive end markets to improve year over year. On the other hand, the communication and data-center end market is estimated to register year-over-year decline.Gross margin is expected between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are projected at $260 million. Tax rate is estimated between 10% and 14%.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions higher for the current quarter | At this time, XLNX has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 66 cents.Revenues for the quarter came in at $672.9 million, which is above the mid-point of its guided range of $635-$665 million (mid-point $650 million). The revenue figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650 million as well.Investors' optimism in the stock has been mainly boosted by some of Xilinx's accomplishments. Record sales figure, marking the tenth straight quarter of growth, as well as more than 30% of operating margin (excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition) for the second consecutive quarter, were the highlights of this season. Also, during the fiscal, the company achieved its annual revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion.Apart from this, better-than-expected sales view for the forthcoming quarter also boosted investor confidence. Xilinx's shares gained nearly 6% during yesterday's after-hour trade. | Management noted that Xilinx's revenues recorded growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company's 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped 28% year over year and 7% sequentially. We note that the segment's contribution to total revenues was 57%, a significant increase from 49% in the year-ago quarter and 56% reported in the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was chiefly driven by solid demand for its Zynq SoC platform, and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 60% year-over-year growth, backed by robust demand in all of the company's end markets i.e. automotive, industrial, aerospace and defense, communication and consumer.The 20-nm sales soared 50% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets. However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter.Revenues from core products declined 6% from the year-earlier quarter. However, the revenue figure increased 6%, sequentially.On basis of the end market, Communications & Data-Center segment revenues (34% of total revenues) dipped 8% year over year, but grew 2% sequentially. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (48% of total revenues) climbed 25% on a year-over-year basis and 10% on a sequential basis. The Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenues) ascended 17% year over year, but declined 7% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific were up 10%, 26%, 17% and 2%, respectively. Sequentially, North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific registered increase of 5%, 20%, 7% and 1%, respectively.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel  . The company's Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm nodes, delivered sturdy top-line growth in the quarter.Management is also optimistic over the demand of its Ultrascale+ FPGAs data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service. Amazon  was the first to use Xilinx chips, and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017.Since then, the company has got five contracts for FPGA-as-a-Service deployments, which, however, haven't come online yet. The list, which includes companies like Alibaba  , is in the process to deploy two generations of FPGA-as-a-Service by using Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGA chips.Furthermore, the company recently rolled out a product category - Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) - under its Everest project. Under this project, Xilinx ""will deliver the industry's first 7-nanometer ACAP product family."" The company expects to tape-out its first ACAP product this year.Gross margin expanded 120 basis points (bps) year over year to 70.7%, and came in above the mid-point of the company's guided range of 69-71% (mid-point 70%).Operating expenses flared up 14.2% year over year to $285.8 million. However, excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, operating expenses came in at $252.4 million, lower than management's expectations of $255 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses (excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition) amounted to 37.5%, reflecting 360-bps contraction, on a year-over-year basis.Reduced operating expenses (excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition) as a percentage of revenues, along with healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulted in year-over-year expansion of 470 bps in operating margin, which came in at 33.2%. Additionally, we note that the company registered more than 30% of operating margin for the second consecutive quarter.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $189.8 million, up 9.4% year over year. Excluding the unusual one-time cost related to executive transition, operating income was up 28.7% year over year to $223.1 million.Xilinx exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.45 billion compared with $3.54 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.21 billion, down from $1.73 billion reported in the previous quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $217.7 million from operations and incurred $21 million as capital expenditure during the fiscal fourth quarter. The company paid $89.3 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $163.4 million.In fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $795.5 million from operations and incurred $49.9 million as capital expenditure. It paid $353.1 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares for $474.3 million.For first-quarter fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $660-$690 million (mid-point $675 million). The mid-point of the company's guided range is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $664.7 million.Management predicts the Advanced Products segment to record growth. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive end markets to improve year over year. On the other hand, the communication and data-center end market is estimated to register year-over-year decline.Gross margin is expected between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are projected at $260 million. Tax rate is estimated between 10% and 14%.Xilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of the FPGA replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company's revenues throughout fiscal 2019, aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors, such as wired communication, data center and industrial, will stoke revenue growth.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior.Most of the emerging economies are witnessing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in the Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will spur demand for Xilinx's 16-nm, 20-nm and 28-nm nodes, thereby positively influencing its overall financial performance for the next few quarters.Currently, Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

"When most investors think of artificial intelligence stocks, names like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) come to mind - and well they should.Nvidia's graphics processing hardware has proven an ideal way to complete the intensive number-crunching required by most AI applications, and Microsoft has arguably  , garnering some new and impressive technologies it has yet to turn into a practical product. Those products are in the works, though.Many more organizations have waded into artificial intelligence waters, however - more than you might realize. A bunch of them are smaller and, perhaps, even unknown names. That doesn't make them inferior AI stocks, however. Indeed, many of these unknown names rank among the best artificial intelligence stocks available to investors today.With that as the backdrop, here's a run-down of three AI names you may not have realized were artificial intelligence plays - if you realized they existed at all. (NASDAQ:  ) isn't exactly off the radar. On the other hand, with a modest market cap of $17 billion, it's not exactly turning a lot of heads either.Give it time, though.Xilinx, for the unfamiliar, makes a variety of technologies that connect (usually) dissimilar things. That can mean a lot, of course, but Xilinx does a lot of different things. Its big claim to fame within the world of AI stocks is the development of high-performance  , or Field Programmable Gate Arrays.FPGAs can be, as the name suggests, programmed and reprogrammed on the fly by a coder that needs a device to do something not previously foreseen. That's in contrast with ASIC chips, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, which can only be programmed once at the time as they're being manufactured.It seems like a minor benefit, but the flexibility of FPGAs has proven indispensable in many machine-learning environments, and  .It's not the high-end artificial applications like self-driving vehicles. Rather, much of Xilinx's wares are the low-brow stuff, like managing sensors that make Internet of Things networks work as they should. That's where the tangible, practical opportunity is though. (NASDAQ:  )? The same Baidu that's usually described as the ""Google of China"" is also an artificial intelligence stock? Yep. In fact, it may quietly be one of the best artificial intelligence stocks one can own.To be clear, AI is still a very small sliver of what the company does. Its meat-and-potatoes business is still advertising revenue generated operating China's preferred search engine. Just like its western counterpart, though, it's branching out into other opportunities, knowing there will come a time when online ads are no longer a growth engine.That said, Baidu CEO Robin Li has made no bones about it: Baidu is now an AI-first company, whatever that ends up meaning.One such practical (even if bold) effort is the development of an  . Called Apollo, the platform's openness to all developers and tweaks has proven popular with potential partners. In the meantime, Baidu has created some more practical artificial intelligence tools like a  Yes, it's akin to the Echo from  (NASDAQ:  ). The underlying technology powering the Little Fish holds tremendous promise as the digital backbone for a whole host of IoT devices.Last, but certainly not least, put  (NYSE:  ) on your list of artificial intelligence stocks worth a look.The short version of a long story: While many AI developers are proverbially swinging for the fences in hopes of a payoff down the road, Yext is creating practical AI-driven services here and now. Specifically, Yext has developed ways to turn the mountains of data most companies are now collecting  .At first glance, it might not even look like true artificial intelligence. It may look and feel more like a well-planned means of repackaging information that already exists in a difficult-to-use format. Take a closer look, though, and one can see that its   and its  for use by client companies wouldn't function properly just using a mere script. Not in the least.

ome of the biggest tech names are slated to report earnings this week. These results come at a time when the technology sector is grappling with several crises which have sprung up at short intervals. Of the companies, slated to report earnings this week, Facebook, Inc. (FB) has had to battle the fallout of a data leak scandal. Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump.Given this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover. Only recently, poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) pulled down other tech majors like Apple Inc. (AAPL).But not all the worries the sector faces at the moment could snowball into threats of significant proportions. For instance, most market watchers believe that a divided Congress is unlikely to regulate data gathering of the kind practiced by Facebook or Google. Online advertising spends, therefore, are likely to remain largely unchanged.However, higher user engagement will still be topmost on the list of investor priorities. Ultimately, earnings would not only have to be good overall. They would have to be strong enough to outweigh recent sector concerns.Unlike the Finance sector whose earnings performance notably improved this earnings season compared to other recent periods, the Tech sector's earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters. This strength is expected to continue in the Q1 earnings season as well.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter. (Read:  )That's head and shoulders above the autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 18% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.Tech stocks have been battered on several fronts this year, the latest being poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor. However, several of the concerns surrounding the sector are unlikely to build up into something larger.For instance, U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to impose stringent regulation on tech majors in the near term. Meanwhile, in keeping with stellar fourth-quarter results, first-quarter numbers are likely to be impressive. is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the PowerShares Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PFM), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $28.64 per unit.With PFM trading at a recent price near $25.68 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.50% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PFM's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX), SJW Group (Symbol: SJW), and Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Symbol: CL). Although XLNX has traded at a recent price of $64.90/share, the average analyst target is 14.44% higher at $74.27/share. Similarly, SJW has 12.50% upside from the recent share price of $56.00 if the average analyst target price of $63.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CL to reach a target price of $78.22/share, which is 12.11% above the recent price of $69.77. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of XLNX, SJW, and CL:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"etflix paved the way for another strong performance in the market on Tuesday. Last night after the bell, the streaming giant reported an impressive quarter that included a much larger-than-expected growth in subscribers, so we felt pretty good that this important stock would have a solid session.It didn't disappoint.Shares of NFLX climbed more than 9% today, which, combined with other positive quarterly performances, sent each of the major indices sharply higher. The NASDAQ won the day with a surge of 1.74% to 7281.1. The S&P gained 1.07% to 2706.4 and the Dow was up 0.87% (or another 200+ points) to 24,786.6.Investors have lofty expectations for this quarter. We here at Zacks are expecting total earnings for the S&P to jump more than 16.5% from last year on 7.5% higher revenues. It's very early in the season, but the first reports suggest those estimates are very doable.In addition to Netflix, UnitedHealth also was a bright spot by climbing more than 3.5% after better-than-expected results and a raised earnings forecast.

he rising prominence of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for training artificial intelligence (AI) models has opened up a huge opportunity for  (NASDAQ: XLNX) as it controls  . Energias Market Research estimates that sales of these chips could increase at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 9% through 2023 to almost $13 billion.Xilinx, however, needs to stay on top of its game in the FPGA market as it faces competition from a big fish like  (NASDAQ: INTC) . Chipzilla realized the importance of FPGAs early on, forecasting that a third of cloud service providers will be  in data centers by 2020. As a result, Intel bought Altera for $16.7 billion back in 2015 to make its entry into this space.But Xilinx's  has kept Intel from eating into its market share, and it won't be relinquishing this advantage anytime soon thanks to its latest chip design -- codenamed Everest.Image Source: Getty ImagesXilinx has reportedly invested four years, employed 1,500 engineers, and incurred $1 billion in research and development costs for Project Everest. But what is it. It's a chip design that packs together an FPGA, a CPU, high-bandwidth memory, and fast connectivity to the network. Usually, an FPGA can be reprogrammed to perform a variety of tasks as compared to traditional chips that can only perform the task they were originally designed for.This is why these chips have been gaining traction in artificial intelligence applications as compared to traditional chips such as GPUs and CPUs, which are restricted in their capacity due to their fixed architecture. And, the addition of a CPU makes the FPGA platform even more versatile as it can be used to execute both specific and customizable tasks, speeding up the data center and making it more suitable for AI applications. In fact, Xilinx claims that this integrated chip package is 20 times faster than its existing offerings while running AI applications.Now, Xilinx hasn't created something new by fusing together an FPGA and a CPU. Intel has launched such hybrid chips in the past, and it is reportedly working on a new generation of a hybrid FPGA-CPU device. But then, Xilinx seems to have beaten Chipzilla to the market with its own offering this time, and this could spell trouble for Intel's programmable solutions business.Xilinx's Everest chip is based on the 7-nanometer (nm) architecture, while Intel is currently still making the jump from a 14nm to a 10nm platform. Intel previewed its 10nm chips in September last year, but it hasn't revealed when it will commercially launch them. By comparison, Xilinx is expected to start shipping its Everest-based chips from next year.A lower nanometer number means that the chip platform is based on a smaller node, so it should ideally have lower manufacturing costs and deliver more performance for each watt of power consumed.Intel's Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) business grew 14% in 2017 to $1.9 billion, accounting for 3% of the company's total business. So, FPGAs don't move the needle in a big way for Intel, but this business has got great potential. In fact, if Intel is able to maintain its current market share of 42% in the FPGA space, its revenue from the PSG segment could almost triple in the next five years if sales become as big as Energias Market Research estimates.Xilinx, however, is looking to capture as much as 65% of the FPGA market in the next three years, and it is making great progress on this front. Sales of the company's advanced products, which include chips based on advanced processing nodes such as 20nm and 16nm, increased 30% year over year last quarter.These products now supply 56% of the chipmaker's top line as compared to 47% in the prior-year period. The introduction of more advanced products based on the Everest platform should help Xilinx sustain its impressive momentum.Intel reportedly held 48% of the FPGA market back in 2011, so it's lost 6 percentage points over the ensuing years as Xilinx has moved from 52% to 58%. It won't be surprising if Xilinx continues to consolidate its lead on the back of a superior chip platform in the form of Everest.If it could get 60% of the market, based on Energias' estimates, Xilinx would more than triple its trailing-12-month revenue of $2.48 billion by 2023.

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $72.03/share today.Because the $71.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

"I have to thank  (NASDAQ:  ). In August of last year, I discussed the contrarian opportunity in  (NASDAQ:  ). At the time, QCOM was under heavy pressure, but I maintained that the selloff was excessive. But out of nowhere, Broadcom's takeover bid for Qualcomm drove up sentiment for both Broadcom stock and its target.That being said, I wanted a responsible move higher for QCOM, not a slingshot like we witnessed.Furthermore, the bullish thesis almost exclusively centered on Broadcom's accusatory aggressiveness. Several analysts were pushing the argument. I even stated that the markets were suffering ""  ."" I have several reasons why I don't like gambling largely on a single news item, primarily that you never know what's going to happen next.When the new year rolled around, I still maintained that  on the takeover was risky, despite consensus saying otherwise. If it didn't happen, several, perhaps most investors would be disappointed and would proceed to sell out. The markets would punish QCOM, surely, but they'd also take Broadcom stock to task.Guess what? To loosely paraphrase President Trump, the best dealmaker in the history of deal-making stepped in and quashed the biggest deal in the history of the technology industry. In doing so, both AVGO and QCOM look ugly.I'm not here to rehash old news but rather to remind people what got us into this mess. Furthermore, it's always important to reconsider an investment whose catalyst is a high-variable merger. Again, you just don't know what will happen.We're now in the opposite situation compared to where we were late last year. We no longer have ""sure things."" Instead, we have open-ended questions about the company's trajectory. But could this be a fresh contrarian opportunity for Broadcom stock?Our own Will Healy listed out the potential ""bull case 2.0"" in his write-up a few days ago. While not sealing the QCOM deal hurts, Broadcom now has several options.Healy mentioned that management was  for Qualcomm. That leaves several strong companies on the table, including  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Essentially, investors can now purchase Broadcom stock with a stronger balance sheet and healthier prospects. I don't disagree with Healy's logic. At the same time, investors should consider why the Qualcomm deal cratered.President Trump ran on a populist message to win the White House, and he has largely maintained that position. According to  , Trump pulled the plug because the QCOM deal raised national security concerns. But just as importantly, he wasn't going to let a ""foreign-ish"" company with  take over an American stalwart.With the North Korea crisis, the Trump administration has few good options. The options that do exist the White House will take advantage of vigorously. With China being the critical factor in determining a peaceful outcome in North Korea, Trump has to show he means business.The President imposed severe tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a not-so-subtle dig at China. The quashed QCOM deal falls under the same category. Here's the message: rein in North Korea, don't mess with us, or else face the consequences.We can expect more tough actions, making Broadcom stock an unfavorable investment.If the QCOM deal was nixed due to typical competitive concerns, I'd give Broadcom stock another chance. But when you look at the broader geopolitical context, I'd rather consider less Trump-vulnerable options.Whatever you think about the President, we can all agree he wants things done his way or the highway. That kind of thinking buoyed the American working class and the organizations that hire them. However, when you're dealing with multinational affairs such as technology, things are more nuanced.I don't know President Trump personally, but I don't think nuance is his key strength.What I do know is that we're in unprecedented territory, which sparks substantial volatility. Given that so many analysts thought that Broadcom stock and QCOM were sure bets, I'm hesitant on pulling the trigger. Let the volatility ride out, wait for some stable price action, and then reconsider Broadcom.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Wait for Volatility to Subside Before Buying Broadcom Ltd Stock@2018-03-21@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wait-volatility-subside-buying-broadcom-ltd-stock-2018-03-21

" (NASDAQ:  ) is facing a crossroads. With the merger with  (NASDAQ:  ) blocked and a pending return to the U.S., AVGO is left wondering where to go next. Moreover, as the company plans its next product releases and acquisition targets, investors should decide if the failed merger presents them with a buying opportunity in Broadcom stock.Broadcom had offered $117 billion for the company. In a  about Qualcomm, I described QCOM as falling into a lose-lose situation with the merger. Apparently, the Trump Administration decided the merger would become a loser for the country as well since it blocked the deal. Although the company is in the process of moving its headquarters back to the U.S., the government cited it as a ""foreign"" company as it is still based in Singapore.As our own  , Qualcomm supplies products to the Pentagon. The Far East ties imply links to China, which raises a national security concern. Aside from unknown geopolitical issues, Qualcomm's involvement in 5G could also play into the decision.My colleague  , pointing out CEO Hock Tan's reputation for cutting research and shoring up monopoly positions. Many fear such a move would favor China-based  In the 5G space. This could have forced the U.S. military, which prefers to work with American contractors, to buy Chinese equipment.Rumors that Broadcom will attempt the merger again after the move to the U.S. is complete have also emerged. In many respects, the company has remained American. Broadcom was founded in California. It moved overseas when  (hence the ""AVGO"" stock symbol) took it over in 2016. Also, throughout the time in Singapore, the company maintained operations in California. Still, if the government suspects Broadcom would hand the 5G equipment market to Huawei, I doubt this would occur.The question remains where the canceled deal leaves Broadcom and the tech sector in general. Broadcom confirmed that it still plans to move its headquarters back to the U.S. Singapore usually outranks the U.S. in ""  "" surveys. However, most regard the U.S., especially Silicon Valley, as the center of the tech world. Moreover, a U.S. base of operations makes mergers less exposed to the type of reviews that sunk the Qualcomm deal.Given the willingness to spend $117 billion to buy Qualcomm, most believe Broadcom will pursue other mergers.  such as  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Broadcom also acquired dozens of companies throughout its history before its purchase by Avago. Given past behavior, one should assume that these purchases should continue.Consequently, investors should also decide if Broadcom stock is good for them. AVGO stock increased in value after completion of the takeover by Avago. However, since the middle of last year, the stock has seen little movement. In fact, the stock has fallen about 5% since Broadcom announced the proposed merger on Nov. 6. Perhaps investors felt uncomfortable about AVGO, which has a $106 billion market cap, paying $117 billion to buy another company.Now, the pressure for Broadcom to acquire that level of funding remains off. Also, all the rumored targets come with much smaller price tags. And speaking of price tags, Broadcom stock trades at a reasonable valuation on a non-GAAP basis. The AVGO stock price today stands at about $260-per-share. With non-GAAP earnings of $16.02-per-share, the stock trades at only 16 times earnings. Analysts believe profit growth will stay in the high single-digits. Investors will have more information when AVGO reports quarterly earnings on March 15.Looking at the prospective product lines, merger targets and earnings of Broadcom stock, investors must decide if the failed merger presents an opportunity. To be sure, not having Qualcomm leaves AVGO without the benefits of many chip-related products. However, the failed merger also leaves Broadcom's balance sheet in a stronger position and leaves options open for other purchases in the future. With the low non-GAAP valuation, a failed merger by the company may mean the chance to buy AVGO stock with a stronger balance sheet and possibly a brighter future.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Why Broadcom Ltd Stock Is a Solid Buy Now@2018-03-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-broadcom-ltd-stock-solid-buy-now-2018-03-15
"ack in November I  the rationale behind Broadcom’s () M&A pursuit of Qualcomm (), which, according to prominent market observers who followed this drama, the courting process between the two companies became a  takeover attempt.When Singapore-based Broadcom reports first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday, CEO Hock Tan is going to be pressed for details and any insights about his next move beyond San Diego-based Qualcomm. For the three months that ended January, Wall Street expects Broadcom to report $5.03 per share on revenue of $5.32 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $3.63 per share on $4.15 billion in revenue.The blockbuster $117 billion deal for Qualcomm, which would have been the biggest-ever tie-up in the tech sector, is not going to happen. Tons of speculation has now surfaced about where Tan’s attention may turn. But are they as compelling as the one that got away?On Monday President Donald Trump, by signing an executive order to block the deal, effectively said, “over my dead body.” The Trump administration has been steadfast in taking any and all action available to them to prevent foreign companies from gaining too much of an advantage over their U.S. competitors, particular in key industries.And Trump has no interest in giving China the upper hand in mobile cell phone communications. In January, while citing a presentation prepared by an official of National Security Council, Axios  that “China is the dominant malicious actor in the Information Domain.” In this case, Broadcom’s dominance in the wireless chip industry, where it provides wireless components to Apple’s () iPhones is seen as an issue of national security.There was ""credible evidence"" to suggest that Broadcom ""through exercising control of Qualcomm Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,” Trump said in his presidential order. “The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the purchaser (Broadcom) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited.”In other words, don’t waste your time negotiating a sweetened offer. But analysts, meanwhile, have some ideas about what Broadcom can do with the cash it would have otherwise used for Qualcomm. Amit Daryanani, analyst at RBC Capital, believes Broadcom may make a play for memory chip firms and semiconductor capital equipment companies, including Xilinx () or Marvell (). Regarding the former, Daryanani says it can satisfy Broadcom's need to create a ""stable duopoly.”Micron () - a name I  Monday as a potential target for Broadcom - was mentioned by KeyBanc as a likely option. It remains to be seen if any of these rumors come to pass. What we do know is that Broadcom, though its strong execution, has put itself in an enviable position of having disposable cash to fuel its growth for years to come.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Broadcom (AVGO) Earnings: What's Next For AVGO After Qualcomm?@2018-03-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/broadcom-avgo-earnings-whats-next-avgo-after-qualcomm-2018-03-14

So far, graphics processing units (GPUs) from NVIDIA have  when it comes to powering AI applications like cloud computing or self-driving cars. But FPGAs have started making their mark thanks to their versatility and efficiency. (NASDAQ: AMZN) has already launched a cloud-computing virtual server (known as an 'instance' in cloud-computing parlance) based on FPGA chips that allows the company's cloud customers to address several use cases, such as financial analysis and real-time video processing. For our purposes, though, it's important to note that Amazon's F1 cloud computing instance is powered by Xilinx's UltraScale Plus FPGAs, giving the chipmaker a break in this market already.Amazon is increasing FPGA deployment in the cloud, too. After originally making the Xilinx-enabled F1 instance available in only one region, Amazon last quarter rolled it out to four regions across the globe, including the GovCloud, which supports the U.S. government. The instance could be made even more widely available this year, as Xilinx is aggressively training developers to deploy cloud-based applications using FPGAs.Chinese companies  and  have also decidedto use FPGAs in future cloud computing instances, in place of GPUs. Baidu, China's biggest search engine, is tapping Xilinx's FPGAs to power machine-learning and data-security applications in the cloud. E-commerce giant Alibaba will launch two cloud computing instances based on Xilinx FPGAs to handle machine learning and data analytics, among other workloads.A main reason FPGAs have been gaining so much traction in cloud computing to enable AI applications in place of GPUs is that they can be programmed or reprogrammed to perform specialized tasks. By comparison, a GPU can perform only a specific task; its fixed architecture means that it cannot be used for performing a wide variety of tasks. It's also more power hungry when compared to an FPGA. Additionally, FPGAs don't need an operating system to run, where GPUs do, which means that there is one less thing to worry about -- adding to their reliability.So it is not surprising that FPGAs are predicted to carve out a greater slice of the deep-learning chip market, which is expected to grow at an annual pace of 42.2% through 2025, according to Tractica.The growing use of FPGAs in cloud computing has helped Xilinx deliver nine consecutive quarters of revenue growth. The chipmaker reported 8% year-over-year growth during the latest quarter, driven by a stronger contribution from the advanced products segment, which includes the UltraScale series of FPGAs.The company's advanced products now account for 56% of its total sales as compared to 47% in the prior-year period, with sales increasing 30% year over year in the latest quarter. Looking ahead, their contribution to Xilinx's top line will keep getting better as cloud service providers launch more FPGA-based services.Xilinx's current-quarter outlook calls for $650 million in revenue at the midpoint, an increase of almost 7% from the year-ago period. This means that the chipmaker looks well placed to sustain its steady growth in the near term, though it won't be surprising if it steps on the gas in the future thanks to the growing adoption of FPGA chips.According to one estimate, the global FPGA market could be worth almost $13 billion by 2023, growing at an annual pace of 9%. Xilinx now dominates the FPGA space with a market share of almost 60%, and it believes that it has the potential to increase to 65% over the next three years.That type of market share growth seems possible for Xilinx given its growing traction at big cloud players. But even if the company simply holds on to its current share, Xilinx's annual revenue could spike to almost $8 billion by 2023 based on the estimated growth of the FPGA market. (It generated just under $2.5 billion in revenue over the past year.)So, Xilinx has huge growth potential as its FPGA lead and impressive clients put it in prime position to tap the multibillion-dollar AI chip market.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 has performed on par with the industry last year. Both the stock and the industry have rallied 22% in the mentioned timeframe.With expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.3% and a market cap of $17.1 billion, it looks like a stock that investors need to hold on to if they are looking to reap long-term gains.Let's take a look at some of the factors aiding the company's performance.Xilinx's broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices have been witnessing accelerated adoption as evident from its top line. The company recorded revenues of $631.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The figure was above the mid-point of its guidance range of $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million), as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630 million. | The highlight of the quarter was the record quarterly sales figure. It marked the ninth straight quarter of revenue growth. This stellar performance was primarily driven by robust adoption of the company's 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Notably, Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel  .Amazon  was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017. Since then, the company has won five contracts for FPGA-as-a-Service deployments, which, however, haven't come online yet. The list includes prominent names like Alibaba  among others.However, Xilinx's two biggest markets, India and China, continue to be challenged by slow wireless deployments. This makes us slightly cautious about its Communication business.Xilinx currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $74.73, changing hands for $75.69/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $67.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $87.00. The standard deviation is $6.724.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $74.73/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $74.73 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

" month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have lost about 1.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is XLNX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Xilinx reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings (excluding one-time items and tax expense due to the enactment of recent Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017) of 76 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. The figure surged 46.2% from the year-ago quarter and 16.9% from the previous quarter.Revenues for the quarter came in at $631.2 million, which is above the mid-point of its guidance range of $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million), as well as surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630 million.Management noted that Xilinx's revenues increased for the ninth consecutive quarter, reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company's 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped a whopping 30% year over year and 10% sequentially. We note that the segment's contribution to total revenues was 56%, a significant increase from 47% in the year-ago quarter and 52% reported in the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was mainly driven by solid demand for its Zynq SoC platform and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 40% year-over-year growth, backed by robust demand in all of the company's end markets, i.e. automotive, industrial, wireless and consumer.The 20-nm sales soared 70% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets. However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter, registering over four-fold jump in revenues. The company shipped 43 unique products to more than 1,160 discrete customers across all end markets.Revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-earlier quarter and 7% sequentially.On basis of the End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (35% of total revenues) dipped 12% year over year and 2% sequentially. The industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (47% of total revenues) climbed 23% on a year-over-year basis and 7% on a sequential basis. The broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenues) ascended 24% year over year, but declined 3% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific were up 12%, 11%, 10% and 3%, respectively. Nevertheless, sequentially, Japan was weak, declining 8%. This was fully offset by robust growth from North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, which advanced 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel. The company's Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered sturdy top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx noted that it started shipping of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product in the fiscal second quarter, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product facilitates reduction of power consumption (50-75%), as well as footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of its Ultrascale+ FPGAs data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service. Amazon was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017.Since then, the company has got five contracts for FPGA-as-a-Service deployments, which, however, haven't come online yet. The list, which includes the likes of Alibaba, is in the process to deploy two generations of FPGA-as-a-Service by using Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGA chips.Gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) year over year to 71.1% and 90 bps sequentially, and came in above the company's guided range of 69-71%.Operating expenses flared up 6.1% year over year and 3.9% sequentially to $259.3 million. Nonetheless, the figure came in lower than the company's guidance of $260 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.1%, reflecting contraction of 60 bps on a year-over-year basis, but expansion of 80 bps sequentially.Reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, along with healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulted in year-over-year expansion of 230 bps in operating margin, which came in at 30.1%. On a sequential basis, operating margin improved 20 bps, mainly driven by higher gross margin. Additionally, the company noted that it has achieved its goal of attaining 30% in operating margin one quarter ahead.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $189.7 million, up 16.4% year over year and 2.4% sequentially.The company's net income came in at $11.9 million, significantly lower than $141.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter, and $167.5 million posted in the fiscal second quarter. The decline was mainly due to a one-time tax expense of approximately $183 million resulting from ""the recent enactment of Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017"".Excluding this and other one-time items, non-GAAP net income summed $200.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 40% and 19.8% sequentially.Xilinx exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.54 billion compared with $3.56 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.73 billion, down from $1.74 billion at the end of the prior quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $184.7 million from operations and incurred $6.8 million as capital expenditure during the third quarter. The company paid $89.5 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $73.3 million.In the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $577.7 million from operations and incurred $28.9 million as capital expenditure. It paid $263.8 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for $310.8 million.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $635-$665 million (mid-point $650 million). Management projects growth in the Advanced Products segment. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive, Communications and the data-center end market to improve year over year. On the other hand, the Industrial and Aerospace & Defense end markets are estimated to remain flat.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to decrease to $255 million. During the quarter, Xilinx expects to incur a one-time expense of approximately $30 million due to CEO transition. Tax rate is projected between 0% and 5%.The company remains focused on achieving its fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. | At this time, XLNX has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our style scores.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock but the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Monday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.4), with the stock changing hands as low as $68.46 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XLNX makes up 3.44% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading lower by about 2.2% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xilinx (XLNX) Shares Cross 2% Yield Mark@2018-02-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-xlnx-shares-cross-2-yield-mark-2018-02-05

Xilinx, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.35 on 2/22/18, Golar LNG Partners LP will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.5775 on 2/14/18, and Alliance Resource Partners LP will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.51 on 2/14/18. As a percentage of XLNX's recent stock price of $71.75, this dividend works out to approximately 0.49%, so look for shares of Xilinx, Inc. to trade 0.49% lower - all else being equal - when XLNX shares open for trading on 2/6/18. Similarly, investors should look for GMLP to open 2.62% lower in price and for ARLP to open 2.45% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for XLNX, GMLP, and ARLP, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.95% for Xilinx, Inc., 10.50% for Golar LNG Partners LP, and 9.81% for Alliance Resource Partners LP.In Friday trading, Xilinx, Inc. shares are currently off about 1%, Golar LNG Partners LP shares are down about 0.7%, and Alliance Resource Partners LP shares are down about 0.5% on the day.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Ex-Dividend Reminder: Xilinx, Golar LNG Partners and Alliance Resource Partners@2018-02-02@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-dividend-reminder-xilinx-golar-lng-partners-and-alliance-resource-partners-2018-02-02

In the trailing four quarters, excluding quarter under review, the company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of nearly 53%.

However, gains for the Dow were pared after Trump's comments on the strength of the dollar weighed on the blue-chip index.In an interview to CNBC from World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Trump stated that the dollar will keep getting stronger under his administration and that U.S. Treasury of Secretary Steve Mnuchin's remarks regarding dollar was ""misinterpreted."" ""The dollar is going to get stronger and stronger, and ultimately I want to see a strong dollar,"" he further stated.The S&P 500 gained a meager 1.7 points to end in the positive territory. Gains for the broad-market index were rather broad based, buoyed by expectations of strong corporate earnings.

The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) gained 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively.On the other hand, the Nasdaq lost almost 4 points to end the session in the negative territory. Losses for the tech laden index were due to a slump in technology stocks after Apple  and Xilinx plunged 1.8% and 5.1%, respectively.

At the close, Xilinx was down 5.1% to 60.74 on the  .Upside in the quarter was driven by about $12 million in Bitcoin-related sales of field-programmable gate arrays, ""without which the company might have missed"" estimates, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report. Its FPGA chips are being used for cryptocurrency mining in Bitcoin rigs, Rolland said.Xilinx likely booked over $8 million in Bitcoin-related FPGA sales in the first few weeks of 2018 as well, he said. However, Rolland believes the Bitcoin boost for Xilinx will be temporary.""We still contend that crypto-related currency is less durable than their other end-markets ... and that this revenue can disappear fully over two quarters,"" he said. Rolland rates Xilinx stock as neutral, but raised his price target to 70 from 65.San Jose, Calif.-based Xilinx received 47% of its revenue from industrial, aerospace and defense applications in the December quarter, 35% from communications and data center, and 18% from broadcast, consumer and automotive.

 ()Semiconductor giant Intel () is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. With the shares now trading near 52-week highs, it would seem investors have been satisfied with the company’s response to the security vulnerability with its CPU chips.Intel stock has risen steadily in past five days, while netting about 12% in three months, besting both the Dow and S&P 500 index during that span. But for the stock to maintain its upward trajectory, management must assuage investors that any chip flaw is a thing of the past and the company’s recent moves, including its investments in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technology, has Intel on the right path towards long-term growth.For the quarter that ended December, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn 86 cents per share and revenues of $16.34 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning came to 79 cent per share on $16.37 billion in revenue. For the full year, EPS is expected to rise 10% year over year to $3.25 per share, while full-year revenue of $62.05 billion would rise 4.3% year over year.Over the past three months, the EPS estimate has risen by 3 cents, suggesting Wall Street is confident about what Intel will say Thursday. And it’s for good reason, given that the company has posted eight straight earnings beats. In the third quarter, Intel reported adjusted EPS of $1.01 per share, which easily beat analysts’ forecast by a whopping 21 cents. Likewise, third quarter revenue of $16.15 billion also topped forecasts by $420 million.As have been the case for some time, the company continues to capitalize in its Data Center Group (DCG) segment, which contains server/networking, where it competes with heavyweight Nvidia () and Xilinx (). DCG posted Q3 revenue of $4.9 billion, rising 7% year over year, topping Intel’s own forecast. Meanwhile, the company showed continued strength in its Internet-of-Things segment, where revenue surged 23% to $849 million.On Thursday, investors will watch closely to see if these growth trends continue. CEO Brian Krzanich, during the company’s presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, talked about the future of Intel, particular what he called “immersive media.” Krzanich boasted about new content and delivery systems he says Intel is investing in that will help power not only connected devices, but also VR/AR.Analysts on Thursday are certain to press for details about where and how Krzanich believes Intel can win in these markets. Elsewhere, there’s the balance sheet, which has become a key focus area for investors. The company ended Q3 with a net debt position of more than $14 billion. To what extent can the new corporate tax rate help alleviate some of that debt burden and how will it impact Intel’s buyback plan and R&D?All of that said, Intel remains in a strong position to power through 2018 with four earnings and revenue beats, given that expectations are so low. Fiscal 2018 calls for only a 2-cent EPS growth above 2017, while revenue is seen growing at less-than 3%. In other words, impressive EPS and revenue guidance, which I expect Intel to give, can propel the stock higher from here. And with a decent yield of 2.4%, patience can still be a virtue with Intel.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Intel (INTC) 4th Quarter Earnings: What to Expect@2018-01-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-4th-quarter-earnings-what-expect-2018-01-25

"hares of  rallied during yesterdays' after-hour trade, after the chipmaker announced overwhelming third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein its earnings and revenues, both, came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company beat its guidance at every point.Xilinx reported fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings (excluding one-time items and tax expense due to the enactment of recent Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017) of 76 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. The figure surged 46.2% from the year-ago quarter and 16.9% from the previous quarter.Revenues for the quarter came in at $631.2 million, which is above the mid-point of its guidance range of $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million), as well as surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $630 million.Investors' optimism about the stock has been mainly boosted by some huge accomplishment achieved by Xilinx. The highlight of the quarter was attaining record quarterly sales figure, the ninth straight quarter of revenue growth and reaching 30% of operating margin target well ahead of time. | Management noted that Xilinx's revenues increased for the ninth consecutive quarter, reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company's 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped a whopping 30% year over year and 10% sequentially. We note that the segment's contribution to total revenues was 56%, a significant increase from 47% in the year-ago quarter and 52% reported in the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was mainly driven by solid demand for its Zynq SoC platform and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 40% year-over-year growth, backed by robust demand in all of the company's end markets, i.e. automotive, industrial, wireless and consumer.The 20-nm sales soared 70% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets. However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter, registering over four-fold jump in revenues. The company shipped 43 unique products to more than 1,160 discrete customers across all end markets.Revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-earlier quarter and 7% sequentially.On basis of the End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (35% of total revenues) dipped 12% year over year and 2% sequentially. The industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (47% of total revenues) climbed 23% on a year-over-year basis and 7% on a sequential basis. The broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenues) ascended 24% year over year, but declined 3% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from North America, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific were up 12%, 11%, 10% and 3%, respectively. Nevertheless, sequentially, Japan was weak, declining 8%. This was fully offset by robust growth from North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, which advanced 3%, 3% and 2%, respectively.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer has been helping the company gain market share. Its expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel  . The company's Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered sturdy top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx noted that it started shipping of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product in the fiscal second quarter, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product facilitates reduction of power consumption (50-75%), as well as footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of its Ultrascale+ FPGAs data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service. Amazon  was the first to use Xilinx chips and started offering FPGA-as-a-Service in May 2017.Since then, the company has got five contracts for FPGA-as-a-Service deployments, which, however, haven't come online yet. The list, which includes the likes of Alibaba  , is in the process to deploy two generations of FPGA-as-a-Service by using Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGA chips.Gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) year over year to 71.1% and 90 bps sequentially, and came in above the company's guided range of 69-71%.Operating expenses flared up 6.1% year over year and 3.9% sequentially to $259.3 million. Nonetheless, the figure came in lower than the company's guidance of $260 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.1%, reflecting contraction of 60 bps on a year-over-year basis, but expansion of 80 bps sequentially.Reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, along with healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulted in year-over-year expansion of 230 bps in operating margin, which came in at 30.1%. On a sequential basis, operating margin improved 20 bps, mainly driven by higher gross margin. Additionally, the company noted that it has achieved its goal of attaining 30% in operating margin one quarter ahead.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $189.7 million, up 16.4% year over year and 2.4% sequentially.The company's net income came in at $11.9 million, significantly lower than $141.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter, and $167.5 million posted in the fiscal second quarter. The decline was mainly due to a one-time tax expense of approximately $183 million resulting from ""the recent enactment of Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017"".Excluding this and other one-time items, non-GAAP net income summed $200.6 million, marking year-over-year growth of 40% and 19.8% sequentially.Xilinx exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.54 billion compared with $3.56 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.73 billion, down from $1.74 billion at the end of the prior quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $184.7 million from operations and incurred $6.8 million as capital expenditure during the third quarter. The company paid $89.5 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $73.3 million.In the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $577.7 million from operations and incurred $28.9 million as capital expenditure. It paid $263.8 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for $310.8 million.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $635-$665 million (mid-point $650 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance range is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $642.2 million.Management projects growth in the Advanced Products segment. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive, Communications and the data-center end market to improve year over year. On the other hand, the Industrial and Aerospace & Defense end markets are estimated to remain flat.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to decrease to $255 million. During the quarter, Xilinx expects to incur a one-time expense of approximately $30 million due to CEO transition. Tax rate is projected between 0% and 5%.The company remains focused on achieving its fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion.Xilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of FPGA replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company's revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors, such as wired communication, data center and industrial, will stoke revenue growth.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior.Most of the emerging economies are witnessing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in the Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will lead to heightened demand for Xilinx's 16-nm, 20-nm and 28-nm nodes, thereby positively influencing its overall financial performance for the next few quarters.Nonetheless, the company's two biggest markets, India and China, are still facing the challenge of slow wireless deployments, which makes us slightly cautious about its Communication business.Currently, Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  .It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Gross margin was 71.1%, higher than our guidance, as our product mix was more favorable than expected. Operating expense was $259 million, in line with our forecast. We continue to execute to the plan we outlined at our Analyst's Day last May. Operating income for the quarter increased 2.4% sequentially to $189.7 million. Our operating margin hit 30.1%, one quarter ahead of schedule.As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, we incurred a tax expense of $183.2 million, or a rate of 94% in the December quarter. This one-time tax impact was related to the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities, somewhat offset by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate. Our net income for Q3 was $11.9 million or $0.05 per share. For comparison purposes, if our tax rate had been in the middle of our forecasted range, our EPS would have been $0.67 per share.Now on to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $1.9 billion net cash after our debt. Operating cash flow was $185 million. We returned $162 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form of $89 million in dividends and the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares for $73 million, an average price of $71.34 per share. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we have returned nearly 100% of our operating cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we have said in the past, we continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and will continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are still executing on our share repurchase program and have $372 million remaining on that authorization. We expect ending share count in the March quarter to be in the range of 255 million to 260 million diluted shares.For guidance, in the March quarter we are expecting sales to be between $635 million and $665 million. Our backlog is up strongly as we begin the quarter and we continue to expect growth in our Advanced Products. With regards to end market, we expect Communications and Data Center to be up. Industrial and A&D will be approximately flat. Broadcast, Consumer, and Automotive is also expected to grow. While Auto and Broadcast are growing, a significant amount of growth in this set of end markets will be from Consumer, which bears some explanation. We have treated cryptocurrency as it has emerged as a consumer business. This business has become larger and more durable, driving growth in fiscal Q4, though it is still potentially volatile. Victor will also talk more about this.Our gross margin for the quarter will be approximately 69% to 71%. We expect core operating expense to decrease to approximately $255 million. However, in this quarter we will recognize one-time expenses of approximately $30 million related primarily to our Chief Executive Officer transition. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 0% and 5% for this quarter, as impacted by the tax reform act. Our financial performance year to date and our guidance for the fourth quarter indicate to us that we are on track to meet or exceed our annual guidance on all operating parameters. Let me now turn the call over to Victor. -- Thank you, Lorenzo. And my sincere thanks to you, Moshe. I'm going to stay on script because while this is your 41st call, this is my first. And I probably shouldn't blow that. So good afternoon, everyone. I'm truly honored and extremely excited to be speaking with you on my first Xilinx quarterly . And I'm particularly fortunate to be assuming leadership, not only with Moshe taking this company to such a great position, but in truly a very dynamic time in our industry. By focusing on delivering unique value in emerging areas as well as our traditional markets, we will build on this revenue growth we've established and create the next wave of shareholder value.In an era where the pace of Moore's Law has slowed, Xilinx is in a unique and unprecedented position of strength. Enormous amounts of data being created, stored, and processed presents tremendous opportunities for Xilinx. Applications like machine learning, compute and storage acceleration, autonomous driving, and 5G all promise to make an enormous impact on people's lives. Tomorrow's compute intensive applications require optimized platforms that are capable of delivering both acceleration and adaptability. Xilinx possesses the right technologies and capabilities to take a leadership position. And I'm delighted to have this opportunity to help the company maximize its potential.Now I'd like to add my comments about both the December quarter and the outlook for the March quarter. I'm very pleased with our consistent execution as demonstrated in our December quarter's results. Revenue grew, as Moshe said, for the ninth consecutive quarter to the record $631 million. Additionally, our operating margin exceeded 30% one quarter ahead of our plan, driven by better than expected gross margin. Our overall revenue growth was again driven by our Advanced Products. Revenue from these products increased 10% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. This category now represents 56% of our overall revenue, significantly up from 52% last quarter and 47% a year ago.Both our industry leading 20-nm and 60-nm technology nodes set significant sales records. With our 60-nm portfolio, we are now delivering 43 unique products to approximately 1,160 customers. Revenues from our Zynq SoC platform, an integral element of our multi-market expansion efforts, increased nearly 40% from a year ago quarter and is expected to grow again in the March quarter. This platform has established sales traction in all of our end markets with significant success in the automotive, industrial, wireless, and consumer markets. As Lorenzo noted, our product is finding some success in cryptocurrency mining system. We're finding that our products and customer support capabilities really fit the need of this emerging market and we do anticipate future growth while being cautious about the volatility of this segment.With regards to end markets, the Industrial, Aerospace and Defense markets set another quarterly record with sales of $297 million, an increase of 7% sequentially and 23% from the year ago quarter. This growth was driven by both the Semiconductor Test and Emulation Applications. Our unrivaled technology leadership has been a very significant driver for this record setting revenue performance. Our strong momentum in the Data Center continues unabated. Market lead Alibaba recently announced plans for two generations of FPGA as a service, F2 and F3 using Xilinx's Ultrascale + FPGAs. And beyond the public cloud, we're seeing strong activity in workload, specific compute acceleration, storage, and smart nets. These Data Center opportunities continue to be one of our key medium-to-long-term market expansion opportunities.As we look forward to the March quarter, our guidance of $635 million to $665 million is again expected to be driven by the continued growth of our Advanced Products portfolio. If we achieve this guidance, we will establish another sales record by Xilinx. Our overall revenue performance through the three quarters of the year and our Q4 guidance gives us confidence that we will exceed our $2.5 billion plan for Fiscal 2018. And as we mentioned, we already reached our goal of 30% plus operating margin a quarter early.Now I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.The floor is now open for questions. If you do have a question, please press ""*"" and ""1"" on your telephone keypad. Once again, that is ""*"" followed by ""1"" on your telephone keypad. Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.Your first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. -- Hi, thank you very much and I'm going to ad-lib here. Moshe, thanks for being a gentleman all these years. We have not always seen eye to eye but you always treated us very fairly. So good luck on the next innings.Question on the op margin and also kudos for hitting that target. And my question is for you, Victor. How should we think about sustainability of that? Given the increase in the next node, and that's been the case forever, but it seems like a step jump in that. And also you're spending more on the FPGA as a service model. So just help us understand how should investors have confidence that this has been a bogey that has been elusive on a consistent basis for Xilinx so how should we think about that? Thank you. -- Yeah. So from a growth margin perspective, that has a lot of factors but a big factor is NIC. So in terms of the way the segments came out and we had really strong growth in segments for which we generally have very good value. Of course, it's more complicated than that. There's a lot of things we're doing for controlling the cogs and so forth. So I would say that we absolutely can -- excuse me, I was referring to gross margin rather than in terms of the operating margin. Obviously that falls through but -- so at that level, in terms of the operating margin, I think we've been very careful about investing where we see bigger returns and also being mindful of where we are on the gross margin line. So I think that we're going to be balancing those things. Right? We generally give a range of the upper 60s up into the 70s and I think if we look at how return we would get by investing further, we'll do that aggressively. And other places, we absolutely want to give return to the shareholders. So. -- So, Ambrish, you know, I think maybe I'm going to pre-empt some other questions on this. But we're -- I guess outside of tax, which I'll help you guys out a little bit on for the future, we're going to stick with our traditional cadence of providing specific financial guidance initially in our Q4 earnings call and then more in detail at our Analyst's Day. So. But I think kind of the fundamental principles that Victor laid out will be what we apply. Right? Which is we're investing in the company and we're continuing to manage it to return the most we can to the shareholders. -- And I think the piece that you have given us is the scale. And I think that's what I was hoping to hear from you is that you're about to reach your inflection point on the FPGA as a service model, which will help fund that. -- Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mention -- I didn't address that piece of the question. Look, I think we've been pretty consistent in saying FPGA as a service is a more mid-term to longer-term opportunity. From a running perspective, that is not yet in a very material state. I'd also point out that FPGA as a service is only one segment of the computing acceleration, which is only one segment of our opportunity in the Data Center. I think we've been pretty consistent in saying that we have many opportunities, not only on the compute side but also in storage and in networking side. So I think that's a little less connected to your question regarding sustainability of the operating margin. I think on the operating margin side, again, you're seeing that we have achieved our goal ahead of plan and we do think there's legs here. On the other hand, if we feel like the right thing to do is invest to ensure strong growth, we'll do that. But we'll always be mindful of returning good value to the shareholders. -- Okay. Thank you. Good luck.Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. And Moshe, best wishes on your next venture here. I was wondering if you could just talk about the consumer bucket. Obviously this cryptocurrency has been a big driver for a lot. Maybe just talk about December and then outlook into March, if you can kind of frame how big that's getting and how much of a driver is it for that segment into March? -- Blayne, I'm glad you asked that because we're flagging it because in the past this has been really not material enough to even mention. Because of the fact that it's grown -- and we're talking about like in the tens, low tens of millions, we wanted to flag this. However, this is not like a GPU sized kind of exposure. Right. And again, you heard both Lorenzo and I say that there's a lot of volatility here. So I wouldn't -- we're mentioning it because now it's not something that's totally negligible. But just to give you the right order of magnitude, it is not something where we suggest you try a new model. It's very volatile and it's a very new and emerging thing. -- Okay. Thanks.Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. -- Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first off, sorry, Moshe, congrats. Pleasure working with you. And Victor, look forward to working with you and congrats to you as well.I guess for my question, maybe kind of a follow-up to the first one, as you think about tax reform and access to all that cash, how does that change your thinking, if at all, in terms of R&D investments as you project ahead into beyond Fiscal '18? -- I don't think there's a first order impact from tax reform on our operating model. It comes mostly into play for us in terms of capital allocation. So I think regardless of tax reform, and regardless of the quarter-to-quarter specifics, we will maintain very high profitability and very high cash flow generation. So what we see as the primary benefit of tax reform is freer use of cash on a global basis. We're right now understanding some of the longer term impacts of it because there are some second order or more detailed aspects of tax reform that will impact cash payments. So we're modeling that as best we can out into the future and we'll use that to influence what we do on capital allocation. That's still in the works and, again, we'll probably talk more in detail about that at our Analyst's Day. -- I mean, do you have a sense of your GAAP and/or cash tax rates? Or that's something for the Analyst's Day? -- Sure, sure. Like I said earlier, I think it's unfair to you guys to say, ""Okay, one quarter they had 93%, the next quarter it's going to be 0% to 5%."" And not leave you with any guidance past that. We actually -- and I'll wrap all the considered caveats around this. But as we understand it right now, our forward tax rate should be between 10% and 15%. So pretty much like we had experienced in the recent past. So that's our best guidance right now. But it's obviously not without some caution. There's potential for regulatory changes as more technical guidance comes out on different aspects of that. But right now, that's the best we can get. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations. Thanks for letting me ask a question. And Moshe, I'll echo the sentiment. Thanks for all the help, helping to understand Xilinx through the years. Greatly appreciated.I guess my question is sort of a follow-up on the margin side and I want to focus really on the gross margin side. This is only the second time in corporate history that I can see in our model that you've had gross margins above 71%. And Victor, I understand the importance of mix. So I guess Part 1 of the question is can you help me understand what happened in the quarter from a mix perspective to make things this rich. And I guess more importantly, just given that you're broadening your lead against the competition and broadening the number of applications that you can address, why shouldn't we think that there's a continued structural upward bias on gross margins over time? The caveat being no one should have to apologize for 71% gross margin. -- Thanks for that. -- Yeah, thanks for that. Yeah. You know, as I said, I talked about mix and that was really an oversimplification. Look, on the one hand, we are creating a lot of value. Right? I mean, our products, our leadership, not only because we've executed well and delivered what we said, but we've done innovations. The most recent one, for instance, the RFSoC, where we integrated RF class data convertors monolithically with a 60-nm digital process. That's saving the customer power, costs, size, weight, all these things. In some of the other areas, we have the largest capacity by factors. So part of this is you've got to be creating value. Right? And then if you do that and, on top of it, you execute and you get and so forth, then you're going to get value. There's also just, of course, the natural fact, the mix pieces add -- the different segments have natural different levels of margin, right?So put cryptocurrency aside. We all know, of course, Consumer, to the extent that we play, there's more price challenge, there's more margin leanness. The other places that we play, in Aerospace and Defense, for instance, and so forth, and in general, if you are delivering value, you can get the value. So on the one hand I would agree with you, is that I think with our innovations and what we're doing, that we are getting value and we're giving value to the customers. But the variability does become where you have certain markets, if they pick up very strongly and they're naturally in that market. I have more ASP competitors, then that's going to change things. But we certainly think that, with leadership and the products and the continued innovation, that, in general, we can and will get good, solid gross margins. But you'll always have that variability and then, of course, you know -- -- No, the gross margins are -- just to remind you all. John, I know we've had this conversation before. It's not reflective only of a one quarter shift in mix. There's a decade now long legacy of focus on improving the gross margin of the company. And our approach does provide us with a solid basis for, just as Victor said, consistently strong expectations on gross margin. But we're in very competitive markets in a lot of places and in markets where, by the nature of those markets, you're under consistent cost pressure. So, yes, while we have a firm basis, saying we're going to keep growing it is probably a little aggressive. -- Lorenzo, what specifically this quarter about mix was such a tailwind? -- So we had actually the benefit from -- Victor and Moshe both mentioned our Advanced Products growth, particularly our newer products, which happen to be the highest value products we can provide. Those provided an uplift. And we also had good business in general in the Industrial and Aerospace and Defense, Test Measurement, and Emulation end markets, which generally provide an uplift for our margin structure. -- Thanks a lot. Very helpful.Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. -- Thanks very much. Reading off my carefully crafted question script, can you fill us in what percent of overall revenues came from Automotive and how much Automotive was up year-over-year? -- So Auto was up year-over-year on the order of a little more than 20% but I think that's a little bit of a measurement anomaly. We had somewhat of a low point last year this quarter in Auto. And we are seeing it still in around the 7%-ish of overall sales. Most of that business, again, is ADAS related and most of the growth is ADAS and Zynq for us going forward. -- Great. Thanks so much.Your next question comes from the line of John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital Markets. -- Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good luck to you, Moshe, and, Victor, congrats on your new role. My question is around Comms. Last night, you heard TI kind of call it out as a source of area of weakness that they're seeing. It looks like Comms for you came in maybe slightly below what you were expecting but you did guide for Comms to be up in March. I'm just wondering if you could give us some color in terms of what sort of demand trends you're seeing there. And also if you could comment on what you're seeing between Wireless and Wireline, that would be great. -- Sure. So Wireless is actually up some. I think we mentioned several times that we're in virtually all of the pre-5G prototyping, so we saw some growth there. We also saw some strength in 4G deployments in India. Wired slowed down some, mainly due to some deployment of some products. But when we look at the current quarter, we see that Wired will be back up and Wireless will probably be about flat-ish. -- Got it. Thank you. -- And not inconsistent with what we've been saying. Wireless will bounce around, around this level, until we see the 5G inflection point. -- Great. Thanks. And I had a follow-up question on M&A. It seemed like M&A activity is starting to pick up. And similarly with the tax reform and the ability to repatriate cash, it seems like activity in the sector could pick up. One, does that give you an opportunity to be a little bit more proactive on the M&A front? And can you also remind us in terms of how much offshore cash you will have the opportunity to repatriate? -- So let me take the more specific, the cash question first. And then I think Victor can elaborate on the market situation for M&A. The easiest way to think about it right now is, after we pay the transition tax, which for the most part is a book number because the structure is deferred over eight years, pretty much our cash balance is free to move about the world. So that's part of this assessment that we're doing overall. So gross cash at $3.6 billion, net cash of $1.9 billion. We don't force the limitations on applying that cash anywhere in the world or seeing any sort of tax penalty for doing it. We will have ongoing tax, which on a cash basis will be higher than we've experienced in the past. But there won't be restrictions on cash utilization. Or maybe better put, economic disincentive to use it anywhere. So that's a good news part of tax reform for us. -- So on the M&A side, I view it as our focus is, ""What is our strategic objectives and goals?"" And M&A could be a tool to sort of further that. So we look at it that way and we always consider that along with other many options. You know, ultimately, of course, you want to maximize shareholder value. That's the, from a financial perspective, the main goal. But I would say that the focus is to think about what all our options are in the strategic context and what we're trying to accomplish. And if M&A's the thing, then that would be considered along with other options. Clearly on this call, this isn't the time to talk about that kind of vision of things. There will be a time later in the quarter where we'll have the opportunity to talk a little bit more about direction and vision.Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. -- Hi, guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I also want to echo the congratulations to Moshe and Victor. Just wanted to follow up on the end market splits. You guys have done a great job growing for, I think it's nine consecutive quarters on a sequential basis. And the annual guidance ranges you've given have been very helpful and it sounds like you're going to beat those for this fiscal year. But there's some pretty big deltas between what you guided by segment and what you've delivered, with the Comms and Data Center side being well below your guidance but the Industrial and Aerospace and Defense being well above. So I guess with all that being said, what was surprising in those two segments versus what you originally thought? And what's the duration of the new trajectory? Do you think it stays this weak on one side and this strong on the other or is something going to mean revert? -- So versus where we thought, I think you've gotten the primary points, which are the Industrial and A&D set of end markets, which includes Industrial, true Industrial, Aerospace and Defense, and Test Measurement and Emulation, were a very pleasant surprise with their strength this year. And that's pretty much across the board in those end markets. The Consumer, Automotive, and Broadcast set of end markets is on track, with maybe Automotive not as strong as we initially thought but, as I said earlier, still growing in ADAS applications and still a good platform for us in the future.Wireless and Wired Communications, Data Center end market that has underperformed, partially because Wired is not -- Wired and Data Center is not as strong collectively as we thought. And then Wireless was bouncy and tough to predict to begin with. But as we go forward, I think the -- without being very specific about the direction, like I said, we'll provide more of that later on this year, the characteristics that are driving Industrial and A&D seem to be sustainable. The Consumer, Automotive, and Broadcast business, as we talked about, we could see some good upside from the -- as we talk about it now, from applications like the cryptocurrency and we look to maintain our position in automotive. Wireless we still think is going to have that same basic characteristic of flat-ish with ups and downs until we see the 5G. And Wired and Data Center, I think we're going to continue to see slow growth. -- But it will be up. I'm not going to repeat all that. I do want to add a little just in term of applications. A&D has been strong. That is not a surprise frankly. I think that is something that's been strong and we definitely see that continuing. In Test Measure and Emulation, I think we can expect to be strong, maybe it was a little stronger than we expected, but I wouldn't say it's a surprise. I think some of the other comments that Lorenzo shared, I would agree. But, I mean, overall, I don't want you to think that some of these things we didn't anticipate. It just happens that a lot of the growth fell in that single bucket. Right? If you break it down more, as Lorenzo said, there's good growth in multiple sub-segments.I would also say, in general, we're talking about by segments, we talked also about the fact, and I mentioned in my remarks, that Zynq is also a very strong platform. And I see that strengthening across multiple markets. So I think there are definitely areas where we've been seeing it and we see that sustained. So. -- That's helpful color. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird. -- Thank you. I'll join my peers and congratulate both Moshe on many years of significant achievements and also Victor on your new role. Regarding 5G, is it fair to assume that this ramp is going to be more small cell-based versus bay station based? And so as such, should we view 5G as potentially being more of a higher unit but lower silicon content opportunity? And perhaps if you could refresh us a little bit on when you think the ramp beyond field tests can be more meaningful over time? -- Yeah, let me go and answer that last part first. So I think we've been pretty consistent in saying we really see the ramp more in the 2020 time frame. I mean, yes, there are some early things going on now and we've got approximately 90% of those early pre-5G and proof of concepts. And I also refer to a really disruptive product in the RFSoC, but of course that's just getting out now. Now to transition to the first part of your answer. Let me start with RFSoC in that regard. I mean, RFSoC is something that is something that is not just 5G. It's the right technology and really the way to deal with any massive MIMO kind of architecture. So that's a very large TiN arrays and that's the trend that's being moved to across -- in general, not only in wireless infrastructure but other, very adjacent applications. Right? And then in terms of small cell, yes, there's small cell but I think that it's really a range of different types of infrastructure. So I wouldn't say that it's just small cell. So in general, I would say we see a very strong position there but, again, the ramp is more in the 2020 timeframe. And as far as RFSoC, we're seeing great momentum but it's really not meaningful revenue at this point. Right? People are just starting to design with that. That goes into production this calendar year. -- Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up. So it looks like the tens of millions of revenue target that you had for this fiscal year for FaaS potentially gets pushed out a little bit. How should we look at the ramp? Is there a timing at which we see more of an inflection point and any qualification that you may want to put forward for the next year or two for Data Center and this customer? -- I'm sorry. When you're referring to the tens of millions being pushed out, could you? -- I think that was somewhat of a soft target that Xilinx had put in place regarding this fiscal year in terms of Data Center ramp. -- Okay. I see. Yeah. I mean, again, what I would say is that the -- first of all, Data Center. The traditional portion of our Data Center revenue, the kinds of deployments we did in the past, largely in storage but not only in storage, that still is actually the larger part of the revenue over all. I think the revenue that is the emerging part that we referred to, and I think what you were probably really targeting your earlier discussion about FaaS and so forth, I mean, that is in the smaller number that you're talking about. Now it's still in those tens of millions. I don't see this as a push-out. I think we've been pretty much consistent in saying that this is a period where we're building application, we're getting the tools and the infrastructure out there, we're building an ecosystem, and so forth.Just to put this in perspective, in the Reinvent conference that Amazon had back in 2016, November of 2016, that's when they announced, and they were the first ones to announce, FPGA as a service. They actually announced it but it didn't even start going online until April of 2017. Since that time, we now have five announced FaaS deployments. But again, many of them are just coming on line. In the Reinvent conference Amazon just had this past November, they announced the fact that they have now, instead of just one region, there are three regions which FPGA accelerators are deployed, including the secured U.S. government cloud, and for, I think a total of 11 availability regions.So I think what I'm trying to suggest here is that it is not at the stage where we're talking about big revenue growth. This is all about building the applications, the infrastructure, getting the deployments. And we're seeing very good momentum on that perspective. I don't see that there's a push-out per se, I think that it's just, again, building the foundation and getting the applications out and getting these engagements going. -- Great. That's very useful. Yeah, very useful. Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. -- Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the good results and outlook. And again my congrats to Moshe as well. If you can help us understand the commentary on crypto, it would be helpful. Specifically you're saying you think it's more durable or maybe that translates to sustainable. Is there something about your position in that market or demand trends that you think reflect something that indicates that sustainability in that marketplace? Thank you. -- Yeah, well, I think obviously the cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and so I think, one, in some situations, what happens is that things change so much that it's hard in that sense to predict. In terms of the sustainability though, we do see, as we said, we do see that we've had revenue in the low tens of millions. We see that kind of level of revenue continuing. And we also are providing support for these customers. Okay? It's no secret that there's so much involved here that people are doing custom ASICs for this and they're also using GPUs. Now, the reason why we do see some fip here is because it's a very dynamic situation, too, with -- Bitcoin gets a lot of press, but really there's multiple different currencies and there's a lot of things happening. So with that kind of change, the flexibility we have that has that value. Right? But we're very cautious here because of the volatility of it and we don't want you to do over-read in what we're saying. That's why in the TP space, they've had much bigger exposure but nonetheless it's gotten to the point where we don't want to just have it not at least raised -- Yeah. No, I think the durability point comes from when it first -- when we first saw it, it was a very small business. And it grew significantly but we didn't have any line of sight to any future business path, what was currently in the book. We now have a better line of sight by working closely with some of these customers and what their plans are and the future potential of the business. That's really what I was going after when I said that because it's something we understand a little bit better but, again, as we keep saying, we're cautious about the macro factors that drive the core demand for these products. -- That helps. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. -- Yes, thank you. The question about the revenue turns percentage that seems to have been steadily dropping, is that a function of where product lead times are now? If you could explain that relationship and basically what you're seeing from both a turns perspective, how that gives you visibility into the business and where you're seeing lead time. -- No, we don't really have any lead time issues. And actually that's one of the things our customers have appreciated about us, which is our ability to support them. I do think it's more a function of us continuing to drive the business and to get the orders on the books as soon as we can. It does help us plan and it does help us from some downside variability, if it ever occurs. This is just the way we're trying to drive the business. Not to say that it will always be this way, but we're making a deliberate effort to get the orders on the books. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. -- Hey. Thanks, guys. And, yeah, Moshe, thanks for everything over the years. Mazel Tov. Chamashevi. Anyway. That's Hebrew for those of you that don't know out there. I don't know if you guys -- I don't know if you guys went into the relative growth rates you expect in your three main end markets for the calendar year, if you could just run through those real quick. -- I'm sorry. You said for the calendar year or for the last quarter? -- For this calendar year, what's your relative growth rate expectations between Comm, Industrial, and Broadcast? -- I don't think that on this call I want to give the guidance for the quarter -- I mean for the calendar year. But in terms of where we see now in the quarter that we're in, the Industrial -- Aerospace, Industrial, A&D, that we definitely see will be a very strong quarter -- I mean overall, that basket. I think the AVB, Consumer, and Auto will be holding, slightly up, I believe. Right? -- Well, so I think -- yeah, Chris, so for the year, I mean, the calendar year is three-quarters of our next fiscal year. And like I said before, we'll do that guidance first at the end of this quarter and then more completely at Analyst's Day. But for this current quarter, the fourth quarter with respect to the third quarter, was what I had referenced in my guidance piece earlier. -- Sorry. I was talking about the fiscal year. I'm sorry. I was referring to this fiscal year, of which sub-segments was gonna show pretty strong growth. -- So I got -- I think we were both a little bit confused about the time horizon in your question. Sorry about that. but for this quarter, the Industrial, Aerospace and Defense end market set will be relatively flat-ish as the Industrial and Aerospace and Defense segment growth offsets a decline from actually a relatively -- record setting, it's not relatively. A record setting performance on Test Measurement and Emulation. The Communications and Data Center end markets will be up slightly and the Consumer, Automotive, and Broadcast business will be up and that's where, right now, we've bucketed the cryptocurrency business and that's why we spent a little bit more time explaining that. -- And that's for the quarter? -- For the quarter, right. -- Sorry. I thought you were saying when we complete the fiscal year, how it would look. -- Yeah, I'll wait for the long-term guidance for the Analyst's Day. -- Okay, yeah, great. Thanks. -- Great. Thanks, guys.Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International. -- Hey, guys, I also want to echo my congrats on the great quarter and congrats, Victor, on the promotion, and congrats, Moshe, on a great career. So I just, Victor, wanted clarification first. So you said low tens of millions from crypto. Was that per quarter or for the full year? And then I assume that that's most heavily weighted for this last quarter here. And then also the 30% growth in Broadcast, Consumer, and Auto. Great job there and I know Dave already asked about Auto growth here. But what was Consumer growth year-over-year and Broadcast growth? Thanks. -- So, I guess, in general, in terms of the cryptocurrency, like we said, that kind of came from a very low number to in that order of tens pretty quickly. So when you sort of said was that on a quarterly basis, actually that would be for the whole year but it kind of came up from, a year ago, virtually zero. So, yeah, so the answer to the first part is yes. It was stronger in the recent quarter but for the year it would still be in that order of magnitude. -- So the other aspects of the business, the AVB end markets are on the order of 10% up and the Consumer business is up substantially more. But I think again there's some data anomalies that you wouldn't want to -- you wouldn't want to use that as a predictor of the future just because of the way that business had bounced around historically. -- Yeah, again, as you know, Consumer is a very, in general, opportunistic one for us. That isn't -- we definitely, when we see certain opportunities, go after it. On the other hand, that doesn't have the kind of emphasis that we have in some of the other markets. And, again, we flagged the crypto because that became from, quickly, essentially zero to something that we wanted to flag. -- Yeah, I certainly understand you don't want to leave anything on the table. Thanks, guys. -- Yeah, we won't do that.You have a follow-up question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. -- Yeah, guys, thanks for letting me ask the follow-up. Just quickly on the balance sheet. Inventories were up a little bit more than I would have thought and so were receivables. And so, Lorenzo, I know you talked about not having any availability issues. Is this just the new norm for inventory? What should we expect going into the March quarter or how should we think about that? Thank you. -- Yeah, so in general, you will see our inventory grow in anticipation of the business. We've had -- I think there was one quarter in the past we actually had a higher dollar value of inventory. That was for a specific business area. I think that was when we were getting ready to support Wireless ramp in the last generation. Again, I think that was the case. But we see just, in general, broader end market strength, particularly in our Advanced Products and that's where we're focusing our inventory builds. So I think the inventory number is quite consistent with what you'll see in the business. It should grow as the business grows. But in periods it will drain down a little bit and in others, it will build up a little bit, just depending on what we're actually seeing in the market. On AR, this has been a story that I've told a couple of time. It is relatively high and it is, again, driven by how consumers make shipments during the quarter and payment patterns. I will reassure you all we have no collectability issues on the AR. So it's just high quality and it's purely a timing thing. -- Perfect. Thanks, guys.Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. -- Hi. This is Vinayak Rao calling in for Joe. I wanted to follow up on your ADAS business. Now that's one space where you have seen good traction for using product. So when you look at your customer design pipeline, just discuss how have the end applications for ADAS evolved over time and what are the applications you're most excited about going forward? -- ADAS, again, has been, as I mentioned for Zynq, Automotive is one of the areas that we have significant strength. For the most part, this is all 28-nm by the way, right. And of course, the ADAS requirements in the market keep going up. They keep raising the safety standard so there's already been quite a bit of activity and design-ins for the next generation ADAS. As everybody knows, there's also a lot of development and excitement around autonomous driving. And these things are evolving from advanced driver assist systems toward the autonomous driving. So we have a natural set of relationships, design activities, and, in fact, some winds, frankly, that move us along that whole continuum of the earlier advanced driver assist systems to more sophisticated ones to the early level of autonomous driving.So, yes, I think that we're definitely participating in that entire evolution. Because of our flexibility, we are participating in all the major sub-portions of the architecture, meaning like we have engagements where we're in the central unit, we have engagements where we're out by some of the sensors, aggregation points, and so forth. So, yeah, we are quite well-engaged there and think that's one of the definite areas where Zynq has gotten very good traction. First generation and then our 16-nm MPSoC as well. -- Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.You have another follow-up question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. -- Hey, guys, thanks for letting me ask another. I just want to follow up on the March guidance for Consumer. Given you said your Comm bucket would be up slightly, then that bucket, it seems like, should be up double digits. And obviously we talked about cryptocurrency. I'm just trying to understand how strong Automotive is because that business has had kind of an unpredictable path. Typically it's seasonally strong but it sometimes is up larger. If you could just look at that sequential growth into March and maybe kind of get any color between the segments there. -- Yeah, that set of end markets on a percentage basis, the Consumer aspect will grow the most substantial, as you just pointed out. Both AVB and Auto will grow in the low single digits. -- Very helpful. Thanks. -- Victoria, we can take one more question.Certainly. Your last question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities. -- Thank you for squeezing me in. Moshe, let me echo my congrats and again thanks for all your help over the years. Just a quick question. I know you guys don't make CPUs but you do sit next to a lot of them. Just curious if the recent security issues with Meltdown inspector, if you're seeing any impact one way or the other, directly or indirectly, in the near term and do you expect any impact from those issues? -- Yeah, I know that's quite a lively topic. And, of course, we led the industry in integrating an RMSoC in all programmable FPGAs. And as you know, we licensed those cores from ARM. So I will say that we absolutely know that there is no known susceptibilities of the Xilinx specific implementations of the ARM cores that we licensed from ARM. And according to their information -- we work very closely with ARM. We don't believe there's any susceptibility to the Meltdown aspect of it. Right? Regarding Spectre, there's no known susceptibility in terms of the 16-nm Zynq MPSoC. And in terms of the first generation Zynq SoC, we used there the ARM Cortex A9, which has the possibility of having some of that, however I would point out that most of our customers do enclosed, embedded systems. Right? And if that's the case, then it's highly unlikely that there would be exposure to that.In addition, if the customer does have something get user, kind of code exposure, if they use authentication and security features that are there, then that exposure is also the same thing, highly unlikely. We haven't heard anything from customers but, of course, you monitor that very closely and we're working with ARM very closely on any further news or mitigation. Just to round out the bases by the way, we've had our proprietary MicroBlaze, self-embedded processor. We know that there is no vulnerability there. That architecture is very simplistic so there's no vulnerability in either the Meltdown or the Spectre. So does that -- -- Yeah, that's very helpful. Yeah. That's it. -- Great.

" (LRCX) delivered the ""earnings trifecta"" on January 24 and shares suffered a stunning reversal of fortune the next day after nearly touching their 52-week high just below $220. I believe this profit-taking is presenting an excellent buying opportunity and this report will explain why.The triple play of earnings goodness I refer to is both top and bottom lines beats  raised guidance for the current quarter, as well as a generally sunny outlook for the coming year.Lam reported Q2 FY2018 (ends in June) EPS of $4.34 vs the Zacks consensus of $3.69 for a 17.6% beat.The company did take a write-down of $757 million to offset tax code changes affecting its over $2.5 billion in overseas cash. So that shows up as an unadjusted loss for the quarter of 6-cents.Revenue in the December quarter rose 37% year-over-year to $2.58 billion vs. analyst models projecting $2.567 billion.Lam Research generates the majority of its revenue in Asia with large customers like  (MU) and Samsung.After reflecting on another quarter of record results, Lam Research CEO Martin Anstice said the company expects 2018 to bring ""record levels of customer equipment spending and another year of outperformance opportunity for the company.""For the current Q3, Lam management sees revenue in a range of $2.73 billion to $2.98 billion, $200 million ahead (at the midpoint) of the consensus $2.65 billion estimate. EPS is seen in a range of $4.20 to $4.50, versus the Zacks consensus for $3.81.While LRCX is currently a Zacks #2 Rank Buy, the company's raised guidance will inspire Wall Street analysts to start reworking their models and raise their sales and EPS estimates. Within a few days, we should see the Q3 consensus climb 10-15% and get close to that $4.35 midpoint.The full fiscal year (ending in June) should see estimates rise over $15, representing nearly 50% EPS growth and keeping the P/E multiple under 14X.And as top line estimates climb over $10.5 billion, Lam is looking at full-year sales growth of over 30%.CEO Anstice also noted that ""semiconductor innovation is contributing increased value in a data-driven economy and we believe that trend is quite fundamental, exciting and sustainable.""This sounds exactly like the outlook of my December 11 special report for Zacks Confidential,  , where I recommended LRCX shares under $185.The recent 2018 Barron's Roundtable had as one of its stock-pickers Scott Black, founder of Delphi Management and an old-school value guy. Here's what he said about why you own the Lam...""It is a powerhouse in semiconductor capital equipment, and its products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which is becoming a $50 billion business. Lam has a 56%-57% market share in wafer etch, and about a 40% share in vapor deposition. It wants to gain another four percentage points in both through 2019.""Black also addressed Lam's cash position noting the company has $22 a share in net cash with over 70% (approximately $2.8 billion) trapped overseas. ""Exclude that and the stock sells for 11.6 times earnings. It is a giveaway. The average company sells for 19 times earnings, and LAM isn't an average company.""Black describes Lam as having the ""wind at its back"" across multiple industries experiencing strong demand, from memory and flash to the cloud and IoT. And he thinks these growth areas provide positive earnings visibility going out two years.The negative market reaction in Lam shares immediately following earnings is a bit of a puzzle. Until, that is, you think about the traditional fear in this industry, which saw the Philly Semiconductor Index (SOX) retreat 4% from its all-time highs on Wednesday and Thursday as other chip and equipment makers like  (AMAT),  (XLNX) and  (AVGO) also fell between 2% and 5% on Thursday.Technology investors are still prone to seeing a very cyclical industry with brief periods of boom followed buy busts. But this isn't the 1990s and we aren't talking about desktop computers driving demand.This is the age of mobile, datacenters, automotive innovations, robotics and automation, and artificial intelligence. These areas are not slowing down and should provide investors enough visibility that they might think twice and give my ""technology super cycle"" the benefit of the doubt.But one of the big fears for Lam is that memory chip supply will saturate demand in 2019. Since that's about two-thirds of Lam's business, investors are probably somewhat justified in wondering if this is ""as good as it gets"" and the big double-digit growth rates we are accustomed to will drop hard and fast in the next year.So far, that's not what the investment bank semiconductor analysts are seeing or saying. Here were some of their price target raises as they see the growth trends as ""exciting and sustainable"" as CEO Anstice does..Royal Bank of Canada: from $225 to $245KeyBanc: from $225 to $261Deutsche Bank: from $220 to $240JPMorgan: from $230 to $260Morgan Stanley: from $229 to $238Needham & Company: from $235 to $270Stifel Nicolaus: from $235 to $260Credit Suisse: from $245 to $275Susquehanna: from $250 to $260B.Riley: from $250 to $270Nomura/Instinet: from $230 to $250Price target hikes are nice, but what savvy investors can really sink their teeth into are rising sales and profit estimates. We'll be watching those filter into the Zacks Detailed Estimates page over the coming days and hopefully those numbers will reward those like me who are buying the dip.Disclosure: I own LRCX shares for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 rose solidly Thursday morning after the Nasdaq composite slumped Wednesday on  (  ) and weakness in chips fueled by  (  ).Late Wednesday, chip-equipment giant  (  ) and chipmaker  (  ) reported blowout earnings and bullish guidance, sending the stocks near or into buy zones overnight. But chip-gear maker  (  ) tumbled on guidance that fell short of estimates.[ibd-display-video id=3037819 width=50 float=left autostart=true] S&P 500 index futures and Dow futures climbed nearly 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.45%.Apple shares fell 1.6% to 174.22 in Wednesday's  , dropping back below a 175.34 flat-base buy point. The stock did find support at its 50-day moving average, as it has since the last days of 2017. But volume was the highest since Nov. 3 and was the heaviest trade in a down session since September.Meanwhile, the  , which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, fell yet again. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Already at consolidation lows, Apple's RS line is now approaching longer-term levels.

Revenue rose 37% to $2.58 billion, just above analyst forecasts for $2.57 billion.For fiscal Q3 ending in April, Lam Research expects EPS of $4.20-$4.50 and revenue of $2.73 billion to $2.98 billion. Wall Street was looking for EPS of $3.81 and revenue of $2.66 billion.Lam Research shares rose 4.7% to 219.50 in early Thursday trading after falling 2.5% to 209.73 on Wednesday. The stock had rallied in the prior six sessions.Lam's after-hours action suggests the stock could test its 219.80  . Lam's RS line remains off its highs near the left side of the consolidation. But the RS line has made some progress, clearing some short-term highs.Lam's results follow strong earnings and a bullish outlook from  (ASML) last week, as well as strong preliminary revenue figures and sales guidance from  (ICHR) and  (ESIO). (KLAC), which is at the edge of a buy zone, reports earnings Thursday.Xilinx earned 76 cents a share excluding various items and a tax-related charge, up 46% vs. a year earlier. That was the best gain in four years and easily beat fiscal third-quarter views for 63 cents. Revenue rose 8% to $631.2 million vs. views for $630 million. That's just OK, but is the best top-line growth in five quarters.For the current quarter, Xilinx sees revenue of $635 million to $665 million. That $650 million midpoint is above Wall Street forecasts and would be a 6.7% yearly gain.Xilinx rose 4.8% to 78 in  , suggesting a move back above a 75.24 buy point. Xilinx fell out of buy range on Wednesday, losing 2.7% to 73.48.The RS line is definitely a concern. It's well below the consolidation's high and hasn't made headway for the past year. A powerful price move Thursday could push the RS line over short-term levels.Teradyne earned 46 cents a share in its fourth quarter on sales of $479 million vs. views for 34 cents and $438 million, respectively. The chip-equipment maker also hiked its quarterly dividend by 29% to 9 cents a share.But Teradyne gave EPS and revenue guidance that, at the midpoint, is below the consensus.Teradyne shares fell 5.7% to 44.99 in late trading but were not yet active early Thursday. The stock had closed down 3.4% to 46.79, moving back into buy range from a 44.72 entry.Extended trading doesn't always carry over to the next regular session, but Teradyne looks set to test its buy point.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Apple Falls Below Buy Point; These Two Chip Stocks Soar On Earnings: S&P 500 Futures@2018-01-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-falls-below-buy-point-these-two-chip-stocks-soar-earnings-sp-500-futures-2018-01-24

" is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Xilinx has delivered positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 5.4%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 63 cents, which represents a 21.2% increase from the year-ago figure of 52 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $630 million, up 7.6% from the prior-year quarter.We expect field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) products to drive Xilinx's third-quarter sales aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in the Automotive and Aerospace and Defense markets. | Xilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of FPGA replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company's revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in the communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors, such as wired communication, data center and industrial, will stoke revenue growth.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior.Most of the emerging economies are witnessing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and are also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in the Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will lead to heightened demand for Xilinx's 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, thereby positively impacting its overall fiscal third-quarter results.Nonetheless, flaring up operating expenses related to tape-outs is likely to weigh on the to-be-reported quarter's profitability. In addition, management's pessimistic view over business conditions in India and China, two of its fastest growing markets, remains a concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an ESP of -0.57%.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Facebook, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Microsoft Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank #2.Apple Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #3.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $67.75, changing hands for $67.91/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $45.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $80.00. The standard deviation is $9.235.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $67.75/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $67.75 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

"n 2013, chip giant  (NASDAQ: INTC) and programmable logic chip vendor Altera announced a collaboration whereby Intel would manufacture chips Altera designs. This move, Altera hoped, would give it an edge over rival  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , which relies on contract chip manufacturer  (NYSE: TSM) to build its chips.Altera's pitch to investors was simple: Since Intel's then-upcoming 14-nanometer chip manufacturing technology was superior to TSMC's then-upcoming 16-nanometer chip technology, Altera could leverage Intel's technology to build better products than Xilinx could, thereby driving market share gains for Altera.Image source: Intel.Two years later, Intel announced that it intended to acquire Altera. The acquisition closed in late 2015, and Altera became the Intel Programmable Solutions Group (PSG).During a recent  , Intel PSG chief Dan McNamara admitted that Altera, as a standalone entity, struggled to get chips built on TSMC's 20-nanometer completed on schedule, which led to a push out in the development timeline of the follow-on product built using Intel's 14-nanometer technology.Fortunately, according to McNamara, it looks as if this situation won't repeat with Intel's upcoming 10-nanometer FPGA family, code-named Falcon Mesa.""So, immediately, day one and working with [Intel CEO Brian Krzanich] and some of the [technology and manufacturing group] folks, we decided we needed to go parallel immediately,"" McNamara said.By this, the executive is referring to the idea that the company would have two distinct product teams working on two successive generations of products at a time -- or, in other words, in parallel. Such a development methodology has obvious benefits: If the product that's scheduled to come out earlier gets delayed, then that doesn't necessarily mean the follow-on product gets delayed, too.This development methodology change looks as if it could pay off for the company.Intel began sending out samples of its first 14-nanometer field-programmable gate array (FPGA), branded the Stratix 10 ,  , and began shipping production versions of the chip to customers back in October.McNamara says the company has been working on 10-nanometer FPGAs for two years -- which is unsurprising, since it's been two years since Intel closed its acquisition of Altera -- and expects to begin sending out samples of those chips next year.Image source: Intel.My guess is that Intel will begin sampling those 10-nanometer FPGAs in late 2018, with production shipments commencing a year later in late 2019.Intel has made it clear that it believes the company that's first to migrate its FPGAs to a new manufacturing technology will have a market share advantage during the life of those chips in the marketplace.Intel's 10-nanometer technology is roughly equivalent to TSMC's upcoming 7-nanometer technology, so to gauge Intel's potential competitiveness, it's useful to understand what Xilinx has said about its plans around its FPGAs built using TSMC's 7-nanometer technology.Xilinx doesn't appear to have given a specific timeline, but according to  , Xilinx has indicated that it intends to have its first products built on TSMC's 7-nanometer tech ""ready by early 2018.""My guess, then, is that Xilinx will begin sampling its 7-nanometer FPGAs in the first half of 2018, edging out Intel, and will begin commercial shipments a year later -- once again, beating out Intel.So in terms of transitioning to a manufacturing technology roughly equivalent to Intel's 10-nanometer, Xilinx seems to have an edge, which -- going by Intel's own claims -- should allow it to have market share leadership during that product generation.Intel's best bet, then, is to try to be less behind Xilinx during the 10-nanometer generation than it was during the 14-nanometer generation to  between the two companies.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With high-flying chip names such as Micron () and Nvidia () leading the way, semiconductor stocks were one of 2017’s best-performing groups.Despite ending the year on a rough note, where the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) declined almost 7% in late November, the SOX still crushed the broader market, posting 2017 returns of almost 40%, besting the 25% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a better-than 19% return in the S&P 500 Index. But as Lay’s has told us, when it comes to chips, you can’t eat just one.In that vein, unlike previous years, it was just the sexy growth chip names that dominated 2017. Even traditional powers like Intel (), which rose 30%, ranking as one of the better-performing Dow components, participated in the rally. Thanks to its  of Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye, Intel wrote its own narrative as a force to be reckoned with in the autonomous car market, which has become the new battleground for high-tech companies looking new revenue streams.Where Intel thrived Advanced Micro Devices (), which was an early chip favorite in 2017, ended the year on a sour note. This is even though the company’s earnings during 2017 were consistently above expectations. In Q3 the company crushed estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Yet, the stock took a pounding, falling — at one point — more than 15%. Investors were fearful about the company’s lower Q4 guidance, which overlooked that the fourth quarter, with its implied sequential revenue decline, was seasonally weak and has little to do with business fundamentals.Nevertheless, in this fickle market where tons of other growth options exist, investors opted to go elsewhere. And it would seem Micron (up 85% in 2017) — a stock  on March 23 at around $26 per share — and Nvidia (up almost 80%) were the beneficiaries. The former, which I proudly own, is operating on its stated objectives and better-diversifying the business, which — in my opinion — effectively removes the threat of what has been a highly cyclical industry for DRAM and NAND memory chip pricing.For Nvidia, few expected it would follow a colossal 2016 performance, during which it posted returns of 235%, with 2017 returns of almost 80%. But thanks to successes in high-growth markets like artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, where its chips are at the center of autonomous driving technology, the company posted breathtaking top- and bottom line growth results throughout 2017, which has now crushed Wall Street's estimates the past two years.Elsewhere Broadcom () — though it didn’t get nearly the attention as Micron and Nvidia — was a clear winner. With better than 45% returns, the wireless giant, which has chip placement in both Apple () and Samsung () products, gives it an advantage over competitors. And its $130 billion offer for Qualcomm (), which if completed, would be the biggest-ever tie-up in the tech sector, suggest Broadcom has no plans to rest in search of value-creating opportunities.Which companies will be this year’s Micron, Nvidia or Broadcom? Though it’s early, I expect AMD to have a bounce-back year. Other names to keep an eye on include Analog Devices (), Cavium (), Texas Instruments (), and Xilinx ().Granted, as evidenced by their strong performances in 2017, lead by Texas Instrument’s 44% gain, these four are not in the discount bins. But not only are they solid in terms of execution (not one missed analysts top or bottom-line estimates in 2017), they each have extensive product portfolios, containing assets that serve multiple applications within primary end markets such as enterprise storage, industrials, wired and wireless businesses, which are all growing at double-digit rates.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Semiconductor Stocks: Year In Review; Where to Place Your Chips in 2018@2018-01-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/semiconductor-stocks-year-review-where-place-your-chips-2018-2018-01-05

eep learning is a subsegment of artificial intelligence (AI) in which multiple computers to talk to each other through  . These artificial neural networks allow computers to understand random information without any prior programming, and  's (NASDAQ: XLNX) field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are ideal for powering the deep learning of applications such as self-driving cars. FPGAs are integrated circuits that are programmed after they are made.Xilinx's business has taken off remarkably since last year. The chipmaker has benefited from its technology lead over rival  (NASDAQ: INTC) . data by More importantly, Xilinx isn't going to run out of steam anytime soon. The company is pulling the right strings in the right areas to attack the growing use of FPGAs, especially in the field of deep learning.Image Source: Getty ImagesIt is commonly thought that graphics processing units (GPUs) are necessary for training deep learning models as they can perform thousands of operations concurrently. CPUs are also in the mix, but they have a lot fewer cores than a GPU.But it is believed that FPGAs could match or beat GPUs in deep learning thanks to their programmable nature. A FPGA  to perform a variety of tasks after manufacturing, giving developers the flexibility to optimize them for specific models, which isn't possible with a GPU.Furthermore, FPGAs deliver stronger performance for each watt of power consumed. So they could be the chipset of choice in large-scale deployments such as data centers, where energy efficiency is key. As a result, FPGA deployment for deep learning applications is expected to gain momentum over the next few years.Tractica's estimates suggest that FPGAs were almost non-existent in deep learning applications until last year, but they will equal (if not exceed) CPU deployments in this space by 2025. As a result, FPGAs could carve a greater share of the $12.2 billion deep learning chipset market by 2025, setting the stage for Xilinx to significantly boost its revenue given its lead in this space.Xilinx's biggest competitor in the FPGA space was Altera, which is now a part of Intel. But Intel  on the FPGA technology curve, and the latter is currently working to further extend its lead by moving to a smaller process node. Chips manufactured on a smaller process node ideally perform faster, consume less power, and are less expensive to manufacture.This is why Xilinx claims to have built an 18-month technology lead over Intel by shipping more than 14 types of 16nm chips to over 450 customers. Xilinx had 200 customers for its 16nm chips at the end of 2016, when Intel had just about launched its 14nm chips.Therefore, Xilinx's chips are still in strong demand despite Intel launching a chip that's based on a smaller node. In fact, Xilinx's 16nm chips were on the market for a year already when Intel had commercially launched its own solution.This technology lead has helped Xilinx increase its market share in programmable logic devices to 59% at the end of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2017. By comparison, the company had 52% of the market under its control at the end of 2011.Furthermore, Xilinx can grab a greater share of this market as it has already started testing a chip based on the 7nm process. While Xilinx was announcing its 7nm chip in September this year, Intel disclosed that it has started the production run of test chips based on the 10nm platform. This indicates that Xilinx will continue to enjoy a technology lead over Intel in FPGAs, which is why it is confident of boosting its market share to a range of 60%-65% by 2021.More specifically, Xilinx believes that the market share gains will add $250 million to its annual revenue by fiscal year 2021. Meanwhile, the secular growth in the end market thanks to the growing deployment of FPGAs in deep learning applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) could add another $500 million in revenue.By comparison, Xilinx has generated almost $2.4 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months and top-line growth will eventually filter down to the bottom line. Analysts expect Xilinx's annual earnings growth rate to more than double in the next five years as compared to the last five, which indicates stronger upside potential going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including AbbVie (ABBV), Union Pacific (UNP) and Bristol-Myers (BMY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have gained +44.1% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which has gained +14.6% over the same period. AbbVie reported mixed Q3 results. While earnings beat estimates, revenues came in line. Humira and Imbruvica kept up the strong performance.Meanwhile, AbbVie raised its earnings outlook for the year backed by a strong year-to-date performance. Despite new competition, it raised its long-term target for Humira sales based on strong demand trends for the drug.The Zacks analyst stresses that the past 2-3 months have been strong for the company as it presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbrivica and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen.Also, several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018. However, HCV sales continue to be hurt by intensifying competition.(You can  .Shares of Buy-rated  have outperformed the Zacks Rail Transportation Industry as well as fellow railroad operator Kansas City Southern over the last three months. While the company has gained +13.1%, the industry in belongs to and Kansas City Southern have rallied +8.3% and +2.1%, respectively, so far this year.Ushering in further good news, Union Pacific reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the third quarter of 2017. Results were aided by strong performances of the company's intermodal and industrial products units.The Zacks analyst is impressed by the company's efforts to cut costs to drive its bottom line as well. Efforts to reward investors also raise optimism in the stock. However, declining coal revenues in the third quarter raise concerns. Automotive volumes also decreased due to sluggish vehicle production in the United States.(You can  .Strong Buy-rated  shares have underperformed the broader market as well as the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry this year, gaining only +5.5% in the year-to-date period. Bristol-Myers reported mixed results for the third-quarter with earnings missed expectations although revenue beat on the same. The miss in earnings was attributable to lower gross margin which in turn was due to product mix and decline in virology business.The Zacks analyst thinks the increase in earnings guidance is encouraging. The company's blockbuster immuno-oncology Opdivo continues to perform well along with Eliquis and Orencia. The company is looking to expand Opdivo's label further and recently won FDA approvals for liver and colorectal cancers which should boost performance.The company is also looking to counter generic threat for its key drugs through deals and acquisitions. The company recently entered into a deal with AbbVie and Halozyme. However, Opdivo is currently facing competitive challenges in the United States. The virology business is also under pressure.(You can  .Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Xilinx (XLNX), Weyerhaeuser (WY) and Colgate (CL).It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

 reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 65 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by three cents. The figure increased 6.6% from the year-ago quarter and 3.2% from the previous quarter.This year-over-year growth has been primarily driven by higher revenues, while the sequential increase benefited from the modest top-line growth and lower cost of revenues, partially offset by elevated operating expenses.Despite this shares of Xilinx dropped approximately 4.7% during yesterday's after-hour trade as revenues marginally fell short of the company's own guidance range at the mid-point. For the reported quarter, the company recorded revenues of $619.5 million, marginally below the mid-point of its guidance range of $605-$635 million (mid-point $620 million).However, quarterly revenues came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked year-over-year growth of 7% and sequential increase of 0.7%. | Management noted that Xilinx's revenues increased for the eighth consecutive quarter reflecting product strength. This uptick was primarily driven by robust performance of the company's 16nm, 20nm and 28nm products.Product wise, Advanced product revenues jumped a whopping 21% year over year and 1% sequentially.

However, the contribution remained flat when compared with the previous quarter.The robust performance of Advanced products was mainly driven by strong demand for its Zynq SoC platform and 20-nm and 16-nm nodes. Revenues from the Zynq SoC platform recorded 65% year-over-year growth and contributed 12% to total revenues, backed by robust demand in wireless, primarily for pre-5G deployments.The 20-nm sales were up 40% year over year in the reported quarter, chiefly driven by strength in multiple end markets.However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the top performer in the quarter, registering a four-fold jump in revenues. The company shipped 34 unique products to more than 930 discrete customers across all end markets.Revenues from core products declined 5% from the year-ago quarter, however inched up 1% sequentially.On the basis of the End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (37% of total revenue) dipped 5% year over year and 10% sequentially. The industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (45% of total revenue) climbed 17% on a year-over-year basis and 7% on a sequential basis. The broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (18% of total revenue) ascended 12% year over year and 11% sequentially.Geographically, the company registered year-over-year growth in every region. Revenues from Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe and North America were up 14%, 12%, 4% and 1%, respectively. Nevertheless, sequentially, Asia Pacific was weak, declining 7%. This was fully offset by robust growth from North America, Japan and Europe, which advanced 8%, 8% and 2%, respectively.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all-programmable devices producer is helping the company gain market share. The company's expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is assisting it to counter intense competition from the likes of Intel  . The company's Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered sturdy top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx noted that it had started shipping of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product in the second quarter, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product facilitates the reduction of power consumption (50-75%), as well as footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of Amazon's  FPGA-as-a-Service (the cloud service is supported by Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGAs) that targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. Xilinx believes Amazon's deployment of SDAccel and SDSoC products will fortify its competitive position against other SoC providers.Gross margin expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 70.2% and 140 bps sequentially, and was within the company's guided range of 69-71%.Operating expenses flared up 10.2% year over year and 2.7% sequentially to $249.8 million. Nonetheless, the figure came in $3.2 million lower than the company's guidance. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 40.3%, reflecting an increase of 120 bps on a year-over-year basis and 80 bps sequentially.Escalating operating expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offset the benefit of healthy revenue growth and improved gross margin, resulting in year-over-year contraction of 60 bps in operating margin which came in at 29.9%. Nonetheless, on a sequential basis, operating margin improved 60 bps mainly driven by higher gross margin.In dollars, the company posted operating income of $185.2 million, up 4.7% year over year and 2.6% sequentially.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.56 billion compared with $3.65 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.74 billion, flat from the end of the previous quarter.Xilinx generated cash of $202.1 million from operations and incurred $12.2 million as capital expenditure during the second quarter. The company paid $87 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $170.5 million.In the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated cash of $393.1 million from operations and incurred $22.1 million as capital expenditure. It paid $174.3 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for $237.5 million.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx projects revenues in the range $615-$645 million (mid-point $630 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance range is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $626.5 million.Management continues to expect growth in the Advanced Products segment. Xilinx anticipates the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive end market to register a decline, while Communications will likely remain flat year over year. On the other hand, the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense end market is projected to witness growth.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to increase to $260 million, mainly due to higher research & development (R&D) expenses. Tax rate is projected between 11% and 14%.The company remains focused on achieving its fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. Xilinx also expects to deliver more than 30% of operating margin exiting this fiscal year.We believe the rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes is a positive for the company. Also, a favorable product mix (higher Industrial, lower wireless) will help in gross-margin expansion in the near term.Xilinx's expanding software defined programming portfolio, along with hardware solutions, to accelerate machine learning is anticipated to drive user base. The company has significant growth opportunities in Data center, 5G deployment, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial IoT and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) applications over the long haul.However, growth from wireless is expected to remain volatile until 2020, which is a concern. Escalating operating expenses related to tape-outs might weigh on the company's profitability in the near future.In addition to this, management's pessimistic view over business conditions in India and China, two of its fastest growing markets, is another grave concern.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation  , sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

 's (NASDAQ: XLNX) second-quarter results turned out to be a mixed bag, but this hasn't dented investors' confidence in the stock given the chipmaker's  . The company missed Wall Street's top-line expectations by a whisker, reporting $620 million in revenue as compared to $579 million in the year-ago quarter.However, Xilinx beat the bottom-line forecast by a couple of cents as its earnings jumped from $0.61 per share last year to $0.65 per share during the second quarter. Throw in strong quarterly guidance that calls for $630 million in revenue at the midpoint as compared to Wall Street's $626 million expectation and it isn't surprising to see why Xilinx stock has continued its upward trajectory after the quarterly report was released on Oct. 25.But there's more to the company than just the quarterly numbers and short-term guidance. The company has been setting itself up for long-term growth by targeting the fast-growing FPGA (field-programmable gate array) chip market. A closer look at some of the key trends highlighted by Xilinx management on the latest  tells us that it is moving in the right direction.Image Source: Getty ImagesXilinx's revenue from sales of its advanced products (UltraScale+, Ultrascale, and 7-series products) shot up 21% year over year during the second quarter. These products now supply 52% of the top line as compared to 46% in the prior-year period, which isn't surprising as the chipmaker is targeting lucrative end markets such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).Xilinx's Zynq programmable chip has been the star of this segment. Sales of this platform shot up 65% year over year, and it now accounts for 12% of the company's total sales. More importantly, the Zynq chip platform shouldn't lose momentum anytime soon thanks to the growing adoption of FPGAs in the automotive space.FPGAs are programmable chips that can be  several tasks after they have been manufactured. The flexible architecture of FPGAs means that developers can train the chip to perform tasks that cannot be otherwise executed by a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU), as they are constrained by their fixed architecture.As a result, automakers and component suppliers are increasingly turning toward FPGAs, as these chips reduce the cost of electronic components in a vehicle. The growing adoption of FPGAs by the automotive industry has been a boon for Xilinx so far. The company claims to be the second-ranked chip supplier for the ADAS space, having shipped more than 40 million chips for this market.In fact, Xilinx's ADAS sales have grown at a 60% annual rate since fiscal year 2013, and investors can expect the trend to continue given the strong client base it has built over the years. The company's FPGAs are currently being used by 26 auto brands and 96 car models.Such strong presence in the ADAS market bodes well for Xilinx.  forecasts that ADAS-related chip content in cars will increase by $300-$400 through 2025. This isn't surprising as shipments of ADAS-related components are expected to jump from just 218 million units last year to 1.2 billion units in 2025.Therefore, Xilinx's advanced products revenue should keep increasing thanks to the secular growth of ADAS chips and the company's strong customer relationships in this space.Xilinx's revenue from the communications and data center market dropped 5% year over year in the latest quarter. This weighed on the company's top line as the segment supplies 37% of the total revenue, but investors shouldn't panic just yet as recent deals struck by the chipmaker could boost growth.Last quarter, Xilinx landed three big cloud computing clients --  Web Services (AWS),  , and  . All these cloud computing players have decided to use Xilinx's FPGAs to accelerate their infrastructure, a trend that has recently gathered momentum based on the benefits of these programmable chips.The programmable nature of the FPGAs speeds up the training process of artificial intelligence models in the cloud. Moreover, FPGAs are cost-effective because they deliver a stronger performance for each watt of energy consumed, making them ideal for deployment in a large-scale server setting where power consumption needs to be minimized.As a result, FPGA deployment in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure is set to increase through 2025. These chips are going to play a key role in powering deep learning applications in the cloud, according to Tractica's estimates, with their shipments expected to eventually match CPUs by then.The use of FPGAs across fast-growing areas such as automotive and the cloud will boost the market's revenue to $12.1 billion by 2024, up from $6.9 billion last year, as per Variant Market Research. Xilinx is in pole position to tap this growth as it controlled 59% of this market at the end of fiscal year 2017.What's more, Xilinx believes that it has the potential to increase its market share to 60%-65% over the next four years, which seems achievable given the  over archrival  . According to Xilinx, it has an 18-month lead over Intel in the FPGA arena. More importantly, the company plans to maintain this lead as it is working ambitiously to launch its 7-nanometer technology node next year.By comparison, Intel recently announced plans to develop its next-generation FPGAs on the 10-nm technology node, though it didn't provide details about a specific launch date. Therefore, Xilinx's next-generation FPGA chips will be based on a smaller technology node, which means that they should ideally consume less power, reduce manufacturing costs, and deliver an improved performance.Therefore, it isn't surprising to see why analysts expect Xilinx's annual earnings growth rate to more than double over the next five years, up from the 4% annual jump that it has delivered in the last five. Investors should be interested in the long-term upside Xilinx could enjoy from its leadership position in the FPGA market.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 25. The question lingering in investors' minds is whether this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in to-be-reported quarter. Notably, Xilinx has delivered positive earnings surprises for six straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 7.4%. So, let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 62 cents, which is a penny higher than the year-ago figure of 61 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $620 million, up 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.Our proven model conclusively shows that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has highest chance of beating estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an ESP of +0.22%. | Xilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) replacing application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs). There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs.We expect FPGA products to drive the company's revenues throughout fiscal 2018, aided by steady demand in communications industry, and continued strong adoption of its products in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors such as wired communication, data center and industrial will add to revenues.Furthermore, FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. These markets are strongly co-related with global GDP growth and spending behavior. Most of the emerging economies are seeing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, and are also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in Telecom & Wireless infrastructure. We believe higher wireless deployments across the world will lead to increased demand for Xilinx's 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, thereby positively impacting its overall fiscal second-quarter results.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.40), with the stock changing hands as low as $67.25 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XLNX makes up 3.95% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading up by about 0.7% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xilinx (XLNX) Shares Cross 2% Yield Mark@2017-10-26@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-xlnx-shares-cross-2-yield-mark-2017-10-26

"nvestors might have expected  (NASDAQ: XLNX) to set the stock market on fire this year as it is pursuing growth in the fast-growing fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. But the chipmaker has underperformed the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector so far this year despite posting steady growth in its revenue and earnings. data by The stock market has  toward Xilinx's quarterly performances even though it stands to gain big from the growing adoption of its programmable chips in data centers, automotive solutions, and  . But will the market's attitude toward Xilinx change with its upcoming fiscal second-quarter report that's due on Oct. 25? Let's take a look.Image Source: Xilinx.Xilinx doesn't expect a massive improvement in its second-quarter revenue and earnings as compared to the year-ago quarter. By its own estimates, revenue should increase 7% year over year to almost $621 million, and earnings should come in at $0.62 per share, up from $0.61 last year.The company doesn't expect a huge bump in its earnings this time around, but that's because of a spike in its operating expenses on account of an increased research and development outlay. Xilinx's operating expenses stood at $226.5 million in the second quarter last year. This line item is expected to jump over 11% to $253 million this time as the company pours more money into a new generation of chipsets to stay ahead of the competition, hence the muted bottom-line growth.But investors shouldn't get stuck on the company's second-quarter earnings performance as it has been setting itself up to tap a massive opportunity by investing in product development.Xilinx makes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are chips that  and optimized to perform any task after they are manufactured. This characteristic of FPGAs allows them to be deployed in artificial intelligence applications as they are not constrained by the fixed architecture of a graphics processing unit (GPU).More specifically, FPGAs can help bring down costs in a server setup because of their lower power consumption and speed up the data center thanks to their flexible programming architecture. Not surprisingly, the use of FPGAs in deep learning applications is expected to pick up pace rapidly by 2025.The good news for Xilinx is that FPGA adoption in the cloud is already gaining impressive traction. Earlier this month,  's cloud computing arm announced that it will use Xilinx's next-generation FPGAs to accelerate machine learning applications. In all, Alibaba's cloud customers will be able to use the new FPGA-based ""F2"" instance for a variety of applications such as video processing, data analytics, and genome mapping.In fact, the processing power of this FPGA-based cloud instance can be 30 times higher than a CPU-based server, so it won't be surprising if Alibaba keeps using more Xilinx FPGAs going forward. More importantly, Alibaba isn't the only big name cloud customer that Xilinx has.In September,  tied up with Xilinx to provide an FPGA-accelerated platform over the cloud. The cloud service provider is deploying Xilinx's FPGAs on Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Marketplace, creating a channel for distributing FPGA-accelerated solutions as a service. This could broaden the reach of FPGAs in the cloud computing space as customers can achieve a 100x jump in performance by configuring the AWS instance in accordance with Xilinx's software development tools.Additionally, even  has decided to use Xilinx FPGAs to achieve a 10x-50x acceleration in video processing, machine learning, and data analytics in its first cloud instance. All these wins clearly indicate that Xilinx is well-placed to take advantage of the FPGA boom in the cloud computing space.Xilinx is doing the right thing by pouring more money into research and development to maintain its lead in FPGAs. It currently holds a 59% market share in this space, and this bodes well from a long-term perspective.

"emiconductors are synonymous with Silicon Valley. Chip makers started popping up at the southern end of San Francisco Bay as early as the 1950s. A big draw back then as now: Stanford University and its bevy of researchers and research facilities. Today, seven of the biggest publicly traded semiconductor companies still call Silicon Valley home, with headquarters in such tech-friendly California cities as Santa Clara and San Jose.Despite the steady decline in computer sales in recent years -- semiconductors are the brains inside PCs -- all seven of these chip stocks have performed well during the current long-running bull market. In fact, six of the seven have handily outpaced the 348% total return (including dividends) of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since March 9, 2009. The seventh isn't far behind.But some Silicon Valley chip stocks have performed significantly better than others over the past eight-and-a-half years. Four of the seven have even beaten the remarkable 530% total return of the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is made up of the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market by market capitalization. Check out Silicon Valley's best semiconductor stocks of the bull market.Ticker symbol: Share price: $39.67Bull market return: 317%Dividend yield: 2.8%Headquarters: Santa Clara, Calif.Intel is the old-timer of Silicon Valley. The company was founded in 1968 and held its initial public offering in 1971. But Intel's longevity is a big reason  . Through the end of 2016, the stock has generated a staggering $259 billion in lifetime wealth for its shareholders,  , a finance professor at Arizona State University. Returns have been leaner during the current bull market as declining demand for PCs has hurt demand for Intel's semiconductors. That has forced Intel, the world's largest maker of the central processing units that serve as a PC's brain, to find new ways to generate revenue growth. The expansion of cloud-based services has been a boon, thanks to its dominance of the market for server chips. Analysts at Credit Suisse think Intel is well-positioned for the long term because of its scale and investments in research and development.Ticker symbol: Share price: $72.81Bull market return: 421%Dividend yield: 1.9%Headquarters: San Jose, Calif.Founded in 1984, Xilinx is another longtime denizen of Silicon Valley in the chip business that hasn't pulled its weight through the current bull market. Shares trail the Nasdaq-100 Index by 109 percentage points even after accounting for dividends. A change in the landscape promises better times ahead for the maker of programmable chip technology. Although Xilinx faces tough competition from Intel, investors are excited about the payoff from selling chips to Amazon.com's (  ) thriving cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services. And the boom in data centers beyond Amazon offers additional avenues of growth.Ticker symbol: Share price: $48.42Bull market return: 489%Dividend yield: 3.1%Headquarters: San Jose, Calif.It's been steady as she goes for Maxim Integrated Products' stock for much of the bull market, thanks in part to the inexorable rise of digital mobile devices. Among other areas of operation, the company, founded in 1983, supplies chips to smartphone giants Apple and Samsung. That leaves it exposed to risk if either of those partners were to have a change of plans. But Stifel analysts say the company's ongoing diversification efforts give it multiple opportunities for growth without becoming too dependent on a single customer. So while it's hard to imagine consumers abandoning their iPhone and Galaxy smartphones in droves, Maxim should be safe if they do since it depends on neither Apple nor Samsung for more than 10% of its overall business.Ticker symbol: Share price: $53.94Bull market return: 654%Dividend yield: 0.7%Headquarters: Santa Clara, Calif.Wall Street is increasingly bullish on Applied Materials. Of the 14 analysts covering the stock tracked by Zacks, 10 call it a ""Strong Buy,"" two have it a ""Buy,"" and two have it ""Hold."" There are no ""Sell"" ratings. It's easy to see where the optimism comes from. Applied Materials' core business of semiconductor equipment and services benefits from today's trends. The rise of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, mobile devices and Big Data are driving increased demand for chips. As a supplier to the companies that make the chips powering all these technologies, Applied Materials finds itself in an enviable position. The company also supplies products for making displays for TVs, tablets, computers and smartphones. And don't be fooled into thinking of Applied Materials as a relative newcomer to Silicon Valley. It was founded in Mountain View, Calif., in 1967 - a year before Intel.Ticker symbol: Share price: $189.90Bull market return: 938%Dividend yield: 1.0%Headquarters: Fremont, Calif.Shares of Lam Research have seen some ups and down along the way, but the bottom line is that this supplier of equipment to chip makers delivered outsized total stock returns since the bull market began. Analysts at Zacks Equity Research note that the company continued its impressive earnings momentum with another better-than-expected profit beat in its most recent quarter. Furthermore, analysts are raising their profit estimates. Of the 13 analysts covering the stock polled by Zacks, 9 have Lam at ""Strong Buy,"" two call it a ""Buy"" and two rate it at ""Hold."" Lam got its start in Santa Clara in 1980, making it one of the early players in the lucrative Silicon Valley semiconductor industry.Ticker symbol: Share price: $105.30Bull market return: 970%Dividend yield: 2.3%Headquarters: Milpitas, Calif.The KLA-Tencor we know today came into being in 1997 from the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments. But its experience in the semiconductor industry stretches back to the 1970s, when its predecessor companies got their respective starts. Experience has paid off. KLA-Tencor shares have delivered impressive price appreciation over the last eight-plus years of the bull market, but what really sets this Silicon Valley stock apart is an unusually generous dividend. The technology sector as a whole pays an average dividend of just 1.4%, according to Dividend.com. Suppliers of equipment to the semiconductor industry, which is what KLA-Tencor does, are even more stingy. The company's competition coughs up an average dividend yield of less than 1%. In August, KLA-Tencor hiked its quarterly dividend to 59 cents a share from 54 cents, a 9.3% increase.Ticker symbol: Share price: $194.59Bull market return: 2,426%Dividend yield: 0.3%Headquarters: Santa Clara, Calif.Much like the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, Nvidia was a unique product of the 1990s. Founded in 1993 and public since 1999, the company blossomed as computers and gaming consoles became more popular and more complex. In its early days Nvidia was primarily known in the gaming community for making high-end video graphics cards. It turns out that graphical processing units (GPUs) have a wide range of applications in today's data-rich world. From the automotive industry to mining for Bitcoins, Nvidia has customers across the business and consumer landscapes. The next big area of growth is expected to be artificial intelligence, which industry observers call the ""killer app"" for its chips. Analysts expect the company's sales to increase 30% this year, according to Thomson Reuters, while earnings per share should gain 40%. Bull market or not, it's reasonable to question whether shares in Nvidia can keep up such a torrid pace. After all, they've returned well over 2,000% in the past eight and a half years. But for now, at least, Nvidia is holding up its end of the bargain thanks to the impressive top- and bottom-line growth.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Best Silicon Valley Chip Stocks of the Bull Market@2017-10-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-silicon-valley-chip-stocks-bull-market-2017-10-17

nvestors in  (NASDAQ: INTC) have enjoyed market-drubbing returns for decades, although at various times, the chipmaker's stock has stumbled from a combination of competitive pressures, economic upheaval, and internal issues. Yet over time, it has come back to handily outperform the market.So, which companies are positioned to overcome adversity and similarly post just as dramatic increases in revenue and profits in the years to come? We asked that question of a team of Foolish investors, and they picked  (NASDAQ: XLNX) ,  (NASDAQ: FSLR) , and  (NASDAQ: AMBA) .3 2a2111aImage source: Getty Images. Artificial Intelligence is one of the hottest areas in technology at the moment. Many implementations rely on software programmed as neural networks to enable flexible learning, boosting the programs' abilities to adapt to changing information and make better decisions over time. The problem with software, though, is that it relies on hardware, and if that hardware isn't up to the changing task of what matters for the artificial intelligence application, it may no longer matter.That's where Xilinx has an opportunity to shine. As a leader in Field Programmable Gate Array technology, Xilinx makes hardware that can be reprogrammed or reconfigured to meet new demands as AI continues to evolve. Xilinx has partnered with  (NASDAQ: BIDU) to help that tech giant with its deep learning and Artificial Intelligence efforts. Baidu is leveraging Xilinx's FPGAs  , giving it the ability to reconfigure its hardware to respond to those constant changes.Through a combination of neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, your own brain builds new connections between neurons and rewires itself over time as you learn and place new demands on it. To the extent computer neural networking and artificial intelligence attempts to mimic the way biological brains work, using Field Programmable Gate Arrays to reprogram the hardware takes things one step closer. As the field is just now taking off, players like Xilinx may very well have a long runway of growth ahead.Image source: Getty Images. The knock on the solar power industry for years has been that for all of its perceived benefits -- emissions-free power, inexhaustible power source, etc. -- it still couldn't quite compete with more conventional power sources on costs. This meant the industry was incredibly reliant on subsidies, and panel manufacturers such as First Solar were consistently fighting low margins and the need to constantly innovate.Fast-forward to today, and there has been a major paradigm shift in solar's favor. Over the past eight years, the leveled cost of energy from utility-scale solar installations has declined 85%. As a result, utility-scale solar projects have a lower per megawatt-hour cost than conventional power sources without subsidies. Furthermore, the costs for large-scale installations with some form of energy storage are closing in on conventional sources as well.What this means for First Solar is that more and more utilities will look at solar as a viable option. Also, since  , the company is under slightly less pressure to keep prices lower to compete with conventional sources, which should help boost pricing power and margins over time.The thing that made Intel such a fantastic stock to own was that investors caught on at just the right time. Rapidly declining costs for semiconductors made them more ubiquitous in the 80s and 90s, which was when so much of Intel's fantastic stock performance took place. It's looking like First Solar is on the cusp of a similar situation in the solar power industry, and it could lead to incredible returns for investors.Image source: Getty Images. We knew the loss of  as a customer was going to be a blow for Ambarella, and that its stock would reflect the action camera maker's decision to bring its chipmaking business in-house. But the 20% cut in Ambarella's stock value after reporting earnings due to  -- despite an otherwise strong showing -- shows how the chipmaker has gone from hero to zero.This is great for investors with a long-term horizon, because the new lower price provides a great buy-in opportunity for a company that should be able to show dramatic growth in the future.Ambarella is in the midst of growing out its first computer-vision SOC, CV1, which will greatly enhance its efforts to become an integral part of the self-driving car phenomenon. Congress just passed a bill authorizing their use, which will pave the way for their becoming a commonplace reality. And Ambarella has also reportedly had the chip make the rounds to key customers in IP security and drone markets.The chipmaker's guidance for the year forecasts a horrible fourth quarter, but investors should have been aware that this year wasn't going to be pretty anyway. With its stock crushed by the reaction, Ambarella now trades at 25 times trailing earnings and 18 times estimates, yet analysts are still expecting it to grow earnings by at least 16% annually for the next five years.Once the market fully digests the new path Ambarella is on, sentiment will turn once more and make the chipmaker's stock a hero again.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Xilinx is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for XLNX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 63 cents per share for XLNX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for XLNX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.22% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  )Given that XLNX has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Xilinx, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

Technology has advanced so far so quickly that we’ve effectively entered a second wave of advancement. Our economy has been irrevocably altered by the ease and speed of decisions, connections, and deliveries made through a relatively new cyber universe of savvy vendors. Did anyone 10 years ago think that “uber” would be used as a verb (it wasn’t even a noun until the ride-sharing app became a household name)?The Nasdaq-100 index boasts some of the most technologically innovative companies in the world. Among our index members are some of the companies that have changed the way we look at the world. And they’re not slowing down. is the most heavily weighted stock in the Nasdaq-100 and with a market value of more than $750 billion it’s not hard to see why. The Cupertino, California-based company revolutionized the way consumers use technology. With its popularization of the iPhone, it made the smart phone an indispensable item for millions of people. And it has also set the template for consumer-facing electronics companies, in that it is always working on the next version.Two years from now, there will be an iPhone that has features you may only talk about. Its constant reinvention has Apple listed on one of the most innovative companies by numerous publications. Indicative of the company’s ability to dominate an industry is its recent release of the AirPods, wireless ear buds that cost much more than many products on the market. In less than one month after being launched, AirPods accounted for a quarter of all online wireless headphone revenue. Apple’s cycle of reinvention goes back to its origins, when it began making commercially-available computers to compete with existing computers from Altair and later IBM.The company has no fewer than eight new products slated to become available in 2017. Its offerings include a new version of the Apple Watch as well as new versions of the iPad Pro, the MacBook Pro and an Apple Car (or possible self-driving auto software)., the parent company of ubiquitous search engine Google, is a firebrand of innovation.

Allo is the first product to feature Google’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant technology. One of the additional applications of AI involves photo storage. Google developed Rapid and Accurate Image Super Resolution (RAISR) technology that forecasts how a photo can be magnified based on a history of other photos. It is working to bring Internet connectivity to remote parts of the globe with its Project Loon.This has extended with a foray into space exploration with its Titan, an Internet drone project that has since been folded into Project Loon. Google’s innovation has expanded to the medical field as well. It announced earlier this year that it had partnered with the Gates Foundation and the Gavi Matching Fund to assist startup Nexleaf Analytics strengthen vaccine cold chain equipment for developing countries. has experienced tremendous change over the course of its life. It has maneuvered through the changing eras of technology and reinvented itself several times in the process, being one of the first to offer the kind of networking equipment needed to power much of the Internet. It has not stopped its innovative ways and put itself on the forefront of security technology by incorporating security functionality into its branch office routing products.Cisco took a great step towards integration in the release in 2016 of its Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA). The Cisco DNA product enables the deployment and managing of an entire network through a software-based architecture that drives analytics, automation, and security. It also developed a Cloud Defense Orchestrator to manage security via the cloud. This lead on security is very forward-thinking in that it is focused on making security policy management much easier. Ease of use and integrated approach are two of the hallmarks of what security experts cite in what makes for effective policy. came to dominate social media and helped launch a new era of technology-based interaction.

Not only does the company constantly update its own flagship platform, it has sought to explore new technologies and remain an innovative power. It recently announced that it would open its first startup incubator in Paris, working on between 10 and 15 new projects every six months. The facility, located in an abandoned train station and named Station X, will help the company make contact with potential acquisitions early on in their life cycle.Late last year the company began bringing on the first wave of universities as part of a series of innovation partnerships called Sponsored Academic Research Agreements (SARA) to support Facebook’s Building 8 hardware product development group. A total of 17 universities have signed SARA agreements with Facebook: Arizona State University, Caltech, Georgia Tech, Harvard, Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, MIT, Northeastern, Rice, Stanford, Texas A&M, University of California – Berkeley, University of California - San Francisco, University Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Waterloo (Canada), and Virginia Tech. Facebook’s projects include the development of a solar-powered drone and its own connectivity satellite. It is also working on back-end open rack network infrastructure switch, mobile virtual reality headsets, and a 360-degree camera.Software designer  has products that have come to dominate their fields and are household names for managing complex finances with ease. It has kept in motion and continued to tap technology to make development easier.The company follows a “Design for Delight” philosophy and embraced broad development and vast experimentation.It launched an open platform in December 2016 to enable developers work with the nearly 30 million users of its flagship TurboTax Online product, with the aim of driving innovation in financial services. Refusing to stand still despite having dominance in the tax software sector, it announced a host of platform integrations and partnerships that would enable continued growth within its industry. Its software can integrate with Apple Pay, PayPal and Google and automated billing companies such as Bill.com.Open source is also the way of . Late in 2016 it launched its Xccela Consortium to help advance high- speed, low signal count octal interface bus and ecosystem. The consortium is aimed at semiconductor and electronics companies and it will promote the Xccela Bus interface as an open standard for a new type of digital interconnect and data bus viable for volatile and non-volatile memories as well as other integrated circuits.It was following up a move earlier in the year when it introduced its Micron Accelerated Solutions product that simplified the path to next-generation all-flash data centers. It was launched along with its Austin, Texas-based Micron Storage Solutions Center (MSSC), a hub for Micron storage innovation. It also announced a new portfolio of solid state drives that leveraged its high-performance NVMe protocol. created an operating system that continues to define personal computer use for most of the world. It is one of the leading companies that helped create our current technological age. It has continued to dominate the world of tech innovation and work to ascertain how people will use technology in the future. The Redmond, Washington-based company recently delved into the 3D space by acquiring Swedish company Simplygon to further accelerate its “3D For Everyone” strategy that it initially introduced with Windows 10 Creators Update.It made an investment in AI with its purchase of Toronto-based Maluuba, a language comprehension startup that developed a system that comprehends at levels approaching human intelligence. The company’s venture arm, Microsoft Ventures, recently agreed to back Illusive Networks, a cybersecurity firm that uses a deceptive framework to identify and trap hackers. Starting from the proposition that some hackers will find their way through traditional firewalls and other security obstacles, Illusive uses virtual and augmented reality technology to create a decoy version of a company’s network to trap hackers.And Microsoft announced that in 2017 and 2018 it would be opening three new locations of Microsoft Garage, an internal group of employees dedicated to creating innovative software. The Garage began with a few hundred dedicated employees in 2013 and counts thousands among its ranks today. is among the vanguard of technology companies that lives in the space most frequented by young, tech-savvy users: gaming and mobile devices. It set the standard for computer gaming in 1999 with the release of its Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It is also a leading pioneer in Artificial Intelligence, making it one of the most forward-thinking companies in the computer space today. It released its DGX-1 Deep Learning System, a piece of hardware known as a “supercomputer in a box” that aims to make AI data more accessible.It is the latest in the company’s investment in AI and the company’s philosophy is that AI is for everyone.

"roadcom () is set to report third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday.The semiconductor giant, which also has a leading position wired infrastructure and wireless communication markets, has seen its stock rise near all-time highs, delivering year-to-date returns of 45%, besting not only the 9% rise in the S&P 500 Index, but also doubling the 20% rise in the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF ().Broadcom’s outperformance in the chip sector, compared to peers such as Analog Devices (), Cavium (), Texas Instruments (), and Xilinx (), continues to be driven by its extensive product portfolio, containing assets that serve multiple applications within four primary end markets, including enterprise storage and industrials which — in addition to its wired and wireless businesses — are all growing at double-digit rates.As such, analysts expects Broadcom not only to report year-over-year increases in both revenue and profits, but also to issue strong guidance for the just-begun quarter. For the quarter that ended July, Wall Street expects the Singapore-based company to deliver $4.03 per share on revenue of $4.46 billion, translating to year-over-year increases of 39% and 17.2%, respectively.For the full year, ending October, earnings are projected to rise 37.7% year over year to $15.77 per share, while full-year revenue of $17.6 billion would mark a 32.4% increase year over year. As breathtaking as the top and bottom-line expectation might appear, they may yet underestimate what Broadcom is able to do.In the second quarter the company delivered EPS of $3.69, which was enough to beat the highest Street profit estimate by 19 cents and earning its twelfth straight earnings beat. Meanwhile, second quarter revenue of $4.2 billion grew 18% year over year, topping estimates by $100 million, logging its sixth consecutive top-line beat, driven by a 45% revenue surge in the wireless business. These events have, understandably, ratcheted up expectations.On Tuesday John Vinh, analysts at KeyBanc, who has $280 price target on AVGO stock, reiterated his Overweight rating, citing Apple's () upcoming iPhone launch. In a note to investors, Vinh wrote that Broadcom is ""one of the best-positioned suppliers to benefit” from the new iPhone, which is expected to be unveiled next month.Broadcom’s relationship with Apple, to which it provides wireless components for the iPhones, is seen as a potential near-term catalyst for the rest of the year an beyond. The device is said to support wireless charging technology from Broadcom, among other components that are estimated at a $500 million to $600 million business win for Broadcom.With the stock already trading at all-time highs, it seems the market has already priced in these potential catalysts. But given Broadcom’s strong track record of execution, buying high with the expectation to sell even higher remains a good strategy.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Broadcom (AVGO) 3rd Quarter Earnings: What to Expect@2017-08-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/broadcom-avgo-3rd-quarter-earnings-what-expect-2017-08-24

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $64.78, changing hands for $65.18/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $45.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $78.00. The standard deviation is $8.34.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $64.78/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $64.78 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

"he semiconductor industry is made up of 15 sub-sectors (including 4 for semiconductor equipment) within the Technology sector, which is one of the 16 broad Zacks-categorized sectors.Similar to the Technology sector, Zacks also breaks down each of the other sectors into groups such that there are a total of 264 sub-sectors or industries. These ""X"" industries are then grouped in two: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (Click here to know more:  )Therefore the Zacks Industry Rank is a good indicator of investment opportunities within an industry at any given time. Moreover, because stocks in the same X industry have certain common positive or negative factors affecting them, it has been observed that there is some positive correlation between them.The X industries pertaining to semiconductor stocks have been tabulated below. The list clearly displays the kind of industries likely to have more winners. The last column enlists our picks, which are basically Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Rank #2 (Buy) stocks within the top 132 X industries.One of the main factors driving the Zacks Rank for individual stocks is earnings results. Therefore, it makes sense to take a look at how those have been in the last-reported quarter.From the latest  , we see that 80.3% of technology stocks have reported with both top and bottom line results beating the S&P 500. Overall, technology stocks' earnings were up 17.9% from the year-ago quarter on 9.2% growth. This compares with earnings and revenue growth of 10.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Also, 83.7% of technology stocks beat earnings estimates compared to 74.3% for the S&P 500. A like percentage of technology companies also beat revenue expectations with the S&P 500 averaging much lower at 68.0%.This section can be divided into the current and emerging drivers. But before getting into that, it's important to understand the backdrop. This includes a shrinking traditional market (mainly PCs) that still consumes the bulk of chips as well as several emerging categories that have extremely strong growth potential. Which means that while the industry as a whole may appear sluggish, there are some solid opportunities.As far as current drivers are concerned, the most significant are cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence that are increasing demand for  exponentially. Intel (INTC) and NVIDIA (NVDA) are the strongest positioned here, with Intel's strength mainly on the enterprise side and NVIDIA's on the HPC side. Intel is working to challenge NVIDIA, but that will take time.HPC is where a lot of the innovation is going on and NVIDIA continues to pick up share of spending because of its lead in machine learning. Intel has plans to get in the game with the technology it acquired through Nervana Systems and Altera. Both Intel and NVIDIA are working on hybrid solutions because GPUs do a better job of processing the huge amounts of data to train a neural network while CPUs do a better job of applying that data to a given situation.Xilinx (XLNX) is another important player working with FPGAs on top of ARM-based chips. With a $16 billion artificial intelligence market (according to MarketsandMarkets) by 2020 waiting to be tapped, it's no wonder that players are going all out to grab their share.Some disruption is afoot in the enterprise segment as well because of the work done by the Open Compute Project (OCP) that Facebook (FB) founded and continues to feed. The social networking company generates huge volumes of data that it needs to store, manage and process as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible.Others with similar interest like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL), and differing interest like Intel, HP, Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper are also part of the project. Facebook designs hardware that is then optimized by the OCP so it becomes something members can standardize on. So far, so good. But if the OCP is able to design chips that perform better or comparably with Intel chips, the chip maker's cloud business can be hurt. Intel being part of the effort implies that it is working to get its technology in as part of the standard.Another challenge for traditional semiconductor players includesGoogle, which is working with IBM's (IBM) new chip designs. It is reportedly the only top chip buyer that doesn't sell servers but instead builds them for internal use. Therefore, Google's decisions are significant in the chip consumption context.Google has done two things in the past that could be viewed as second-sourcing or maybe creating leverage against Intel to pressure it into lowering prices. The company has declared that everything it now does also supports IBM's Power systems and it is also in talks with Qualcomm (QCOM) that could result in its using some of its ARM-based server chips.Amazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure, followed by Microsoft, IBM and Google. This is another chip-hungry segment with long-term demand for the devices. Since infrastructure providers need a huge number of chips, each has its own development efforts. Amazon for instance has acquired and hired people for the purpose; Google has announced that it is testing IBM and ARM technology while Microsoft is collaborating with Qualcomm to test ARM designs.Cost per watt, reliability and low-latency are factors determining purchases and it's possible that all these efforts will eventually beat Intel. It's only when (or if) these players take their consumption in house will there be pressure on semiconductor players. In that case, Intel the incumbent would be the worst affected.Another important segment for semiconductor companies that is relatively low-key is  . Since semiconductors facilitate increased automation on the factory floor, they are increasingly used to drive efficiency and lower cost. Reportedly, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) expects the industrial semiconductor market to grow at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 9.7% between 2014 and 2019. IHS Markit says that the market grew 3.8% in 2016 to $43.5 billion driven by commercial and military avionics, digital signage, network video surveillance, HVAC, smart meters, PV inverters, LED lighting and various medical electronics.The U.S. is the biggest spender but improving economic conditions in Europe, China, India and Brazil also drove demand. A Global Industry Analysts (GIA) report says that the U.S. is the largest market for industrial semiconductors although the Asia/Pacific is the fastest growing on account of its being a manufacturing hub. The overall market is expected to be worth $60 billion by 2022.One of the fastest-growing emerging markets for semiconductor devices is  , as the consumption of electronic components for safety, infotainment, navigation and fuel efficiency continues to increase. A recent report from MarketsandMarkets says that the automotive semiconductor market will grow at a CAGR of 5.8% from 2016 through 2022.Power components like MOSFET and IGBT devices are some of the fastest growing because of the increased electrification of vehicles. The growing middle class in several Asian markets like China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia is greatly increasing the demand for passenger cars, thus accounting for most of the semiconductor shipments into the automotive market.Infineon, STMicroelectronics, Renesas (which acquired Intersil), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI) and Cypress are important players. Qualcomm, after its acquisition of NXP Semiconductor, which itself acquired Freescale Semiconductor, has become a major player in automotive semiconductors.The automotive market has an emerging adjacent market in the form of autonomous/self-driving cars that will consume a huge number of semiconductors, particularly sensors, processors and other technology enabling the vehicles. builds have been necessitated by increasing data volumes and connectivity issues (network congestion, power reliability, privacy and security) in wireless networks. These builds will require increased investment in semiconductors, thus driving sales. New materials (a compound of two or more) are being used in this segment with Galium Nitride gaining share of RF high-power semiconductors, according to ABI Research.According to Strategy Analytics, the greatest driver of these compound semiconductors is the convergence of voice, video and data networks that is leading to the explosive growth of data traffic across wireless devices, within fixed and wireless networks, in driver assistance systems, in network-centric battlefield philosophies, solid-state lighting and high-power electronics. The firm expects compound semiconductor revenue to grow at a 13% compounded average annual growth rate (CAAGR) to double revenue to $11 billion by 2020.The  still consumes a large number of chips but its importance as a driver continues to decline. That's because the market itself is shrinking (Gartner estimates that it declined 4.3% in the second quarter while IDC estimates that it declined 3.3%). IDC believes that Japan grew for the second straight quarter with LatAm and the U.S. outperforming its expectations. Gartner doesn't include chromebooks in its calculations, but said that they were moderately impacting the PC market posting 38% growth in 2016 compared to a 6% decline in PCs.Consumers are hesitant to spend on upgrades given that they already have many more devices than they need (developed markets) and because Internet and many other conveniences of computers are now easily available on smartphones and tablets (emerging markets). But gaming enthusiasts and enterprises require stronger and faster machines, so they are the major drivers.In either case, it's very clear that the steady growth seen in years past is history. IDC, for one, expects the PC market to shrink 2.1% in 2017. So semiconductor players with PC market exposure can at best profit from market share gains, BYOD exposure and increased exposure to the top PC vendors, which are HP, Lenovo, Dell, Apple and Asus according to both IDC and Gartner.Apple makes its own PCs, software and also a lot of its own processors, relying largely on Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung for its other semiconductor requirements. Microsoft makes software and limited quantities of hardware, relying largely on third-party device makers for chips, PCs and mobile devices. It's also a major player in the cloud, which makes it an important ally for semiconductor companies like Intel, Qualcomm or NVIDIA. Alphabet's chromebooks on the other hand are made by a number of hardware makers that use either Intel or ARM technology.Traditionally, the  market included smartphones, tablets and electronic gadgets like LCD TVs and Blu-ray players. But that is changing as we speak with the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), formerly called Consumer Electronics Association (""CEA"") estimating that U.S. consumer technology retail sales will be driven by IoT this year to touch $321 billion (estimate six months earlier was $286.6 billion).Moreover, these traditional segments are expected to decline this year with their contribution dropping to less than 50% of total sales for the first time next year.  are mature categories with shipments expected to grow a respective 3%, -5% and -1%. Laptops will grow 2%.Of the emerging technology categories,  will grow 59%;  will grow 9% (includes fitness activity trackers, other health and fitness devices, hearables, over-the-counter hearing devices and smartwatches);  encompassing products like thermostats, smart smoke and CO2 detectors, IP/Wi-Fi cameras, smart locks, smart home systems, and smart switches, dimmers and outlets, will grow 50%; drones will grow 40%, VR 79% and voice-activated digital assistants like Amazon's Echo 53%.Most of the emerging technology categories fall in the group more commonly referred to as  . A recent McKinsey report says that the installed base of IoT devices was in the range of 7-10 billion at 2015-end and is expected to increase by about 15-20% annually over the next few years to 26-30 billion units by 2020.IC Insights estimates that IoT semiconductor sales will increase 16.2% in 2017 to $21.3 billion and will grow at a CAGR of 14.9% from 2015 to 2020. For the period, semiconductor revenue growth in smart cities of 8.9%, wearables 17.1%, industrial Internet 24.1%, connected homes 21.3% and connected vehicles 32.9%.However, despite the strong revenue prospects, this is still a nascent market with several challenges to its continued growth. These would be security/privacy because of the huge amount of data generated and collected, still-limited availability of consistent standards enabling interoperability, relatively low ROI for chipmakers necessitating the integration of additional technology or the final product by the chipmaker, and the possibility of a growing number of niche products.Companies are doubling down on these challenges. For instance, NXP is part of the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmarking Consortium (EEMBC) to identify embedded security gaps and set guidelines for IoT manufacturers to make more secure devices.Also, both Intel and ARM (now acquired by Softbank) have increased focus on security. Intel is working on building chip-level security while also facilitating security in the cloud through the McAfee Data Exchange Layer. ARM will likely build some security features into its designs.On the standardization front, companies like Intel, IBM, Cisco, GE and AT&T have formed the Industrial Internet Consortium to develop common standards. The process could take time but once available, the standards could generate higher-margin revenue for semiconductor players. There will, however, be increased scrutiny on privacy considerations.The  estimates that semiconductor sales in 2016 were up 1.1% from 2015 levels (versus expectations of a 0.1% increase. Logic, memory and micro-ICs were the top three segments, sensors and actuators was the fastest growing segment (up 22.7%), NAND Flash (up 11.0%), DSP (12.5%), diodes 8.7%, small signal transistors 7.3% and analog 5.8%. regionally, China was strongest (up 9.2%) followed by Japan (up 3.8%), while Asia Pacific/All Other dropped 1.7%, Europe dropped 4.5% and the Americas were down 4.7%. WSTS data projects 2017 growth of 6.5% (previous 3.3%) driven by sensors, analog and memory. It will be followed by 2.3% growth in 2018.IC Insights has doubled its 2017 growth forecast to 11% (previous 5%) because of significant upward revisions in DRAM (up 39%) and NAND (up 25%) sales. The increase will be driven by higher prices (37% for DRAM and 22% for NAND).Gartner estimates that semiconductor capital spending will rise 10.2% in 2017 due to strong manufacturing demand in memory and leading-edge logic. WFE and packaging will grow 17.9% with other semiconductor capital spending growing 1.8%.The Semiconductor Industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress. Developments in the industry determine the way we work, transport ourselves, communicate, entertain ourselves, defend ourselves and respond to our environment.The emergence of categories like health monitoring devices and home automation gadgets, and the increased automation on factory floors, automobiles and elsewhere have added a new dimension to the industry. Environmental concerns and the need for judicious use of resources have also opened upopportunities in the form of chipsreducing power consumption, reducing heat dissipation, capturing solar energy, creating more efficient lighting solutions and so forth.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

"Chicago, IL - August 18, 2017 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry: Semiconductors, including Intel (NASDAQ:  -  ), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:  -  ), Xilinx (NASDAQ:  -  ) and Facebook (NASDAQ:  -  ).Industry: SemiconductorsLink: The semiconductor industry is made up of 15 sub-sectors (including 4 for semiconductor equipment) within the Technology sector, which is one of the 16 broad Zacks-categorized sectors.Similar to the Technology sector, Zacks also breaks down each of the other sectors into groups such that there are a total of 264 sub-sectors or industries. These ""X"" industries are then grouped in two: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (Click here to know more:  )Therefore the Zacks Industry Rank is a good indicator of investment opportunities within an industry at any given time. Moreover, because stocks in the same X industry have certain common positive or negative factors affecting them, it has been observed that there is some positive correlation between them.The X industries pertaining to semiconductor stocks have been tabulated below. The list clearly displays the kind of industries likely to have more winners. The last column enlists our picks, which are basically Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Rank #2 (Buy) stocks within the top 132 X industries.One of the main factors driving the Zacks Rank for individual stocks is earnings results. Therefore, it makes sense to take a look at how those have been in the last-reported quarter.From the latest  , we see that 80.3% of technology stocks have reported with both top and bottom line results beating the S&P 500. Overall, technology stocks' earnings were up 17.9% from the year-ago quarter on 9.2% growth. This compares with earnings and revenue growth of 10.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Also, 83.7% of technology stocks beat earnings estimates compared to 74.3% for the S&P 500. A like percentage of technology companies also beat revenue expectations with the S&P 500 averaging much lower at 68.0%.This section can be divided into the current and emerging drivers. But before getting into that, it's important to understand the backdrop. This includes a shrinking traditional market (mainly PCs) that still consumes the bulk of chips as well as several emerging categories that have extremely strong growth potential. Which means that while the industry as a whole may appear sluggish, there are some solid opportunities.As far as current drivers are concerned, the most significant are cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence that are increasing demand for  exponentially. Intel (NASDAQ:  -  ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:  -  ) are the strongest positioned here, with Intel's strength mainly on the enterprise side and NVIDIA's on the HPC side. Intel is working to challenge NVIDIA, but that will take time.HPC is where a lot of the innovation is going on and NVIDIA continues to pick up share of spending because of its lead in machine learning. Intel has plans to get in the game with the technology it acquired through Nervana Systems and Altera. Both Intel and NVIDIA are working on hybrid solutions because GPUs do a better job of processing the huge amounts of data to train a neural network while CPUs do a better job of applying that data to a given situation.Xilinx (NASDAQ:  -  ) is another important player working with FPGAs on top of ARM-based chips. With a $16 billion artificial intelligence market (according to MarketsandMarkets) by 2020 waiting to be tapped, it's no wonder that players are going all out to grab their share.Some disruption is afoot in the enterprise segment as well because of the work done by the Open Compute Project (OCP) that Facebook (NASDAQ:  -  ) founded and continues to feed. The social networking company generates huge volumes of data that it needs to store, manage and process as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible.Within the Zacks Industry classification, health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 265 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank is #177 (bottom 34%). The ranking is available on the  .Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public. Yet today's 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buys"" were generated by the stock-picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015. Its average gain has been a stellar +26% per year.

 is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%. Notably, Xilinx outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.89%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Keeping its earnings streak alive for the 12th successive quarter, Xilinx reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Further, both the top line and bottom line increased year over year.Rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's product launches are likely to further aid revenues.We are also encouraged by Xilinx's endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also increase investors' confidence and loyalty.However, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, could adversely affect Xilinx's near-term results. Competition from the likes of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  is another headwind. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinxis likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.

eprogrammable microchip giant  (NASDAQ: XLNX) reported results last week, covering the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The company beat Wall Street's earnings estimates for the reported period, but Xilinx's share price has been sliding 4%  since the report. Why are investors giving Xilinx shares the cold shoulder?Image source: Xilinx.In the first quarter, Xilinx reported  earnings of $0.63 per diluted share, up from $0.61 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues increased by 7%, to land at $615 million. Analysts had been expecting earnings of $0.60 per share on sales of $616 million.The company doesn't report any non-GAAP earnings figures, so this is an apples-to-apples comparison. It was also the first time Xilinx stopped short of the Street's quarterly revenue estimates since the second quarter of 2016, reported in October 2015.But that would be a mighty nitpicky explanation for the market's indifferent-to-negative reaction. Let's look at Xilinx's guidance for the third quarter, too.In the third quarter, Xilinx's management expects sales of approximately $620 million and bottom-line earnings near $0.62 per diluted share. That compares to second-quarter Street estimates of $616 million and $0.63 per share at the time of the report. The guidance was roughly in line with analyst estimates, predicting 7% year-over-year sales growth and 3% higher earnings.Earnings guidance didn't match the top-line projection because Xilinx's operating expenses will be unusually high in the second quarter. The company is busy working up a new generation of programmable chips, and most of the increase in Xilinx's operating costs will fall in the research and development (R&D) department.After analyzing the history of Xilinx's guidance and results, I've found that management tends to set an achievable bar for each quarter. In the last four reports, the company exceeded the midpoint of earnings guidance three times and hit the exact center once. The same goes for revenue guidance. For what it's worth, analysts tend to eventually adjust their revenue expectations to match management's forecasts -- but earnings targets often end up below the midpoint of Xilinx's guidance ranges.It's fair to say that Xilinx knows how to set up appropriate financial targets. The company rarely misses its own forecasts, and the Street is listening to these accurate-to-modest projections.Image source: .Image source:  .We have a solid earnings surprise and revenues $1 million below Street projections, and both numbers were at least in line with management's own projections. Next-quarter earnings are tapping the growth brakes due to R&D investments that will build the company's future, instead.Investors are latching on to a combination of this quarter's unexciting revenues and next quarter's high operating expenses, and the reaction is to shrug and walk away. Honestly, I think that's a mistake.Xilinx is focusing on key growth markets like  , automotive-computing solutions, and application-specific computing acceleration. In the first quarter, for example, both  and  placed large orders for application accelerators to be used in their cloud-computing services.Moreover, programmable chips like Xilinx's standard-issue bread and butter products happen to be great at the type of number crunching that's needed in  , so the company would benefit if new-age currencies, like bitcoin and Ethereum, were to break into mainstream use.So the stock slides on a temporary earnings slowdown, paving the way for greater achievements in 2018 and beyond. You might call it a correction, because Xilinx shares trade at well-deserved P/E (price to earnings) and cash flow ratios that are above average in the semiconductor industry. You could also call it a buy-in opportunity, or at least an open invitation to learn more about this interesting company and its market-beating stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 63 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by three cents. The figure increased 2.7% from the year-ago quarter and 9.6% from the previous quarter.The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher revenues, while the sequential increase benefited from lower operating expenses despite modest top-line growth.Xilinx reported revenues of approximately $615.4 million, up 7% year over year and 1% quarter over quarter. Revenues were in line with the mid point of the company's guided revenue range of $600-$630 million. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $616 million.Management noted that Xilinx's revenues have grown for the seventh consecutive quarter reflecting product strength. The growth was primarily driven by robust performance of the company's 16nm, 20nm, and 28nm products. Management also noted that the expanded partnership with Avnet  is benefiting top-line growth. | On the basis of End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (41% of total revenue) declined 1% year over year, but increased 1% sequentially. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (42% of total revenue) increased 17% on a year-over-year basis but remained flat on a sequential basis. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (17% of total revenue) increased 6% year over year and 3% sequentially.Product wise, Advanced products revenues increased a whopping 33% year over year and 8% sequentially. We note that the segment's contribution to total revenue was 52%, a significant increase from 42% in the year-ago quarter and 49% in the previous quarter.The 28-nm portfolio increased sequentially due to strong demand from ISM, TME, broadcast and consumer market. The 20-nm sales also significantly increased in the quarter, driven by robust demand in wireless, primarily for pre-5G deployments.However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the topmost performer in the quarter. The company shipped 22 unique products to more than 530 discrete customers across all end markets.As expected, revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-ago quarter and 6% sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe increased 16%, 9% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from North America declined 6%.Sequentially, North America was weak, declining 7%. This was fully offset by robust growth from Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe, which increased 5%, 12% and 1%, respectively.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all programmable devices producer is helping it to gain market share. The company's expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is aiding it against intense competition from the likes of Intel  . Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered strong top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx stated that it has started sampling of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product helps in reducing power consumption (50% to 75%) and footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of Amazon's  FPGA-as-a-Service (the cloud service is supported by Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGAs) that targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. Xilinx believes that Amazon's deployment of SDAccel and SDSoC products will boost its competitive position against other SoC providers.Gross margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) year over year to 68.8% and was within the company's guided range of 68-70%. Sequentially, gross margin contracted 70 bps.Operating expenses increased 10.5% year over year but declined 2.7% to $242.3 million. The figure was almost $3 million higher than the company's guidance. This was because Xilinx accelerated some 16-nm tape-out expenses to extend its technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense.Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 39.4%, reflecting a 130 bps year-over-year increase. But sequentially, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, fell 150 bps.As a result, operating income declined 3.5% year over year but increased 3.7% quarter over quarter to $181 million. Additionally, operating margin contracted 320 bps due to lower gross margin base as well as higher operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues. Sequentially, operating margin expanded 80 bps.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.65 billion compared with $3.32 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.74 billion up from $995.2 million at the end of the previous quarter.During the quarter, Xilinx raised $750 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 2.95% with a seven-year term.Xilinx generated cash of $191 million from operations and incurred $10 million as capital expenditure. The company paid $82 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $67 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx expects revenues in a range $605-$635 million. (mid-point $620 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance range of $620 million is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.7 million.Management continues to expect growth in Advanced Products segment. Xilings expects the communications end-market to decline primarily due to weakness in wireless. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive are expected to increase.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $253 million, higher than expected due to increasing research & development (R&D) expenses related to tape-outs. Tax rate is projected between 10% and 14%.The company remains focused on achieving the fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. Xilinx also expects to deliver more than 30% of operating margin exiting this fiscal year.We believe that rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes is positive for the company. Moreover, favorable product mix (higher Industrial, lower wireless) will help in gross margin expansion in the current quarter.Xilinx's expanding software defined programming portfolio along with hardware solutions to accelerate machine learning is expected to drive user base. The company has significant growth opportunities in Data center, 5G deployment, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial IoT and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) applications over the long haul.However, growth from wireless is expected to remain volatile until 2020, which is a concern. Increasing operating expenses related to tape-outs will weigh on profitability in the near term.Moreover, management's pessimistic view over business conditions in India and China, two of its fastest growing markets, poses strong headwinds.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The figure increased 2.7% from the year-ago quarter and 9.6% from the previous quarter.The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher revenues, while the sequential increase benefited from lower operating expenses despite modest top-line growth.Xilinx reported revenues of approximately $615.4 million, up 7% year over year and 1% quarter over quarter. Revenues were in line with the mid point of the company's guided revenue range of $600-$630 million. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $616 million.Management noted that Xilinx's revenues have grown for the seventh consecutive quarter reflecting product strength. The growth was primarily driven by robust performance of the company's 16nm, 20nm, and 28nm products. Management also noted that the expanded partnership with Avnet  is benefiting top-line growth. | On the basis of End Market, Communications & Data Center segment revenues (41% of total revenue) declined 1% year over year, but increased 1% sequentially. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment revenues (42% of total revenue) increased 17% on a year-over-year basis but remained flat on a sequential basis. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues (17% of total revenue) increased 6% year over year and 3% sequentially.Product wise, Advanced products revenues increased a whopping 33% year over year and 8% sequentially. We note that the segment's contribution to total revenue was 52%, a significant increase from 42% in the year-ago quarter and 49% in the previous quarter.The 28-nm portfolio increased sequentially due to strong demand from ISM, TME, broadcast and consumer market. The 20-nm sales also significantly increased in the quarter, driven by robust demand in wireless, primarily for pre-5G deployments.However, Xilinx noted that the 16-nm was the topmost performer in the quarter. The company shipped 22 unique products to more than 530 discrete customers across all end markets.As expected, revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-ago quarter and 6% sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe increased 16%, 9% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from North America declined 6%.Sequentially, North America was weak, declining 7%. This was fully offset by robust growth from Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe, which increased 5%, 12% and 1%, respectively.Xilinx's ongoing transition from a FPGA provider to an all programmable devices producer is helping it to gain market share. The company's expanding product portfolio, which includes the Zynq RFSoC platform, is aiding it against intense competition from the likes of Intel  . Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28-nm and 16-nm node, delivered strong top-line growth in the quarter.Xilinx stated that it has started sampling of the 16-nm RFSoC Silicon In-house family of product, which offers a superior architectural solution to 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. The product helps in reducing power consumption (50% to 75%) and footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.Management is also optimistic over the demand of Amazon's  FPGA-as-a-Service (the cloud service is supported by Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGAs) that targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. Xilinx believes that Amazon's deployment of SDAccel and SDSoC products will boost its competitive position against other SoC providers.Gross margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) year over year to 68.8% and was within the company's guided range of 68-70%. Sequentially, gross margin contracted 70 bps.Operating expenses increased 10.5% year over year but declined 2.7% to $242.3 million. The figure was almost $3 million higher than the company's guidance. This was because Xilinx accelerated some 16-nm tape-out expenses to extend its technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense.Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 39.4%, reflecting a 130 bps year-over-year increase. But sequentially, operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, fell 150 bps.As a result, operating income declined 3.5% year over year but increased 3.7% quarter over quarter to $181 million. Additionally, operating margin contracted 320 bps due to lower gross margin base as well as higher operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues. Sequentially, operating margin expanded 80 bps.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.65 billion compared with $3.32 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $1.74 billion up from $995.2 million at the end of the previous quarter.During the quarter, Xilinx raised $750 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 2.95% with a seven-year term.Xilinx generated cash of $191 million from operations and incurred $10 million as capital expenditure. The company paid $82 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $67 million.For second-quarter fiscal 2018, Xilinx expects revenues in a range $605-$635 million. (mid-point $620 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance range of $620 million is currently higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.7 million.Management continues to expect growth in Advanced Products segment. Xilings expects the communications end-market to decline primarily due to weakness in wireless. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive are expected to increase.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 69% and 71%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $253 million, higher than expected due to increasing research & development (R&D) expenses related to tape-outs. Tax rate is projected between 10% and 14%.The company remains focused on achieving the fiscal 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. Xilinx also expects to deliver more than 30% of operating margin exiting this fiscal year.We believe that rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes is positive for the company. Moreover, favorable product mix (higher Industrial, lower wireless) will help in gross margin expansion in the current quarter.Xilinx's expanding software defined programming portfolio along with hardware solutions to accelerate machine learning is expected to drive user base. The company has significant growth opportunities in Data center, 5G deployment, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial IoT and Advanced Driver Assisted Systems (ADAS) applications over the long haul.However, growth from wireless is expected to remain volatile until 2020, which is a concern. Increasing operating expenses related to tape-outs will weigh on profitability in the near term.Moreover, management's pessimistic view over business conditions in India and China, two of its fastest growing markets, poses strong headwinds.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months. Yesterday's science-fiction is becoming today's reality. Despite all the innovation, there is a single component no tech company can survive without.

Semiconductor ETFs had a great 2016, having returned in the range of 35-46%. Areas like autonomous cars, 3D printers, fitness devices and IoT fueled growth in the sector, offsetting otherwise-saturating businesses like PCs and smartphones.

In the last six months (as of August 18, 2017), semiconductor ETFs kept pace with the soaring broader technology sector.Let's find out which factors may drive the semiconductor rally ahead.Bitcoin is on a tear this year. The digital currency has now more than quadrupled in value from around $997 at the start of the year. Bitcoins are 'mined' by using a greater amount of computer processing power. Creation and transactions in bitcoin are controlled through cryptography to keep transactions secure.Like bitcoin, Ether or etherum is also quite popular this year. Now, mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors. A  (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is designed explicitly for mining bitcoin.This where semiconductor companies can gain traction. As per  , there was a 10-fold rise from April to June in the Ethereum market which helped shares of  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) substantially. added that Nvidia is better placed than its competitors to cash in on the cryptocurrency rally.Though shipment of smartphones has cooled down lately, the continued shift toward 4G LTE in high-end smartphones has given a boost to wafer demand for advanced process technologies, as per research agency  .Plus, the rapid deployment of fingerprint sensors and active-matrix dynamic light-emitting diodes (AMOLEDs) by Chinese smartphones should also give the space a boost, as per several research agencies including Gartner. Recently, the agency indicated that consumer applications will likely make up for  of the overall IoT applications in 2017.In any case, semiconductor is the value-centric traditional tech area that is likely to have an upper hand in an edgy investing environment. Moreover, the semiconductor space is consolidating rapidly with a number of deals announced lately.Investors should note that there was a gathering ofshort sellers in the semiconductor sector only to acknowledge defeat. As per an article published on  , out of the 10 biggest semiconductor shorts in the U.S. market only two,  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ), were in favor of short sellers.

hare price of  rallied to a new 52-week high of $35.29, eventually closing a tad bit lower at $34.93 on May 26. This represents a strong year-to-date return of approximately 38.5% compared with the Zack's  industry's gain of 18% over the same period.The share price momentum can be attributed to the company's expanding product portfolio and customer base. These drove first-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Including stock-based compensation, the company reported earnings of 25 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.We note that Cadence has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.82%.Moreover, revenues of almost $477 million increased 6.5% year over year and easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $473 million and was within management's guided range of $470-$480 million.Currently, Cadence has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, the stock has a market capital of $9.7 billion.As evident from the first-quarter results, Cadence is benefiting from improving penetration of its newly launched products like Xcelium and Protium S1 as well as strong adoption of Palladium Z1 and Pegasus Verification solution. During the quarter, the company won a number of customers including Xilinx  , Mellanox  and Texas Instruments.We note that Cadence's digital, signoff and custom/analog tools are now enabled on Samsung Electronics' 7LPP and 8LPP process technologies. Moreover, recent certification of its 28nm FDS reference flow by Samsung is also a positive, as it will help Cadence to win new customers.Further, the expansion of the JasperGold platform and extension of partnership with MathWorks that combines Virtuoso Analog Design Environment (ADE) Product Suite and MATLAB are growth drivers.We believe that Cadence's expanding product portfolio will boost its competitive position going forward. Its strong product portfolio also presents growth opportunities as semiconductor business conditions stabilize in 2017.Management noted that as part of the System Design Enablement (SDE) strategy, Cadence continues to pursue opportunities in higher growth areas like automotive, cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and aerospace & defense, which will eventually drive overall results. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has remained steady at 96 cents over the last 30 days. The estimate for fiscal 2018 has also been steady at $1.03 over the same time frame.ACI Worldwide  with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is a stock worth considering in the same sector.

nvestors in  need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the June 2 nd , 2017 $66.71 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an  strategy.Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Xilinx shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Xilinx is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Semiconductors - Programmable Logic industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while no analyst has revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 57 cents per share to 60 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Xilinx right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

"The stock market has spent much of the early summer months ""melting higher"" as investors have been hesitant to push their cash into a market that refuses to budge from all-time highs. Of course, we know there are always quality stocks to buy out there, regardless of what the market is doing. Source: ShutterstockBreakout stocks, comeback stocks, you name it - the market always provides ways to pad our accounts with fast profits.What's on our radar right now? The recent pullback in the market, which has a large number of tech stocks sitting pretty according to a number of things - our scoring models, longer-term technicals and, naturally, fundamentals. Specifically, we've recently identified a list of about 15 stocks that have seen short-term weakness, but now appear ready to shift back into breakout mode.Today, we want to focus on the seven best stocks of the bunch.Here's a look at seven stocks, all clustered in the tech sector, to buy for some early summer rally returns. 11%When you think of hot semiconductor companies, you think of  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) or  (NASDAQ:  ). (NASDAQ:  ) hasn't provided the same caliber of returns over the past year, but it's still up by more than 45% in 52 weeks to easily outpace every major market index.Xilinx's last earnings report helped trigger a breakout above $64. Now, traders are looking at the stock as another bullish prospect with earnings just about a month down the road.XLNX shares have been stuck in a range between $64 and $68, which has been great for the chart watchers as they have been able to collect a lot of profits in this well-defined range. I expect this to change.As July's earnings slowly begin to approach, we're going to see more participation in the technical bounce from $64. That added participation will help XLNX break through $68 this time around and drive even more of a breakout.Our models like Xilinx shares to cross $73 before the company's next announcement. 20% (NYSE:  ) has been a market laggard for most of the year, down 4% versus an S&P 500 that has gained more than 8% year-to-date. On a slightly longer 12-month basis, IBM shares are only up 2% compared to the S&P 500's returns of 17%.Needless to say, IBM stock hasn't been a winner.Yet.IBM shares just spent the past month trading at a consolidation level of $150. If you look at historical charts, you'll find that this is actually a key level for IBM, and should serve as a long-term bottom.A rally won't be without its challenges. A break below $150 will bring about a new round of selling pressure. Meanwhile, IBM's 50-day moving average - just overhead at $156 - is declining and preparing to apply its own downward force.However, a break above this mark will take IBM stock to a challenge at their 20-month trendline, and a break above that will put shares back into a bull market for the first time in three months.That'll attract the long-term buyers and really get IBM into gear. We see prices as high as $180 in IBM's future. 12% (NASDAQ:  ) shares have suffered following the company's most recent earnings report, which failed to impress. However, political uncertainty has also affected industrial companies such as Fastenal, whose shares are trading 4% lower for the year and flat for the past 12 months.Despite this, our models are forecasting a technical breakout for FAST shares over the next few weeks that have the potential to change the stock's direction into a breakout.The stock is currently fighting its 50-day moving average - in my opinion, the most important trendline for any stock. A break above this trendline, currently at $44.81, will immediately put the shares in position to challenge their 200-day moving average at $45.43.Clearing these two technical hurdles in a short period of time will change the trajectory of Fastenal's price trend. Our models indicate a price target of $50. 11%Streaming giant  (NASDAQ:  ) has suffered a 10% decline of late. However, this massive pullback has set up a perfect buying opportunity for nimble chart watchers.See, the 10% correction took NFLX stock to an almost perfect test of the 100-day moving average. Currently, this trendline is sitting at $148 - just below today's lows. A hold of this trendline will maintain an intermediate-term bullish outlook.That decline has also taken Netflix shares to an oversold reading for the first time since April.There's a group of technical traders that are always looking for the opportunity to get into Netflix on a pullback. The recent drop has put the ball on the tee, and our models suggest these traders will hit it out of the park - good for a breakout to $170. 12%Calling for a breakout in  (NYSE:  ) might seem silly or cliche, depending on your viewpoint. After all, that's  Alibaba has been doing of late.Still, our models indicate that BABA stock will remain a leader throughout the rest of 2017.The opportunity for Alibaba at this point is the ""buy the dip"" breakout. Shares have seen a crowd of traders sell the news after their earnings release a few weeks ago. The stock dipped from about $148 to a base at $135 where it started its most recent rally.The technical crowd is grabbing these shares on this dip, and at strong volume no less. In other words, this rally will set a course for prices  recent highs.For now, our model is suggesting prices between $150-$155, which moves Alibaba back into new high territory. 12% (NASDAQ:  )  is one of those companies that has been putting up numbers that traders have just been ignoring. But that's an opportunity for those of us willing to front-run the moment everyone else figures out they should own this stock.Right now, Garmin shares are matching the market's performance as they trade above 8% higher year-to-date, but the stock has been stuck in a range that looks ready to release and allow shares to rally significantly.We just watched the stock get support from the 50-day again, and shares are now heading toward $53 again on rising volume. This indicates that the crowd is starting to take note of the potential breakout.Our model loves the fact that 0% of the analysts covering the stock have it ranked a buy, which means there is room for upgrades to drive a breakout. In addition, there are still some shorts that are trying to get out of the shares, which helps fuel the rally.A break above $53 is going to target a breakout above $55, likely to the $57-$58 level, as Garmin sill then be trading in a technical bull market! 11%Last is  (NASDAQ:  ), which you'll need to keep an eye on very soon, as it's set to announce earnings on Tuesday afternoon.A crowd of traders are scooping up ADBE on a strong ""buy the rumor"" rally since bouncing off its 50-day moving average last week. In all honesty, there was a great technical trade there for those who were looking at this pre-earnings strength.And normally, short interest on the stock is much higher than its current 1.5 days to cover, which suggests to us that we won't see as much of a shot higher in the immediate response to earnings.Still, our historical data shows that Adobe is a strong performer around earnings season. And the stock is lightly recommended by the analyst community, with just 79% of those covering ADBE - which is up 45% over the past year! - ranking it a buy.Here's how our models see this breakout playing out:Adobe should see a little selling pressure after its Tuesday announcement. This will set things up for a buyable dip that will allow nimble traders to grab this stock at a bargain.From there, the models are targeting a move above $155.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@7 Stocks to Buy on the Verge of Double-Digit Breakouts@2017-06-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-on-the-verge-of-double-digit-breakouts-2017-06-19

As a percentage of SWKS's recent stock price of $102.68, this dividend works out to approximately 0.27%, so look for shares of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. to trade 0.27% lower - all else being equal - when SWKS shares open for trading on 5/12/17. Similarly, investors should look for XLNX to open 0.54% lower in price and for AAL to open 0.21% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for SWKS, XLNX, and AAL, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.

 is set to report first-quarter 2017 results on May 3. Last quarter, the company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 21.28%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice while missing the same once in the trailing four quarters. It reported an average positive earnings surprise of 1.94%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company, is known for its automotive and chip identification business. It has seen massive growth in the portable device segment over the past year.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. We believe that this should boost NXP Semiconductors' first-quarter revenues.With the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products. We believe that this acquisition will add to the company's first-quarter earnings as it did in the previous four quarters.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corp., consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market remain headwinds. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that NXP Semiconductors will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP for NXP Semiconductors is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . NXP Semiconductors carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though this increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AMTEK Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.79% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  .Apple Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.00%, and a Zacks Rank #3.Just released, today's 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention. If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List, they should be removed immediately. These are sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments. However, from 1988 through 2016, stocks from our Strong Sell list have actually performed 6X worse than the S&P 500.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"alifornia-based chipmaker,  , reported better-than-expected earnings for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, marking its 12th consecutive quarter of earnings beat. Quarterly earnings also marked a significant year-over-year improvement.The company's earnings of 57 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. The figure also increased 5.6% from the year-ago quarter on the back of strong top-line growth. | Xilinx reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of approximately $609.5 million, up 6.7% year over year. In addition, the figure came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $606 million. The quarter marked the sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. On a sequential basis, the company's revenues grew roughly 4.1%.The robust revenue growth was mainly driven by strong sales of the company's 16nm, 20nm, and 28nm products. Notably, all the three products achieved record sales level during the quarter. The company also revealed that majority of the growth was contributed by solid performances in the automotive and test measurement and emulation markets.On the basis of End Market, sales at the Communications & Data Center division inched up 1% from the prior-year quarter, but declined 3% sequentially. Sales at the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense division increased 14% on a year-over-year basis and 8% sequentially. Revenues at Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive decreased 4% year over year and 13% sequentially.Product wise, revenues from Advanced products increased a whopping 36% year over year and 9% sequentially, driven mainly by strong sales of the 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm products. On the other hand, as expected, revenues from core products declined 11% from the year-ago quarter. However, the figure remained flat sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from North America, Europe and Asia Pacific increased 2%, 17% and 1%, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from Japan declined 7% year over year.Gross margin for the quarter expanded 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 69.5% and came in at the higher-end of the company's guidance range of 68-70%. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was mainly driven by favorable end-market mix.Operating expenses increased 15.2% to $250.2 million, which was $6 million higher than the company's previous forecast. This was so because Xilinx accelerated some 16-nm tape-out expenses to extend its technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.1%, reflecting a 310 bps year-over-year increase.Operating income declined 2.6% year over year to $164.4 million mainly due to higher operating expenses. In addition, operating margin contracted 270 bps as the benefit from improved gross margin was more than offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Net income for the quarter came in at $153.4 million as compared with $145 million in the year-ago quarter.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.32 billion compared with $3.25 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (excluding current portion) of about $995.2 million.During the quarter, Xilinx generated cash of $306 million from operations and incurred $20 million as capital expenditure. Additionally, the company paid $81.8 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $108.1 million during the quarter.In fiscal 2017, Xilinx generated cash of $934 million from operations and incurred $51.8 million as capital expenditure. Furthermore, the company paid $333 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $522 million during the fiscal.Concurrent with the fiscal fourth-quarter results, Xilinx announced that its board of directors has raised the quarterly cash dividend to 35 cents from 33 cents. The raised dividend will be paid on Jun 1 to shareholders of record date as on May 16.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects revenues in a range $600-$630 million (mid-point $615 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $612.08 million.Gross margin is anticipated to be between 68% and 70%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $242 million, which includes approximately $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Tax rate is projected to be between 12% and 15%.Keeping its earnings streak alive for the 12th successive quarter, Xilinx reported better-than-expected results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Also, the company's top and bottom lines both increased year over year. Its revenue guidance for the fiscal first quarter is also impressive as it is higher than our estimate at the mid-point.Shares of this California-based chipmaker rallied 4% higher in the after hour trade on the back of solid quarterly results and an encouraging guidance. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year. In the said period, shares of Xilinx gained 43.4%, outperforming 40.4% growth recorded by the Semiconductor-Pro Logic Device industry.Rising demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's product launches should further aid revenues.However, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, could adversely affect Xilinx's near-term results. Stiff competition from peers is another material headwind.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are STMicroelectronics  , Texas Instruments  and Advanced Micro Devices  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and Advanced Micro Devices have long-term expected earnings growth rate of 5%, 9.6% and 6.3%, respectively.Today you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 """"Strong Buys"""" free of charge.

"nvestors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options become available this week, for the December 15th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new December 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $60.50/share today.Because the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.83% return on the cash commitment, or 9.09% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $60.50/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.93% if the stock gets called away at the December 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

 reported first-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.79 per share, which improved significantly from a loss of $1.16 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.10 per share.NXP Semiconductors' revenues declined 1% year over year to $2.211 billion and was almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.210 billion.Revenues were hurt by a 3% decrease in Product revenues. Within the Product revenues Standard Products (STDP) decreased 57% year over year. However, Corporate & Other revenues increased 110% on a year-over-year basis. Also, High Performance Mixed Signal (HPMS) segment revenues increased 5% on a year-over-year basis.NXP Semiconductors' reported gross margin expanded from 26.8% on a year-over-year basis to 48.8%, primarily due to lower cost of sales. Non-GAAP gross profit margin during the quarter was 51.7% compared with 50% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company's operating margin came in at 75.9% during the quarter. The improvement was primarily due to the one-time gain related to the divestment of Standard Products and lower operating expenses (down 6.4% year over year). On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 27.1% compared with 23.3% reported in the year-ago period. The increase was mainly due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 45.1% from 47.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company's reported net income attributable to shareholders of $1.305 billion against net loss of $398 million in the year-ago quarter.NXP Semiconductors exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.24 billion compared with $1.89 billion reported in the previous quarter.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, NXP Semiconductors did not provide any guidance due to its pending acquisition by QUALCOMM Incorporated  .Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them.With the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corp.  , consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market remain headwinds.Currently, NXP Semiconductors has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 26. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.12%. Notably, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four trailing quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.46%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx designs and manufactures a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex-programmable logic devices (CPLDs).For the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing strong sales of its 16nm, 20nm, and 28nm products, mainly due to solid demand across markets such as data center, automotive, test & measurement, wired and wireless communications and space.We believe that increasing demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by the aforementioned factors, will support growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company's product launches should further aid revenues.Nonetheless, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region are likely to affect the company's near-term results. Also, competition from Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  remains a material headwind. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

"he Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological shift that is opening communication between the world's devices, and it looks poised to change the way the world operates -- and generate tremendous value along the way. While increasing device connectivity and insights stemming from data analytics are already having an impact, the IoT revolution is still in its early phases, and 2017 looks to be an influential year in the progression of the tech.To help readers navigate investing in this potentially massive tech trend, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to pick their choice for a top IoT stock to buy this year. Read on to learn why  (NYSE: IBM) ,  (NYSE: BBY) , and  (NASDAQ: XLNX) made the list.Image source: Getty Images. Much has been made of IBM's ""strategic imperatives,"" which include data security, mobile, cloud, and artificial-intelligence-driven solutions via its Watson supercomputer, but IoT doesn't get mentioned. Don't be fooled, though: Not only does IBM have serious plans to win its fair share of the skyrocketing IoT spending in the coming years, but it's ideally positioned to do so.Imagine the amount of data the 24 billion connected ""things"" estimated to be in the IoT by 2020 will amass. It's mind-boggling. Storing, analyzing, and ultimately developing actionable results from all that information will require an artificial-intelligence-driven computing wonder of enormous capabilities -- otherwise, what good is all the data? Which is where IBM's Watson IoT cloud platform enters the picture.The event may have flown under the radar, but IBM committed $3 billion to its IoT initiatives nearly two years ago. Since then it's acquired The Weather Company for $2 billion, utilizing Watson to analyze and provide insights from the 26 billion inquiries The Weather Company receives every day. IBM also just took the wraps off its new Watson IoT headquarters in Munich, Germany, with projects to further its reach and expand its capabilities even more.The data all the IoT devices generate in the coming years will only be as valuable as the ability to analyze it to assist business and government with everything from customer targeting to product development. When it comes to analyzing incredible amounts of data, IBM's Watson is in a class by itself, which is why IBM is an IoT stock to buy in 2017. Electronics retailer Best Buy has faced and survived some major challenges in recent years. One of them has been that while televisions, laptops, and other electronics have gotten better, they haven't changed dramatically. That makes it less likely a consumer will come into a store to see the latest model, which not only costs Best Buy sales, but also robs it of the opportunity to sell warranties or installation services.The explosion of IoT devices will benefit the retailer in two ways. First, shoppers are likely going to be more willing to come to stores to actually look at products in a category they are not very familiar with. This is already starting to happen in Best Buy stores as more shelf space has gone to connected-home products and other items in the broad IoT category.The second major benefit for Best Buy is that in many cases customers will want the benefits of IoT, but need help installing the devices. Even doing something simple like setting up an  Dash ordering button may be beyond the ability of some Best Buy customers. That should create service and Geek Squad sales opportunities for the retailer.Going forward, Best Buy could even increase this type of service by working with manufacturers to embed Geek Squad service calls into the functionality of more-complicated IoT devices. A smart appliance could in theory order its own repairs before it breaks, and the retailer would be well-positioned to handle some of those service calls. Many chip companies have been seeing strong momentum thanks to IoT, and Xilinx stands out as a leader in a semiconductor segment that could see continued benefits from growing machine-and-sensor connectivity. The chipmaker specializes in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) -- semiconductor solutions that can be programmed after manufacturing rather than having a set process.FPGAs are especially useful at the beginning of technology cycles, when the likelihood of changes and smaller market size make it less feasible to use expensive chips designed for a specific purpose. With the Internet of Things ushering in a range of new technologies that will change and evolve at a rapid pace, there's a good chance that FPGAs will see increased demand. The rollout of the 5G networks needed to facilitate the growing wave of machine-to-machine communication will be one source of momentum for programmable chips, but Xilinx has other opportunities related to IoT. 's acquisition of Xilinx's rival Altera for $16.7 billion in 2015 pointed toward the growing importance of FPGA chips for data centers. Notably, Xilinx is winning influential customers in the space, having recently signed deals with  and Amazon to provide data center solutions. The chipmaker's FPGAs will also be used for IoT-related technologies including machine learning, cloud computing, analytics, and machine vision.Those looking for returned income have another reason to consider adding Xilinx to their portfolios. The stock currently yields 2.2%, and the company has raised its payout for six years running. With strong growth potential and dividend income to fall back on in the event of market turbulence, Xilinx looks like an IoT stock to buy in 2017.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Semiconductors! Are they 'good as gold'? Or are they better than gold? In my informed top-down strategist opinion, these tech-y stocks could serve as your sole environment, if you want to invest in long-term growth potential. Semi makers and their helpers have become a standout. Of 696 publicly traded stocks in Zacks Computers and Technology sector, 84 are semi firms. Of those, 83 of 84 are in the top 37% of Zacks Industry Ranks. 37 listed semi stocks out of 84 in Zacks Industry Rank system fall above the top 17%. In short, semis stick out. Everyday stock pickers are fearful. They do not understand semi technology - aka the terms involved in very specific industry niches. For example, consider the terms Circuit Foundry, Memory, Programmable Logic, and Wafer Components. These confuse anyone -- without a technical background in Semiconductors.These stocks are 'stray' in the sense of representing a single semiconductor company located inside a single semiconductor industry. Such attractive stocks get overlooked in Zacks Industry Rank system, sometimes. I list these 4 by market capitalization.Just released, today's 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention. If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List, they should be removed immediately. These sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments.

any semiconductor stocks surged in 2016, thanks to rising demand for chips across multiple industries. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks many of the top names in the sector, rallied almost 50% over the past 12 months.But despite that robust performance, some semiconductor stocks could rise even further this year. Let's take a look at three chip plays that still have room to run:  (NASDAQ: XLNX) ,  (NASDAQ: MU) , and  (NASDAQ: AMD) .Image source: Getty Images.Xilinx is the largest maker of FPGA (field programmable gate array) chips in the world. These chips can be reprogrammed after being installed, making them well suited for a wide variety of machines -- including servers, connected cars, smart appliances, and airplanes. FPGAs are usually paired with traditional CPUs to handle industry-specific tasks. That's why  (NASDAQ: INTC) acquired Xilinx's only meaningful rival, Altera, in late 2015.That acquisition made Xilinx -- which launched 16nm chips a year before Intel caught up with 14nm ones -- a rumored takeover target for larger chipmakers like  . The Altera acquisition also convinced Intel's chipmaking rivals, like Qualcomm and  , to pair their CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs to match Intel's new programmable capabilities.Wall Street expects Xilinx's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 11% this year. It pays a forward dividend yield of 2.3%, and it's raised that payout annually for six straight years. Xilinx's P/E of 25 is a bit higher than its industry average of 22, but its growing network of partnerships and attractiveness as a takeover target shouldn't be ignored.Micron is often more volatile than other semiconductor stocks because demand for its DRAM and NAND memory chips is cyclical. Demand for those chips was sluggish throughout most of 2016, due to a slowdown in PC sales, the commoditization of the mobile device market, and a glut of memory chips crushing market prices.Image source: Micron.However, those trends reversed in late 2016, as many device makers reported shortages of memory chips and rising prices. That's why Micron posted double-digit sales growth over the past two quarters, which ended six straight quarters of annual declines. Analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 57% this year and for its non-GAAP earnings to surge from $0.06 to $2.42.Micron rallied more than 170% over the past 12 months, but it trades at just six times forward earnings -- indicating that the market remains pretty bearish on its chances (I'd argue that it's overly bearish). However, investors should beware of two major headwinds. First, competition from larger players like  and  's SanDisk could still put pressure on Micron's margins. Second, Micron warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the memory market with cheap chips in the near future, which could push Micron into a downward cycle again.AMD's upside potential might seem limited after rising nearly 400% over the past 12 months. Yet investors shouldn't ignore the chipmaker's compelling  . After years of being squeezed in x86 CPUs by  (NASDAQ: INTC) and high-end GPUs by  (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD carved out a growing niche in EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) chipsets for gaming consoles and other devices.Image source: AMD.That move enabled AMD to post three straight quarters of positive year-over-year sales growth -- which broke a two-year streak of top-line declines. Analysts expect AMD's revenue to rise 11% this year and for it to achieve non-GAAP profitability again following multiple years of net losses.As for AMD's valuation, its EV/sales ratio of 3.1 remains comparable to Intel's ratio of three and  lower than NVIDIA's ratio of 8.6.Besides gaming consoles, AMD plans to turn up the heat on NVIDIA with more low-end VR-ready GPUs and its next-gen Vega GPUs. It also plans to strike back at Intel with its new Ryzen chips, which offer comparable performance as Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips at lower price points. Those efforts could lift AMD to new highs, but the stock could also plunge if demand for these chips falls short of expectations.Xilinx, Micron, and AMD could all climb higher this year, but each of these companies face clear risks -- Xilinx faces upcoming FPGA battles with Intel, Micron faces challenges from bigger chipmakers, and AMD must land some meaningful blows against Intel and NVIDIA to maintain is momentum. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these pros and cons before buying any of these semiconductor stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

" month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 2.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Xilinx reported better-than-expected results in the third-quarter of fiscal 2017. The top and the bottom line also witnessed impressive year-over-year improvement.The company's earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding all other one-time items) of $0.52 per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.49. The figure also increased 6.1% from the year-ago quarter on the back of strong top-line growth and effective cost management.Xilinx reported fiscal third-quarter revenues of approximately $585.7 million, up 3.4% year over year and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $579 million. The quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. On a sequential basis, the company's revenues grew roughly 1.1%.The robust revenue growth was mainly driven by strong sales of the company's 16nm Ultrascale+, 20nm Ultrascale, and 28nm Zynq products. Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer said that ""The growth from these products was driven by a broad base of markets such as data center, automotive, test & measurement, wired and wireless communications and space"".Furthermore, the company's wireless business rebounded, mainly driven by 4G business in China and India as well as pre-5G deployment.On the basis of End Market, sales at the Communications & Data Center division increased 4% from the prior-year quarter and 7% sequentially. Sales at the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense division increased 5% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. However, revenues at Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive decreased 2% year over year and 13% sequentially.Product-wise, revenues from Advanced products increased a whopping 30% year over year and 2% sequentially, driven mainly by strong sales of 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm products. On the other hand, as expected, revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-ago quarter. However, it remained flat sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from Europe and Asia-Pacific increased 13% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from Japan and North America declined 14% and 3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Xilinx reported a 70 basis point (bps) contraction in adjusted gross margin on a year-over-year basis to 69.6%. Also, reported gross margin was above the company's guidance of 69%.Adjusted operating expenses increased 7.6% to $243 million as the company continues to strategically increase its investments in R&D. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.5%, reflecting a 160 bps year-over-year increase. On a reported basis, the company's operating expenses were $244.5 million, which was almost in-line with its own expectations of $245 million.Adjusted operating income of $164.4 million remained almost flat when compared with the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 100 bps as the benefit from improved gross margin was more than offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $143.3 million compared with $134.2 million.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.25 billion, compared with $3.49 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of about $994.8 million.During the quarter, Xilinx generated cash of $105.6 million from operations and incurred $19.9 million as capital expenditure. Moreover, the company paid $83.3 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $213.1 million during the quarter.In the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, Xilinx generated cash of $627.8 million from operations and incurred $51.8 million as capital expenditure. Moreover, the company paid $250.7 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $414 million during the first nine months of the current fiscal.Concurrent with fiscal third-quarter results, Xilinx announced that its board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share. The raised dividend will be paid on Feb 23 to shareholders of record date as on Feb 8.For the last quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects revenues in a range $590 million to $620 million (mid-point $605 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance for the fourth quarter is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $610.28 million.Gross margin is anticipated to be in between 68% and 70%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $244 million, which includes approximately $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Effective tax rate stands at approximately 14%.Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, Xilinx's stock has an average Growth Score of 'C', a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of 'D' on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'C'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is suitable for momentum and growth investors.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

"oday,  (NASDAQ: INTC) is the overwhelmingly dominant vendor of processors that power enterprise and cloud servers, with market share in both that's believed to be north of 90%. The company makes a lot of money from sales of such processors and related components and has been quite open about the fact that it's betting its future on its Data Center Group (DCG) business.Unfortunately for the company, there is plenty of competition emerging, which is a clear risk to the future financial performance of the DCG business unit.Image source: Intel.In a recent post on website Radio Free Mobile, the author makes the following observation with respect to the threat that companies building data center chips using the ARM architecture poses to Intel:The idea that Intel's DCG gross profit margins could come down in the face of robust competition is reasonable -- that's just common sense. However, I think the idea that Intel's consolidated gross profit margins, which came in at 63.2% on a non-GAAP basis, are higher than industry average (not the broader semiconductor industry, but the data center-oriented chip industry) isn't correct.There are many companies out there that sell components into the data center, though they may not necessarily sell  processors. Three companies that come to mind are  (NASDAQ: CAVM) ,  (NASDAQ: MLNX) , and  (NASDAQ: XLNX) .Let's see how their gross profit margin percentages stack up to Intel's.Cavium develops processors for network applications and provides other components into the networking/data center market such as network switches. It's also one of the few major ARM-based server processor vendors left standing.In 2016, Cavium's gross profit margin percentage -- excluding a one-time impact to its margins associated with its acquisition of QLogic -- was 63.3%. That's higher than Intel's.Mellanox is a data center connectivity chip provider. It sells Ethernet silicon, InfiniBand silicon, interconnect cables, and following its acquisition EZChip, a vendor of network processors, too. Its gross profit margin percentage in 2016 was 64.8%, a figure that was down from 71.8% in the prior year due to what the company says was ""an increase in intangible asset amortization costs of $39.7 million and inventory step-up amortization costs of $8.3 million, both related to the EZChip acquisition.""Even with those one-time whacks to gross profit margins due to the EZChip buy, its consolidated margins are  higher than Intel's.And finally, there's Xilinx. Xilinx builds programmable logic chips that are used in a variety of applications, including data centers. Its main competitor used to be a company called Altera, but Intel bought Altera and renamed it to the Intel Programmable Solutions Group. Year to date, Xilinx's gross profit margin percentage is just shy of 70%, once again quite a bit higher than Intel's.To be clear: Intel's gross profit margins are robust, but there are quite a few chip companies out there that can regularly turn in more than 60% gross profit margins.Furthermore, to maintain those gross profit margins, Intel spends substantially on research and development as well as on marketing. These days, as analysts are increasingly pointing out to Intel on its investor calls, Intel's operating margins are quite a bit below those of some of its peers precisely due to this spending.Now, turning to the risk posed by ARM-based server chip vendors (as well as vendors of competing chips using alternative architectures), I think said risk is a little more nuanced than simply ""Intel's margins will go down.""The volumes in this business are relatively low and the investments required to build and market successful products are quite high, so any potential vendor is going to want to sell products at relatively high gross profit margins to have a chance of profitability.So, while there is risk of gross profit erosion here due to potentially aggressive pricing on the part of new entrants, that might not be the biggest risk. Here are two serious ones that come to mind.The first risk is that data center chip buyers don't want to be beholden to a single vendor if possible, which may make said buyers more willing to explore/encourage alternative suppliers to keep on trying. How does a major data center with a vested interest in bringing its long-term component costs down? Perhaps by committing to buying some small but meaningful quantity of chips from companies that it hopes will become serious long-term players in this market (resulting in some volume/revenue share loss for Intel).The second risk is that data center workloads are becoming increasingly diverse, and so while a potential competitor to Intel might not be able to successfully gain share against Intel  , it could identify niches where Intel's current products are less than optimal and build targeted products for those niches.Intel's competitor in that case would still be able to sell its products at high prices and command high margins while still offering a total cost of ownership reduction relative to the Intel product to the potential buyer.In that case, Intel's gross profit margins wouldn't necessarily go down, but it could lose revenue share.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

 reported earnings of 32 cents per share in first-quarter 2017, which increased 14.3% from the year-ago quarter. It also came in line with the top end of management's guided range of 30-32 cents.Including stock-based compensation, the company reported earnings of 25 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.Revenues of almost $477 million increased 6.5% year over year and easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $473 million and was within management's guided range of $470-$480 million. | Notably, shares declined more than 4% in after-hour trading following unimpressive second-quarter guidance. Total revenue is expected in the range of $470-$480 million, up 4-6% on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues are expected to be in the -1% to 1% range on a sequential basis. We also note that the revenue range is lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $481.8 million.Similarly, non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 31-33 cents per share, which reflects 7-14% on a year-over-year basis. However, on a sequential basis, the earnings are projected in the range of -3% to 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate (including stock-based compensation expense) is currently pegged at 21 cents per share.Cadence has gained 32.7% as compared with the Zacks  industry's return of 11.5% on a year-to-date basis. However, the weak guidance can negatively impact share price momentum, in our view.Product and maintenance (94.7% of total revenue) increased 9.6% from the year-ago quarter to $451.4 million. However, services revenues plunged 29.4% to $25.5 million.Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Japan contributed 45%, 26%, 20% and 9% of the total revenue, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, contribution from Americas and Japan declined by 4% and 1%, respectively.Product wise revenues from Functional Verification, Digital IC Design and Signoff, Custom IC Design, System Interconnect and Analysis and IP contributed 23%, 29%, 26%, 10% and 12% of total revenue in the quarter, respectively.Management noted that semiconductor business conditions have stabilized with growth expected to be in the low-single digit range for 2017. As a part of System Design Enablement (SDE) strategy, the company continues to pursue opportunities in higher growth areas automotive, cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and aerospace & defense.The expansion of Renesas agreement reflects Cadence's growing clout in the automotive market. The company also launched a number of products like Xcelium and Protium S1 during the quarter. These new products won new customers like Xilinx  and Mellanox  .Strong adoption continued for Palladium Z1, with seven new customers, six of them being systems companies ordering the product in the quarter. Cadence noted that an additional seven customers made repeat orders.The recently launched Pegasus Verification System is also gaining traction with companies like Texas Instruments  and Microsemi buying the same.Meanwhile, stringent cost control helped operating margin (excluding stock-based compensation) to expand 10 basis points (bps) to 25.6% better than management's guidance of 25%. Operating margin (including stock-based compensation) contracted 10 bps on a year-over-year basis to 19.9%.Net cash from operating activities was $92.4 million as compared with $196.9 million in the previous quarter. Cadence ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $547.6 million better than $468.3 million at the end of fourth-quarter 2016.For second-quarter 2017, Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 26%, which is a slight improvement from 25% achieved in the year-ago quarter.For 2017, Cadence reiterated previously provided guidance. Total revenue is still forecasted between $1.900 and $1.950 billion, which reflects growth of 5-7%. However, the mid-point of the range is lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.94 billion.Recurring revenue is still expected to be more than 90%. Revenue from beginning backlog is still anticipated to be almost 70%.Non-GAAP operating margin is projected to be almost 27%, which is in line with 2016 reported figure.Non-GAAP earnings are also expected to be in the range of $1.32-$1.42 per share, which reflects almost 13% growth over 2016.

I will explain each unique niche first, and then explore each stock's narrative.In microelectronics, the  refers to the separation of a semiconductor fabrication plant operation (foundry) from an integrated circuit operation, into separate companies or business units.Although many companies continue to both design and manufacture integrated circuits (achieving efficiency through vertical integration), these integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) are not alone in the marketplace.Economic forces have led to the existence of many companies that only design devices, known as fabless semiconductor companies, as well as  that only manufacture devices under contract by other companies, without designing them.Integrated circuit production facilities are expensive to build and maintain. Unless they can be kept at nearly full utilization, they will become a drain on the finances of the company that owns them.The  uses two methods to avoid these costs: fabless companies avoid costs by not owning such facilities.Merchant foundries, on the other hand, find work from the worldwide pool of fabless companies, and by careful scheduling, pricing, and contracting keep their plants at full utilization.

They do not understand semi technology - aka the terms involved in very specific industry niches. The table shows there are lots of technical semi niches to look into.

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $59.23, changing hands for $59.51/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 13 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $45.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $70.00. The standard deviation is $6.942.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $59.23/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $59.23 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

 (NASDAQ: CELG) ,  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , and  (NYSE: ELLI) are three top stocks that our Motley Fool contributors would love to be able to buy if share prices dip. The companies operate in very different sectors, but they all have something in common: Each has a competitive advantage that makes it the go-to player in its industry. OK. I admit it took me less than 10 seconds to settle on Celgene as my pick. I already own shares in the biotech Goliath, but I'd love to see shares retreat so that I can add to my position.Image source: Getty Images.Celgene is the market-leading maker of drugs used to treat multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. Recently, the company has been moving into new indications to diversify its revenue.In 2014, management launched Otezla, an oral drug for treating psoriasis, and the launch has been one of the most successful ever in the indication. Last year, Otezla's sales already eclipsed the billion-dollar blockbuster mark, and with fourth-quarter sales up 67%, momentum doesn't appear to be slowing.The company also recently announced positive results from a late-stage trial for ozanimod, an oral multiple sclerosis (MS) drug. The study results were strong enough for Celgene to target filing an application for approval wth the Food and Drug Administration soon, and personally, I think the drug's safety profile could position it as best in class. If I'm right, then it could carve away a meaningful stake in an indication valued at $19 billion.Overall, Celgene thinks that its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) will hit $13 billion and $7.10, respectively, in 2017, and in 2020, they're forecasting sales and EPS of at least $21 billion and $13, respectively. With top-notch drugs on the market already, and the chance for another blockbuster launch in MS next year, this is one of my favorite stocks to buy. Xilinx is a semiconductor company that specializes in field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips. FPGAs are core components of wireless communications towers that appear to be gaining favor in data centers as well, because they allow accelerated processing and network speeds and can be reprogrammed to accommodate changes in a system. A leading position in the space allows Xilinx to benefit from the maturation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other computing and communications technologies.The company is providing solutions for the 5G networks that will facilitate IoT connectivity across network standards, and stands to see substantial sales momentum in conjunction with next-generation network rollouts in 2019 and 2020. It's also betting big on the Industrial Internet of Things, with chips tailored for machine vision and predictive-maintenance applications, and building a customer base that will give it a big role in shaping other emerging technologies.Xilinx recently signed a deal with Chinese internet company  to deliver machine-learning applications, and its FPGAs will also be used in connected autonomous cars -- the fastest-growing consumer IoT category.  also recently announced that it will be using Xilinx FPGAs in its cloud servers.With some of the world's biggest internet companies demonstrating increased need for programmable logic chips to meet the demands of cloud, networking, and IoT technologies, Xilinx looks like an attractive portfolio addition. Trading at roughly 26 times forward earnings, Xilinx doesn't appear unfairly valued compared to its growth potential, but it certainly stands out as a good stock to buy on the next dip. Immediately following the November election, real-estate investors panicked. Mortgage rates jumped over 4.1% for the first time since 2014. That caused shares of Ellie Mae to fall nearly 25% in a matter of weeks.The company offers Encompass -- a subscription-based platform for mortgage professionals to connect with one another. With higher rates, the thinking went, home buying and refinancing would screech to a halt, dampening the results at Ellie.The concerns weren't completely unfounded, as Ellie gets incrementally more money when transactions take place via its platform. But so far, they have proven overblown: In the fourth quarter, revenue was up 48%, net income jumped 126%, and revenue per active Encompass user grew 24%. Shares responded by jumping 25% from their November lows.The underlying story here is that Encompass benefits from two huge moats. The first -- high switching costs -- makes it unlikely that a mortgage professional would start looking for a competitor. It's too costly, in terms of time, money, and headaches, to do so. Just as important, a secondary moat is provided by the network effect. For professionals who are in any way involved in the real-estate market -- including underwriters, appraisers,  agents -- Encompass is the best place to drum up business.Put those two factors together, and I'll be licking my chops the next time mortgage rates jump and Ellie Mae investors get spooked.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Ellie Mae wasn't one of them!

 is set to report fourth-quarter 2016 results on Feb 1. Last quarter, the company recorded a negative earnings surprise of 20.4%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company, is known for its automotive and chip identification business and has seen massive growth in the portable device segment over the past year.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them.

" reported better-than-expected results in the third-quarter of fiscal 2017. The top and the bottom line also witnessed impressive year-over-year improvement.The company's earnings (including stock-based compensation but excluding all other one-time items) of 52 cents per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. The figure also increased 6.1% from the year-ago quarter on the back of strong top-line growth and effective cost management.Xilinx reported fiscal third-quarter revenues of approximately $585.7 million, up 3.4% year over year and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $579 million. The quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. On a sequential basis, the company's revenues grew roughly 1.1%.The robust revenue growth was mainly driven by strong sales of the company's 16nm Ultrascale+, 20nm Ultrascale, and 28nm Zynq products. Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx President and Chief Executive Officer said that ""The growth from these products was driven by a broad base of markets such as data center, automotive, test & measurement, wired and wireless communications and space"".Furthermore, the company's wireless business rebounded, mainly driven by 4G business in China and India as well as pre-5G deployment.On the basis of End Market, sales at the Communications & Data Center division increased 4% from the prior-year quarter and 7% sequentially. Sales at the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense division increased 5% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. However, revenues at Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive decreased 2% year over year and 13% sequentially.Product-wise, revenues from Advanced products increased a whopping 30% year over year and 2% sequentially, driven mainly by strong sales of 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm products. On the other hand, as expected, revenues from core products declined 12% from the year-ago quarter. However, it remained flat sequentially.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues from Europe and Asia-Pacific increased 13% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from Japan and North America declined 14% and 3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Xilinx reported a 70 basis point (bps) contraction in adjusted gross margin on a year-over-year basis to 69.6%. Also, reported gross margin was above the company's guidance of 69%.Adjusted operating expenses increased 7.6% to $243 million as the company continues to strategically increase its investments in R&D. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses amounted to 41.5%, reflecting a 160 bps year-over-year increase. On a reported basis, the company's operating expenses were $244.5 million, which was almost in-line with its own expectations of $245 million.Adjusted operating income of $164.4 million remained almost flat when compared with the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 100 bps as the benefit from improved gross margin was more than offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $143.3 million compared with $134.2 million. | Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $3.25 billion, compared with $3.49 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of about $994.8 million.During the quarter, Xilinx generated cash of $105.6 million from operations and incurred $19.9 million as capital expenditure. Moreover, the company paid $83.3 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $213.1 million during the quarter.In the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, Xilinx generated cash of $627.8 million from operations and incurred $51.8 million as capital expenditure. Moreover, the company paid $250.7 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $414 million during the first nine months of the current fiscal.Concurrent with fiscal third-quarter results, Xilinx announced that its board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of 33 cents per share. The raised dividend will be paid on Feb 23 to shareholders of record date as on Feb 8.For the last quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expects revenues in a range $590 million to $620 million (mid-point $605 million). The mid-point of the company's guidance for the fourth quarter is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $610.28 million.Gross margin is anticipated to be in between 68% and 70%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $244 million, which includes approximately $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Effective tax rate stands at approximately 14%.Keeping its earnings streak alive for the eleven successive quarters, Xilinx once again reported better-than-expected results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Also, the company's top and bottom line both increased year over year.However, the company's revenue guidance for the fourth quarter was slight disappointing as it fell short of our estimate at the mid-point.Nonetheless, increasing demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's new product launches should further aid revenues.Notably, the California-based chipmaker has outperformed the Zacks categorized Semiconductor-Pro Logic Device industry in the last one year. In the said period, shares of Xilinx gained 27.8%, outperforming the  industry's gain of 22.4%.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

n Dec 31, 2016, Zacks  upgraded  to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). With a robust return of 31.8% over the past one year, positive estimate revisions over the last 60 days and strong fundamentals, Xilinx is an attractive investment opportunity.Over the past 60 days, fiscal 2017 estimates were revised upward, taking the Zacks Consensus Estimate up from $2.24 per share to $2.25 per share. Xilinx also delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 6.9%.Moreover, combined with other attractive features like high return on equity (ROE) and high return on assets (ROA), the stock looks very attractive. While its ROE indicates that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return, ROA is the profit that it earns for every dollar of its assets. Xilinx currently trades at a ROE of 23.2%, much higher than the industry average of 18.8%. Notably, the company has an ROA of 12.3% compared with the industry average of 10.7%.Another metric to consider here is the Price/Cash Flow ratio, which should be less than X-Industry. This measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock. Xilinx currently trades at a forward P/FCF of 18.5x compared with the industry group's average of 21.9x.Over the last six months, Xilinx has increased 30.7% compared with the Zacks categorized Electronic-Semiconductors industry that increased just 26.6%. The stock's long-term earnings per share growth rate is 8.25%.NVIDIA and Broadcom have a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10.3% and 13.59%, respectively.Increasing demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, is expected to drive growth. The company's new product launches should further aid revenues, going forward.We are also encouraged by Xilinx's endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. Notably, during fiscal 2016, the company returned over $762 million through share buyback and dividend payments. Continuing with its policy of returning cash to shareholders, the company paid $367.6 million as cash dividends and share repurchases during the first half of fiscal 2017. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also increase investors' confidence and loyalty.However, competition from the likes of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  remains a material headwind.Besides Xilinx, investors may consider NVIDIA Corporation  and Broadcom Limited  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@SOXX, MU, XLNX, LRCX: Large Inflows Detected at ETF@2017-02-01@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/soxx-mu-xlnx-lrcx-large-inflows-detected-etf-2017-02-01
inding the best performing stocks that are worth adding to your portfolio can be a challenging task. The factors that investors consider while creating a lucrative portfolio include share price and a continued uptrend in estimates.At the moment  is well poised to be added to one's portfolio. Over the last six months, Xilinx has increased 33.2% compared with the Zacks categorized Electronic-Semiconductors industry that has increased just 30.6%. The stock's long-term earnings per share growth rate is 8.25%.Micron and Broadcom have a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10% and 13.59%, respectively.Also, the shares of Xilinx touched a new 52-week high of $61.07 on Dec 27, eventually closing at $61.24. Further, estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have witnessed an uptrend. In the past 60 days, fiscal 2016 estimates moved north from $2.24 per share to $2.25 per share.Although the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter of fiscal 2017 results more than two months back, shares of Xilinx continue to trend higher and are up 23% since then. The top and the bottom line also witnessed impressive year-over-year improvement.Revenues by end markets (Communications & Data Center, Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive and Industrial, Aerospace & Defense) registered year-over-year growth.Increasing demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's new product launches should further aid revenues.Xilinx is set to capitalize on the global trend of PLDs replacing ASICs. There are certain fundamental advantages of using FPGAs over low-cost ASICs. One of the basic reasons is the difficulty in getting suitable ASICs for a design and the additional cost of re-certifying new ASIC-based designs. FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. We believe Xilinx is well equipped with FPGA product suites (Virtex-7, Kintex-7, Zynq-7000, Virtex-6, Virtex-5, Kintex UltraScale and Spartan-6) to secure a major share of the growing PLD market.We are also encouraged by Xilinx's endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. Over the last 10 years, the company has returned approximately 100% of its operating cash flow to its shareholders and has repurchased approximately $2 billion of its common stock since 2010. It should be noted that in May 2016, the company's board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. Furthermore, Xilinx has regularly paid quarterly cash dividends for the past 11 years.

"he stock market bounced back on Thursday, regaining some of its lost ground from the previous day following news of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. High rates helped send the U.S. dollar to levels it hasn't seen in nearly 15 years, and that had a positive influence on the overall market, even as it sent certain sectors, especially the , down sharply.Some individual stocks did quite well, and  (NYSE: LLY) ,  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , and  (NASDAQ: IDCC) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.Image source: Eli Lilly.Eli Lilly climbed 5% after reassuring investors about its future growth prospects. The drugmaker essentially confirmed that its expectations for the rest of the decade remained intact, including revenue growth averaging at least 5% per year and ongoing increases in gross margin moving forward. Lilly also said that it remains committed to reducing operating expenses to less than half of revenue by 2018, while delivering dividend increases on an annual basis.Even though the company suffered a setback when its solanezumab candidate treatment for Alzheimer's disease failed to reach its primary endpoint in phase 3 clinical trials, Lilly is optimistic about other prospects, including type-2 diabetes treatment Trulicity and cancer-fighter Cyramza. With adjusted earnings guidance remaining unchanged, at $3.50 to $3.60 per share for fiscal 2016, and new guidance for $4.05 to $4.15 in adjusted earnings for 2017, Lilly shareholders seemed pleased with the company's resiliency.Xilinx was up 6% in the wake of positive analyst comments. Analysts at  upgraded the stock from equal weight to overweight, and they boosted their price target on the stock from $46 to $67 per share. As we saw with  yesterday, Xilinx has the potential to benefit from the rise of the machine-learning sector in the semiconductor industry, opening the door to customized specialty chips that could help it improve its market share.In particular, as the industry evolves toward more sophisticated applications, Xilinx has taken an early lead and has won confidence from key customers. If that trend fully takes hold, then Xilinx could continue to see big gains into 2017.Finally, InterDigital gained 7%. The mobile technology research-and-development company said that it has updated its fourth-quarter revenue guidance, now expecting $258 million to $268 million in sales for the period. Going forward, InterDigital said that it believes that its royalty platform should be able to bring in between $360 million and $380 million on an annual basis.Overall, because of InterDigital's work in firming up agreements with top customers on an extended basis, CEO William Meritt believes that the company is ""well-positioned to drive toward our goals of $500 million to $600 million in annual recurring revenue from our core terminal unit licensing business and $75 million to $100 million from our [Internet of Things] business."" Investors were pleased with that news, as it points to a nice push higher for InterDigital in the long run.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Eli Lilly and Co. wasn't one of them!

"nvestors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2017 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new February 2017 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.06. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $55.44 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $59.03/share today.Because the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.58% return on the cash commitment, or 22.16% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $57.50 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.35. If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $59.03/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.62% if the stock gets called away at the February 2017 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.98% boost of extra return to the investor, or 24.63% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 29%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.

hareholders of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.2% annualized dividend yield can sell the June 2017 covered call at the $65 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.88 bid, which annualizes to an additional 6.5% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 8.8% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $65 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but XLNX shares would have to advance 10.2% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 13.4% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.2% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June 2017 covered call at the $65 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $65.

American Century Ultra (  ), a marquee name in the mutual fund industry, had a dynamite third quarter. Its 6.49% gain popped past the 5.59% average surge of its large-cap growth rivals as tracked by Morningstar. And the fund soared above the S&P 500, which tacked on a relatively modest 3.85% advance.So far in Q4 the $8.2 billion  is down 1.93%, going into Thursday. A lot of that is due to a slide by technology and tech-related names that dominate the fund's top holdings. They have been out of investors' favor in recent weeks.

(SBUX) is another. The coffee-shop chain has a modest 70 Comp Rating. Shares recently retook their 10-week moving average, a sign its recent downtrend may be ending.Meanwhile, some health care holdings have already provided lift for American Century Ultra, with runs that began in the days before the election.Managed care provider  (UNH) and biotech  (CELG) are among the fund's top 10 holdings and have Comp Ratings of 88 and 97 respectively. They benefited as investors rotated into health care stocks amid expectations that a Republican Congress and White House will ease pressure for new pricing rules for drugs.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Notable ETF Inflow Detected - RSP, XLNX, MDLZ, CLX@2016-12-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-etf-inflow-detected-rsp-xlnx-mdlz-clx-2016-12-30

"n recent trading, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $52.50, changing hands for $52.83/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Xilinx, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $46.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $65.00. The standard deviation is $5.664.But the whole reason to look at the  XLNX price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with XLNX crossing above that average target price of $52.50/share, investors in XLNX have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $52.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Xilinx, Inc.:

Also, increase in High Performance Mixed Signal (HPMS) segment revenues (up 80.3% on a year-over-year basis) positively impacted the quarter's results.NXP Semiconductors' reported gross margin contracted 67 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 47.9%, primarily due to higher cost of sale. Non-GAAP gross profit margins during the quarter came in at 50.5% compared with 49.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company's operating margin decreased to 7.1% from 24.6% reported in the year-ago quarter. On a Non-GAAP basis operating margins came in at 27.9% compared with 29.5% reported in the year-ago period. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased to 40.9% from 24.2% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company's reported net income attributable to shareholders came in at $91 million compared with $361 million reported in the year-ago quarter.NXP Semiconductors exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.57 billion compared with $1.33 billion reported in the previous quarter.

However, the company provided an encouraging fourth quarter revenue guidance.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them.With the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corp.  , consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market remain headwinds.Currently, NXP Semiconductors has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

nvestors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Xilinx is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for XLNX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 55 cents per share for XLNX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for XLNX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.85% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that XLNX has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

he third-quarter 2016 earnings season has commenced on a better note that last quarter, with big banks reporting positive results. However, growth trends are still dreary particularly due to weakness in the energy and technology sector.As per the latest  report, overall third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to be down 2.2% from the year-ago quarter on a 1.5% increase in revenues.Earnings for the Technology sector are anticipated to be down 1.7% on 1.1% lower revenues. Apple's guidance, which projects an earnings decline of 20.6% on 9.6% lower revenues, will deal a major blow to the sector's earnings.

Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Seagate recently announced preliminary results for the first quarter.

 is scheduled to report third-quarter 2016 results on Oct 19,  .Last quarter, the company recorded a positive 7.61% earnings surprise. Moreover, the company beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with the average earnings surprise at 28.97%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.A major positive for Citrix is its impressive product portfolio. The company regularly innovates and employs cutting-edge technology to enhance its product portfolio. In fact, it launched a string of new products and enhancements especially for its NetScaler App. The company's desktop virtualization segment is also expected to drive top-line growth.However, the company's extensive global presence exposes it to foreign exchange volatility. Earnings might also be affected by slow-paced economic growth in major economies as well as intense competition from peers.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Citrix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.

 is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 19. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.9%. Notably, the stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the four trailing quarters with an average positive surprise of approximately 4.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Xilinx's Most Accurate estimate stands at 55 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 54 cents, resulting in an Earnings ESP of +1.85%. Thus, the combination of the company's Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter. | The California-based chipmaker, Xilinx designs and manufactures a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable devices. Increasing demand for 28-nm, 20-nm and 16-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, is expected to continue driving growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Furthermore, we expect the company's revenues from 28-nm products to increase throughout fiscal 2017, aided by steady demand in communications, and continued strong adoption in the Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets. Moreover, design wins from other sectors such as wired communication, data center and industrial will add to revenues. While the scramble for share at advanced nodes continues, strength at the legacy nodes offers near-term support to the business, in our opinion.Additionally, we are optimistic about the company's recent decision to tap the fast-growing cloud computing, embedded, industrial IoT, and 5G markets which is likely to boost its revenues.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Boyd Gaming Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

"Although earnings season is right around the corner, I wanted to do some early research on  (NASDAQ:  ) while shares are near 52-week peaks.The company has matched or topped earnings estimates during three of the past four quarters by 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent, with a match in the mix. Revenues have topped estimates during the past three quarters but missed by $1.58 million in the year-ago period.Gross margins have pushed 70% over the past year, which is a number that analysts will want to see sustained. A number below this level or a lowered outlook on an earnings miss could send shares sharply lower.XLNX stock's next earnings report is scheduled to be released on Oct. 19, and current estimates are pegged at 55 cents a share on revenue just south of $575 million.I love the technical and fundamental picture for Xilinx, and analysts have been mostly bullish on the stock throughout the year. In mid-August, one of the suits-and-ties raised their price target on XLNX stock from  while keeping an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.In June, with shares at $46, another brokerage firm reiterated its ""outperform"" rating and  . On the other hand, at the start of the month, an analyst out of Goldman Sachs lowered their rating to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" and set a $51 price target. The reason cited was ""limited upside,"" with shares closing above $47 the prior session.In May, the company's board approved a $1 billion share-buyback program. This was a bullish sign, and it came a few weeks after Xilinx lowered its earnings forecast and outlook in late April.

The company has been subject to takeover rumors throughout the year, with  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and China's  floated as possible suitors.Earlier this year, the company filed a change in control provision, with the SEC saying that it would provide additional benefits to its top executives if XLNX stock is acquired.) iPhone 8 Will Be a 10th Anniversary MasterpieceThe chances of the company being acquired are real. However, I don't believe that management appears anxious to sell given the terrific business it has developed and the long-term growth opportunities in autonomous driving. With a market cap of just over $13 billion, a 50% premium would value the company at $20 billion for roughly a $75-per-share buyout offer.While I don't like buying stocks on rumors, I do like the technical and fundamental setup for Xilinx going forward.The post ) Fundamentals Look Strong appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Xilinx, Inc.

"Image source: Intel.If Intel's 14-nanometer technology really delivers a significant benefit over TSMC's 16-nanometer technology, then perhaps the conventional thinking with respect to timing and ultimate market share might not hold in this case.Generally speaking, there's a significant lead time between when a product begins sampling to customers and when final product is shipping in significant quantities to those customers. The delta between sampling and commercial, high-volume shipments can often be a year or even longer.I expect that based on the sampling timelines for both Intel and Xilinx, Xilinx will wind up shipping final 14/16-nanometer chips to customers first. However, if Stratix 10 winds up being a better solution, in terms of performance, power, and/or features, then Intel could very well be positioned to edge past Xilinx in terms of 14/16-nanometer FPGA share out in time.A while back, now former Intel CFO Stacy Smith  at an investor conference that the execution problems on Stratix 10 were due in no small part to Altera's ""having some issues with current-generation products,"" requiring the chipmaker to divert resources from Stratix 10 to those other products.However, Smith made it clear that because Altera is now folded into Intel, the company will be better positioned to achieve improved time-to-market on future FPGA products manufactured on Intel technology.Investors will just have to wait and see how it all plays out over the next couple of years. But, at least for now, the first FPGA manufactured in Intel's 14-nanometer technology is finally alive and making its way into the hands of potential customers -- a reasonable start.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.85%. Notably, the stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the four trailing quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.99%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The California-based chipmaker reported better-than-expected results during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The top line improved year over year, while stabilizing trends were witnessed across all of the company's end-market segments. In spite of all these factors, the company has provided a soft revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.A slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, could impact Xilinx's quarterly results. The company has also been facing a new set of challenges related to the acquisition of Altera by Intel. The acquisition has provided Intel a strategic advantage over Xilinx.Additionally, higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities could dent the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  is a material headwind.Nonetheless, we are optimistic about the company's recent decision to tap the fast-growing cloud computing, embedded, industrial IoT and 5G markets, which is likely to drive its revenues in the long run. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP for Xilinx is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents. Xilinx's Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Open Text Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #1.Boyd Gaming Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The Spansion deal should start pulling its weight, and a number of smaller plug-in acquisitions are also champing at the bit.Perhaps the biggest challenge for Cypress won't be found in the ever-changing market environment, nor in the struggle to integrate several important buyouts.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Monday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.32), with the stock changing hands as low as $43.54 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.04 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.81/share today.Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $46.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $49.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.92% if the stock gets called away at the August 5th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $49.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $49.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

alifornia-based semiconductor maker,  recently announced that its board of directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. However, management stated that the timing and number of shares to be bought will depend upon prevailing market conditions as well as other factors.Xilinx has a steady track record of returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payouts. Over the last 10 years, the company has returned approximately 100% of its operating cash flow to its shareholders and has repurchased approximately $1.8 billion of its common stock since 2010.Furthermore, Xilinx has regularly paid quarterly cash dividends for the past 11 years. The company started paying 5 cents per share as quarterly dividend in fiscal 2004 and has raised the amount every year to the present level of 33 cents. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of 17%.During the recently concluded fiscal 2016, Xilinx returned approximately $443 million and $319 million to shareholders through share buyback and quarterly dividends, respectively.The company's strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives and scope for product innovation and expansion in newer markets. The company generated operating cash flow of $730 million in fiscal 2016 and ended the period with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of nearly $3.34 billion.Some other companies that have a consistent track record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments include Yahoo! Inc.  and Accenture plc  .We believe that such initiatives not only enhance shareholder return but also raise the market value of a stock. Through dividend payouts, companies bolster investors' confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Xilinx remains confident on its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further rise in shareholder value.However, a soft revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 keeps us concerned about the company's near-term growth prospects. Moreover, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, could impact Xilinx's near-term results. Stiff competition from Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  is another material headwind.Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Scientific Beta US ETF (Symbol: SCIU), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $27.08 per unit.With SCIU trading at a recent price near $24.70 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.64% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SCIU's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Ashland Inc (Symbol: ASH), Rite Aid Corp. (Symbol: RAD), and Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX). Although ASH has traded at a recent price of $111.04/share, the average analyst target is 17.07% higher at $130.00/share. Similarly, RAD has 16.52% upside from the recent share price of $8.01 if the average analyst target price of $9.33/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting XLNX to reach a target price of $48.47/share, which is 12.76% above the recent price of $42.98. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ASH, RAD, and XLNX:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
  
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

"nvestors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options become available this week, for the August 19th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new August 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $46.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.01. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $46.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.99 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $46.46/share today.Because the $46.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.37% return on the cash commitment, or 27.03% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $46.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $47.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.67. If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $46.46/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $47.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.76% if the stock gets called away at the August 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing XLNX's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $47.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $47.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

However, the figure dropped approximately 7% from the year-ago quarter figure of 58 cents.Xilinx's fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $571.1 million inched up 0.7% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $566 million. The improvement was mainly driven by robust sales of new products. Moreover, during the quarter, the company witnessed stabilizing trends across its end-market segments.Sales at the Communications & Data Center division increased 5% year over year but remained flat sequentially. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive grew 1% year over year and 6% sequentially.

Sequentially, revenues from New products and Mainstream increased 3% and 4%, while the sales of Support and Base products decreased 1% and 6%, respectively.Xilinx reported a 10 basis point (bps) contraction in gross margin (including stock-based compensation expenses but excluding other one-time items) on a year-over-year basis to 69.8% mainly because of a customer mix shift to larger customers and higher ramp-up costs incurred due to aggressive product introductions.Adjusted operating expenses increased 0.9% to $215.9 million, but remained below the company's expectations. As a percentage of revenues, the figure was flat year over year at 37.8%.Xilinx's adjusted operating margins contracted 20 bps year over year to 29.1% mainly due to lower gross margin. In terms of dollars, adjusted operating income remained almost flat at $182.7 million.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $3.34 billion, compared with $3.6 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of about $1.58 billion.During the quarter, Xilinx generated $122.9 million cash from operations and incurred $14.8 million in capital expenditure. The company paid $78.9 million as cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $143.2 million.Concurrent with its fiscal fourth-quarter results, Xilinx announced that its board of directors has increased the quarterly cash dividend to 33 cents per share from 31 cents. The increased dividend will be paid on Jun 8 to the shareholders of record date as of May 18.Despite reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results, the company provided disappointing revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Management expects revenues to be flat sequentially at $571 million, which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $575 million.Gross margin is predicted to be between 69% and 70%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $220 million, which includes approximately $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Share count is expected to be roughly 266 million, while the effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 14%.The California-based chipmaker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results. Its top-line results improved year over year while the company witnessed stabilizing trends across all its end-market segments.Xilinx's revenues at Communications & Data Center; and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive registered year-over-year growth, while sales at the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense end-market witnessed a decline.Moreover, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's product launches should further boost revenues.Nonetheless, the company provided a soft revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.Moreover, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weakness in Europe and the Asia-Pacific could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  remains a material headwind.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A couple of better-rankled stocks in the broader technology sector are Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  and Broadcom Limited  , both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

s we approach the busiest week of the Q1 earnings cycle, the technology sector is expected to remain in the limelight. So far, the earnings scenario for the overall sector is pretty unimpressive. In fact, per the latest  report, earnings for the overall Technology sector will decline 5.8% year over year in the quarter.This week, investors will be watching semiconductor stocks closely as a number of companies in this space are expected to come up with their quarterly results. The industry has been struggling since the last year as global economic headwinds, such as the slowdown in China and the strengthening dollar. Notably, the overall earnings of semiconductor industry witnessed year-over-year decline of 13.1% and 9.7% in 4Q15 and 3Q15, respectively.Last week, a few major chip makers like Intel  and Advanced Micro Devices  released disappointing earnings results for the quarter.This week, we hope to gain better visibility on where the semiconductor industry is heading as three leading companies in the space - SanDisk Corp.  , Xilinx Inc.  and Texas Instruments Inc.  - report their quarterly results on Apr 27. , which designs, manufactures, and markets flash memory storage products that are used in a wide variety of electronic systems, will report first-quarter 2016 results.

" (  ) - XLNX stock gapped up on Jan. 21 after the chipmaker delivered its fiscal third-quarter report. Revenue declined 4.6% year over year to $566.2 million, while adjusted earnings fell 21% to 49 cents per share.While sales and profits were down, the company still beat analysts' expectations on both the top and bottom line. However, the rally in XLNX stock was largely attributed to fresh buyout hopes.Along with the quarterly report, Xilinx, which makes programmable chips for communications infrastructure, automobiles and industrial uses, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had entered into a change-of-control provision that protects five senior executives, including the CEO, in the event of a change of ownership.Following the earnings release, BMO Capital Markets upgraded XLNX stock to ""Outperform"" from ""Market Perform"" and raised its price target to $57 from $44. Last week, its analysts increased their target again, this time to $60, noting the company's solid financial position, reasonable debt levels and expanding profit margins.Turning to the chart, XLNX stock rose from a low around $36 in October 2014 to a high above $50 in early December, a gain of 40% in about 14 months.My proprietary internal indicator, the Collins-Bollinger Reversal (CBR) has proved accurate with XLNX stock, correctly signaling both buys and sells. It triggered a sell signal at the December high, and on Jan. 15, it flashed a buy signal at about $40. Another CBR buy signal was triggered on March 7 at $46.My initial upside target for XLNX stock is $50, which is 5% above the current price. However, if a takeover were to occur, the return could be much greater, making shares worth a modest investment at current prices. The downside risk in XLNX stock is likely limited to $42.Click to EnlargeThe post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Trade of the Day: XLNX Stock is Worth Taking a Gamble On@2016-03-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-day-xlnx-stock-worth-taking-gamble-2016-03-22

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 25. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 8.70%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company, is known for its automotive and chip identification business and has seen massive growth in the portable device segment over the past year. The trend is expected to continue in the first quarter as well.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. This should boost NXP Semiconductors' first quarter revenues.With the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corp., consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are likely to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that NXP Semiconductors will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP for NXP Semiconductors is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 83 cents per share. NXP Semiconductors has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Silicon Motion Technology Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +7.27% and a Zacks Rank #1Barracuda Networks, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +200.00% and a Zacks Rank #1Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"ntel's Altera buy was primarily to bolster its position in the server room. Image source: Intel.Last year, chip giant  announced its intention to acquire programmable logic chip specialist, Altera, in a deal valued at about $16.7 billion. The strategic rationale behind this acquisition boiled down to two main themes.Frist, Intel hoped to give Altera's core stand-alone Field Programmable Gate Array, or FPGA, business a competitive advantage by transitioning the substantial majority of Altera's products away from third-party contract manufacturers and toward its own manufacturing technology.Secondly, and probably more importantly, Intel wants to be able to integrate FPGA technology directly into its Xeon processors. This, the company argues, should give major customers the ability to configure these processors to accelerate algorithms that are important to customers.This rationale is solid, but there have been reasons to be skeptical of Intel and Altera's execution. For example, the Intel-built 14-nanometer FPGA, known as Stratix 10, that Altera has been working on appears to have been delayed and will make it to market later than a comparable FPGA from rival  .At a recent investor conference, Intel CFO Stacy Smith shed some light on why the product was delayed. Smith made it clear that the delay of Altera's Stratix 10 was an Altera-specific issue rather than an Intel one. Perhaps more interestingly, though, he indicated that the problem was due to resource allocation within Altera.""We learned in the diligence [Altera was] having some issues with current generation products,"" Smith said. ""They had to make some resource decisions and so they slowed down the first generation [of products] that's landing on the Intel process technology.""That being said, now that Altera is part of Intel, Smith claims that Intel has worked to ""accelerate"" the pace at which work is getting done on the first Intel-built FPGA and hopes that the company can ""accelerate it a bit more."" He continued, ""As we get to the next generation, we get back on the [product release] cadence that [Intel] expected."" It's good to know that Intel is working to iron out the issues that Altera was facing with Stratix 10. In order to realize the full value of this acquisition over time, Intel will need to deliver on its promise of making Altera more competitive -- by using Intel process technology -- than it would have been otherwise.However, the far more interesting part of this acquisition is the eventual integrated FPGA/Xeon processor product. Intel has said previously that it's sampling parts with a separate FPGA die placed on the same package as a Xeon processor, but a true integrated part -- one that combines the FPGA circuitry with the processor in a single piece of silicon -- is still a while out.Now that Altera is officially part of Intel, I hope that at Intel's next analyst meeting in Nov. 2016, the company goes into some depth about when it expects such an integrated part to arrive. Given that the acquisition closed in late 2015, and given that it takes several years to design and validate a complex server chip, I wouldn't expect such a product to arrive before 2018, with 2019 or later appearing more likely.Cable is dying.

fter an astounding performance in October-December 2015 period, the technology sector lost its luster thanks to global headwinds and a spate of disappointing earnings reports. Total earnings for 89.5% of the sector's total market capitalization that have reported so far are up just 0.1% on 2.3% revenue growth.However, the beat ratios are impressive with 76.1% of the companies beating on earnings and 60.9% trumping revenue estimates. However, some of them issued a disappointing revenue outlook.Let's dig into the individual performances: , the world's largest chipmaker, reported solid Q4 results surpassing our earnings estimates by 11 cents and revenue estimates by $0.1 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share were flat while revenues grew 1%. For Q1, Intel expects revenues in the range of $13.6-$14.6 billion - the midpoint of which was well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.76 billion at the time of the earnings release. For fiscal 2016, revenues are expected to grow in mid-to-high single digits (read:  ). topped our earnings estimate by a couple of cents but missed on revenues by $140 million. For the ongoing first quarter, the company expects revenues in the range of $2.85-$3.09 billion and earnings per share of 57-67 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter at the time of issuing the guidance was $3.13 billion for revenue and 64 cents for earnings.First-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings at  came in at 85 cents per share, beating our estimate by 7 cents. Revenues of $5.77 billion were ahead of our estimate of $5.69 billion. The company guided revenues of $4.9-$5.7 billion and earnings per share of 77-87 cents for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter at the time of issuing the guidance was $5.66 billion for revenue and 78 cents for earnings. reported adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $566 million edged past our estimate of $555 million. The company provided an encouraging fiscal fourth-quarter outlook wherein it expects revenues to be flat sequentially at $566 million, which was very close to the Zacks Consensus Estimate $568 million at the time of issuing the guidance.The series of earnings beat was unable to energize the semiconductor ETFs amid eroding investor confidence in the broad technology sector. Nevertheless, the beaten down prices could create an attractive entry opportunity for bargain hunters as the four semiconductor ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 3 (Hold). These funds are down nearly 7% over the past one month. Below, we have highlighted these in detail (read:  ).This ETF follows the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 domestic firms. The in-focus four firms are among the top 10 holdings accounting for a combined 28.3% share in the basket. About 55% of the portfolio is dominated by large cap stocks while mid caps take the remainder, with just 7% going to small caps. The fund has amassed $409.3 million in its asset base and trades in solid average volume of roughly 592,000 shares a day. The product charges 48 bps in fees a year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1.This fund tracks the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index, holding 41 stocks in its portfolio. It is widely spread across a number of securities as none of these allocates more than 3.9% of the assets. The product has a definite tilt toward small cap stocks at 69% while the rest is split between the other two market cap levels. The fund is less popular with AUM of $177.8 million and average daily volume of around 180,000 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (see:  ).This fund provides exposure to 26 securities by tracking the Market Vectors US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. Of these, four firms - INTC, QCOM, TXN and XLNX - occupy the first, third, fifth and eleventh spots, respectively, collectively accounting for more than one-third of the portfolio. From a market cap look, the product focuses on large cap stocks, which account for about 75% of the portfolio. The product has managed assets worth $166.4 million and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. It is heavily traded with volume of around 4 million shares per day and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3.This fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 28 securities with TXN and INTC taking the top two positions in the basket with nearly 6% each. XLNX is also among the top 10 holdings making up for 3.60% share. Here again, the ETF is skewed toward small caps at 52% while mid caps and large caps account for 26% and 22%, respectively. The product, with AUM of $46.4 million is often overlooked by investors and hence sees a lower average daily volume of 24,000 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.63%.

 is expected to report fourth-quarter 2015 results on Feb 3. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.93%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company, is known for its automotive and chip identification business and has seen massive growth in the portable device segment over the past one year. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. This should boost NXP Semiconductors' fourth-quarter revenues.Further, this will be the first full quarter after NXP Semiconductors completed the Freescale Semiconductor buyout.With the acquisition, NXP Semiconductors has now become the world's leading provider of automotive semiconductor solutions and general purpose microcontroller products. The company had earlier stated that the acquisition would be accretive to its non-GAAP earnings per share in the first full year and would generate more than $10 billion as revenues.Apart from this, the deal will help NXP to achieve cost savings of $200 million in the first full year and $500 million in annual cost synergies thereafter. Thus, it would be interesting to find out how NXP Semiconductors is gaining from the integration of Freescale.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are likely to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that NXP Semiconductors will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP for NXP Semiconductors is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 83 cents per share. NXP Semiconductors sports a Zacks Rank #1 which, when combined with an ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Harris Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.21% and a Zacks Rank #2.MSCI Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shares of semiconductor specialist  soared today, up by 10% as of 11:30 am ET, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter. Revenue rose 7% sequentially to $566 million, although that was down 5% year over year. Net income added up to $131 million, or $0.49 per share. The bottom line was right on target with Street expectations, but the top line easily beat the $554 million consensus estimate. Gross margin was 68.5%. CEO Moshe Gavrielov said that new products drove the strong results, particularly 7-series and UltraScale products. Those product families each hit new sales records during the quarter and were strong across a broad range of markets. Xilinx also announced a cash dividend of $0.31 per share. For the coming quarter, Xilinx expects revenue to be roughly flat sequentially, and gross margin should also be in the same ballpark of 68% to 69%.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Apr 27. Last quarter, the company had posted in-line earnings. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The California-based chipmaker reported modest results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. However, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were unfavorable, primarily due to lower revenues from the Communications & Data Center division, and the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense end-markets. Nonetheless, the fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance is encouraging.On the flip side, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment should remain the growth drivers. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues. Additionally, we are encouraged by Xilinx's endeavor to return shareholder value through regular share buybacks and dividend payouts.However, a delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities could dent the company's near-term results. Also, competition from the likes of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. The Earnings ESP for Xilinx is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 52 cents. Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #4.

"n Jan. 28, FPGA maker  issued a press release indicating that it had begun shipment of its first high-end FPGAs built on  's 16-nanometer FinFET+ manufacturing process. Xilinx, it said, is now shipping these products (presumably for revenue).It would appear that Xilinx has now beaten its archrival, Altera (recently acquired by  ), to commercial shipments of 14/16-nanometer class FPGAs. Here's why this is a significant positive for Xilinx and likely a major negative for Intel/Altera. On Intel's second-quarter  last year, CEO Brian Krzanich told investors that ""history tells us that the FPGA vendor who is first to a manufacturing process node enjoys a market segment share advantage over the life of that node.""In this case, we have Xilinx telling its investors that it is now shipping (presumably for revenue) product built on 16-nanometer FinFET+. This comes not too long after Xilinx made sure to let investors know that it began sampling these chips back in September.On the other hand, Altera, by way of Intel, hasn't said much to investors about its upcoming 14-nanometer FPGA. Altera/Intel put out a press release back in June detailing some of the architectural innovations that the product will bring and said in that release that ""engineering samples"" of the FPGA in the fall, but there was no follow-up release indicating that such sampling had begun.It's starting to look as though Xilinx will ""beat"" Altera to the 14/16-nanometer manufacturing technology node, which could mean market segment share loss for Altera/Intel and corresponding gain for Xilinx. Although it would appear that Xilinx is first to a 14/16-nanometer FPGA, it's worth noting that Intel maintains that its 14-nanometer technology is significantly denser, as well as more sophisticated, than competing foundry 14/16-nanometer offerings.That was before Intel acquired Altera, but once the latter went public that it would be manufacturing its next-generation high-end FPGA on Intel's 14-nanometer technology, this was a big selling point that Altera used to try to convince investors that it would indeed gain a sizable edge over Xilinx.I also wouldn't be surprised if Intel were, shall we say,  to have Altera go public with this announcement as a way to promote Intel Custom Foundry to potential customers and, more importantly, investors. I doubt that Intel will host a special event to go into the nitty-gritty of what it expects from the Altera business. However, it typically hosts yearly events when it launches next-generation server processors. This would be an opportune time for the company to also provide an update on its stand-alone FPGAs, particularly as these should become an increasingly important part of its overall data center portfolio over time.After this event, the next major opportunity for Intel to talk about the Altera business will be at its 2016 investor meeting, which will likely be held in November of this year. Management wasn't able to go into too much detail about the Altera business or any plans to develop integrated FPGA/server chips as the acquisition had not yet closed.With the deal now done, I fully expect the company to go into quite a bit of detail on both the plans for the stand-alone FPGA business as well as more comprehensive plans for integrated products later this year. After dropping more than $16 billion on Altera, Intel stockholders should expect nothing less.Cable is dying. And there are 3 stocks that are poised to explode when this faltering $2.2 trillion industry finally bites the dust. Just like newspaper publishers, telephone utilities, stockbrokers, record companies, bookstores, travel agencies, and big box retailers did when the Internet swept away their business models.

hares of  gained more than 8% during yesterday's after-hours trading session following its third-quarter fiscal 2016 results. While the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the bottom line matched the same. An impressive fourth-quarter outlook also contributed to the rally.Xilinx's third quarter revenues of $566.2 million declined 4.6% year over year. Nevertheless, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $554 million and improved 7.3% sequentially.The year-over-year decline resulted from dismal sales at two of its end-market divisions, namely Communications & Data Center division and Industrial, Aerospace & Defense. However, both the end markets improved on a sequential basis.Sales at Communications & Data Center division declined 3% year over year but increased 12% sequentially. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense division, on the other hand, decreased 10% year over year but gained 7% on a sequential basis. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive registered year-over-year growth of 7%, but a decline of 4% from the previous quarter.Geographically, revenues from North America went down 10% year over year, while that from Asia Pacific and Europe declined a respective 1% and 5%. Revenues from Japan remained flat with the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, revenues from North America, Asia Pacific and Japan grew 16%, 9% and 2%, respectively, while the same from Europe declined 6%.Product-wise, Xilinx's revenues from New products and Support increased 28% and 11%, respectively, while the same from Mainstream and Base products decreased a respective 17% and 30%. Sequentially, revenues from New products and Support increased 18% and 17%, respectively, while the same from Mainstream and Base products decreased a respective 3% and 1%.Xilinx reported 120 basis points (bps) contraction in gross margin (including stock-based compensation expenses but excluding other one-time items) on a year-over-year basis to 68.5% mainly because of customer mix shift to larger customers and higher ramp-up costs incurred due to aggressive product introductions.Adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% to $225.8 million, but remained below the company's expectations. As a percentage of revenues, the same went up 150 bps on a year-over-year basis to 39.9%.Xilinx's adjusted operating margin contracted 380 bps year over year to 29.1% mainly due to lower gross margin and higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales. In dollar terms, adjusted operating income decreased 15.6% to $164.5 million.The company's adjusted earnings came in at 49 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, it declined from the year-ago quarter figure of 62 cents.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $3.6 billion compared with $3.29 billion in the previous quarter. The company has total long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of about $1.6 billion comprising $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt.During the quarter, Xilinx generated $290.3 million cash from operations and incurred $6.1 million in capital expenditures. The company paid $79.7 million in cash dividends and repurchased $100 million shares.Management provided an encouraging fourth-quarter outlook. The company expects revenues to be flat sequentially at $566 million, which is very close to the Zacks Consensus Estimate $568 million.Gross margin is forecast to be between 68% and 69%. Operating expenses are likely to be around $220 million, which includes approximately $1 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Share count is expected to be roughly 267 million, while effective tax rate is projected in the range of 13% to 14%.The California-based chipmaker reported modest third-quarter fiscal 2016 results. However, year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were unfavorable, primarily due to lower revenues from Communications & Data Center division and Industrial, Aerospace & Defense end markets. Nonetheless, fourth-quarter revenue guidance was encouraging.Moreover, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company's product launches should boost revenues.Nonetheless, slowdown in the Chinese economy, along with economic weaknesses in Europe and Asia-Pacific could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  remains a headwind.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A couple of stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector are Diodes Incorporated  and Integrated Device Technology, Inc.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors eyeing a purchase of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $42.19/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $33 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.61. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.9% return against the $33 commitment, or a 4.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to XLNX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $33 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Xilinx, Inc. sees its shares decline 21.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $31.39 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.61 from $33), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.9% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 4.9% figure actually exceeds the 2.9% annualized dividend paid by Xilinx, Inc. by 2%, based on the current share price of $42.19. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 21.73% to reach the $33 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $33 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $33 strike for the 4.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

 is set to report third quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jan 20. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.35%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx reported modest second quarter fiscal 2016 results. However, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were unfavorable, primarily due to lower revenues from end markets and from geographical regions.Nonetheless, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company's product launches are expected to boost revenues.Additionally, we are encouraged by Xilinx's endeavor to return shareholder value through regular share buybacks and dividend payouts.However, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's near-term results. Also, competition from the likes of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Xilinx is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 48 cents. Xilinx's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:MicroStrategy Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.46% and a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy)CA, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.64% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" , the largest mobile chipmaker in the world, recently formed a new joint venture in China with the Guizhou Province government. The new company, Guizhou Huaxintong Semiconductor Technology, will design, develop, and manufacture chipsets for servers. Qualcomm will provide research support and server chip technology licenses to the joint venture.Guizhou, China. Source: Pixabay.The company will launch with an initial investment of 1.85 billion RMB ($280 million), and be 55% owned by the Chinese government, and 45% owned by Qualcomm. In a press release, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle stated that, although Qualcomm had worked with its Chinese partners for more than two decades, the joint venture ""represents a significant increase in our collaboration in China.""This move could help  , which provides the chip designs on which Qualcomm's data centers are based, and harm  , which has faced multiple challenges in the Chinese data-center market. Let's take a closer look at Qualcomm's data-center ambitions, and how it could turn China into the next big battleground for server chip dominance. Qualcomm has lost market share in mobile application processors and wireless modems to low-end rivals like  over the past year . Several major smartphone makers also decided to develop their own ARM-based CPUs instead of buying Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors. That market shift caused Qualcomm's chipmaking (QCT) revenues and pre-tax earnings to fall 8% and 35% in fiscal 2015, respectively.To diversify away from mobile devices, Qualcomm expanded  with chips for connected cameras, cars, drones, and Internet of Things devices. Another potential area of growth is the data-center market, which Intel dominates with its x86 Xeon chips.Last October, Qualcomm started sampling its first data-center chips, which use 24-core Qualcomm CPUs with custom ARM cores, to tier-1 data centers. Qualcomm claims that these chips ""will be competitive in performance and price"" against Intel's Xeons. In 2014, ARM said that its chip designs could claim 10% of the data-center market from Intel by 2017.Qualcomm paired its data-center CPUs with  's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate workloads. Unlike traditional processors, FPGAs  , which makes them popular among industries that need chips for custom tasks. This partnership directly counters Intel's acquisition of FPGA-maker Altera. Intel's Xeon chips still power most Chinese servers, but the government has grown wary of American tech ever since the Snowden leaks revealed NSA back doors in hardware and software. In response, China has accelerated its efforts to grow homegrown CPUs like  's Loongson chips. These chips are still much-less powerful than Intel's Xeons, but they could catch up within the next decade .To make matters worse, the U.S. blocked more than  of Intel Xeons to China last year. The U.S. claimed that those sales, which were intended for China's most-powerful supercomputers, would be ""contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests"" of the United States. This pressure from both sides has created an opening for Qualcomm and ARM to enter the market.China's Tianhe-2 supercomputer. Source: Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.Intel recently unveiled a $100 million ""strategic collaboration"" with  to protect its data-center market in China. Through the collaboration, Intel will add a new computer-processor module, which would run alongside its Xeons in Chinese data centers. The reconfigurable module, designed by Tsinghua, would ""add capabilities that address specific local requirements"" -- meaning that it's likely designed to address China's national security concerns. Last quarter, Intel's data center only rose 5% annually, to $4.3 billion, slowing down dramatically from 12% growth in the third quarter. For the full year, data-center revenue rose 11%, but Intel previously expected a compound annual growth rate of 15% for the business through 2018. That big miss caused Intel stock to fall nearly 10% the day after its earnings report.Intel relies on sales growth in its data center, Internet of Things, and memory businesses to offset concerns about its Client Computing (PC and mobile) division, which posted a 1% annual sales decline last quarter. But looking ahead, sales of its data-center chips could remain sluggish as ambitious new challengers enter the market. While Qualcomm is unlikely to conquer the data-center market anytime soon, its growth could still hurt Intel in crucial markets like China.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Friday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.24), with the stock changing hands as low as $40.44 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XLNX makes up 3.01% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading lower by about 4.5% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@XLNX Crosses Above 3% Yield Territory@2016-01-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xlnx-crosses-above-3-yield-territory-2016-01-15

" supplier of semiconductor components to defense, aerospace, industrial and communications markets,  has entered into a partnership with Intrinsic-ID, a provider of cyber physical security solutions based on physically unclonable functions (PUFs) to develop a secure boot solution for mission critical electronic systems.The solution, basically intended for electronic systems in government, aerospace and defense applications, is a new way to create a comprehensive secure boot process, from silicon to the system level.It provides users with control and protection over provisioning at each start-up of sensitive boot code into programmable components such as Altera & Xilinx  field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and system-on-chips (SoCs).These elements are frequently used for mission critical applications in military and aerospace, data centers and cloud computing, and need maximum security. Providing protection to a system comprising several components such as FPGAs and microprocessors is a complex process.Therefore, the combination of Microsemi FPGAs and secure authentication protocols through the use of PUF technology offers full system reliability and privacy protection for safely booting a complex electronic system.Microsemi has built a safe boot protocol for protecting third-party FPGA logic from being cloned, reverse engineered or fiddled with. The company has released the low power consuming, small-footprint flash-based SmartFusion 2 SoC FPGA, which works as a secure boot manager. SmartFusion2 first carries out its own integrated secure boot and then, working as a root-of-trust, controls the added large FPGAs and SoCs within the system with their secure boot.Sensitive encrypted bitstream or object code is sent through the SmartFusion2 FPGA to the target FPGAs or SoCs only after successful recognition of the target device and verification of its initial boot code through the use of the Intrinsic-ID PUF. The sensitive code is verified and decrypted on the target device.The kind of PUF used on the target FPGA is called a ""butterfly PUF"" which is a soft PUF. It can be integrated in any FPGA design and comprises a range of circuits, each including two cross-coupled memory elements that have a bi-stable output behavior.Microsemi's secure boot solution for FPGA/SoCs along with the soft PUF is available now.Microsemi is a global provider of advanced timing and synchronization solutions and has a comprehensive portfolio of precise time and frequency products. The company consistently introduces new and improved products that have enabled it to secure customer loyalty and boosted revenues. The new products will help in boosting its market share and thereby revenues.Microsemi currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks include NVIDIA Corporation  and Texas Instruments Inc.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

hares of  attained a new 52-week high of $49.88 yesterday, eventually closing at $49.69. The company gained 10.2% share price following the better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2016 bottom-line results reported on Oct 14.The California-based chipmaker reported earnings of 48 cents per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. Notably, Xilinx delivered positive earnings surprises in the preceding four quarters with an average beat of 6.86%. Moreover, the company issued encouraging outlook for the third quarter.The company has been witnessing growth at its 28-nm products which, it believes, will remain a key growth driver over the long run. The company now has a broad array of 28-nm PLD chips including products like Virtex-7, Kintex-7, Artix-7 and Zynq-7000.It should be noted that Xilinx garnered more than $580 million in revenues from the 28-nm products in fiscal 2015 as against $380 million in fiscal 2014. Additionally, the company expects the figure to increase through fiscal 2016 backed by steady demand and communications, and continued strong adoption in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense markets.Moreover, design wins from other sectors such as wired communication, data center and industrial will add to the revenues. While the scramble for shares at advanced nodes continues, strength at the legacy nodes offers near-term support to the business.Further, we believe that the company's continued focus on margin expansion, cost reduction across its product portfolio and higher yield are the positives. We also believe that Xilinx's product launches will boost revenues.Additionally, we are encouraged by Xilinx's endeavor to return shareholder value through regular share buybacks and dividend payouts. During the last reported quarter, the company repurchased $100 million shares and paid dividends of approximately $80 million. These initiatives not only boost earnings but also instill investor confidence and loyalty.Nonetheless, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Altera Corp.  is a headwind.Currently, Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology industry are CEVA Inc.  and Mellanox Technologies Ltd.  .

"nvestors in Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) saw new options become available today, for the January 2016 expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLNX options chain for the new January 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $46.00 strike price has a current bid of 89 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $46.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.11 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLNX, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $48.89/share today.Because the $46.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of XLNX stock at the current price level of $48.89/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $54.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.39% if the stock gets called away at the January 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if XLNX shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

"arlier this year,  agreed to buy  for almost $17 billion. That purchase will enhance Intel's data center chips with Altera's field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs ). On their own, FPGA chips are weaker than Intel's x86 chips, but they can be reprogrammed after manufacture to customize them for use in a wide range of devices such as connected cars, smart appliances, and even airplanes.Intel's purchase of Altera immediately cast a spotlight on  , the only other major maker of FPGAs, as a potential partner or takeover target for rival chipmakers. To counter Intel's acquisition of Altera,  and  both recently signed deals with Xilinx. Qualcomm's upcoming  -based server chips and IBM's Power-based ones will both use Xilinx's FPGAs to accelerate their performance.Xilinx's ZYNQ processors in connected cars. Source: Xilinx.Does the interest from Qualcomm and IBM in Xilinx indicate that the FPGA maker is a good long-term investment? To find out, let's compare Xilinx's business to Altera's, discuss its fundamental growth, and understand the impact of its deals with Qualcomm and IBM. Xilinx controls 50% of the FPGA market while Altera controls 39%, according to Morningstar. That's why Xilinx generated 23% more revenue than Altera last year.Last quarter, Altera's revenue fell 20% annually to $399.6 million, missing estimates by $29.4 million. Net income declined 48% to $61.5 million, or $0.20 per share, which also missed expectations by $0.10 a share. Altera blamed those declines on ""choppy conditions"" across multiple markets. It noted that while telecom, wireless networking, computer, storage, and data center sales rose sequentially, sales in the industrial automation, military, and connected auto markets declined. That weakness translated to a 21% year-over-year decline in FPGA revenue and a 5% decline in complex programmable logic device (CPLD ) revenue.Xilinx's revenue slipped 13% annually to $527.6 million last quarter, which also missed expectations by $2 million. Net income fell 26% to $127 million, or $0.48 per share, which beat estimates by a penny. Xilinx struggled with the same market conditions as Altera -- robust demand in wired and wireless communications was offset by declines across the industrial, aerospace, and defense markets. However, Xilinx finished the quarter with a gross margin of 70%, compared to Altera's 66.5%.Altera didn't offer any forward guidance due to its upcoming acquisition by Intel. Meanwhile, Xilinx said it expects its third quarter revenue will rise 3% to 7% sequentially to $543.4 million to $564.5 million, which is in line with the consensus estimate of $548.3 million. Qualcomm and IBM both want to challenge Intel in the data center market. That's a tough task, since Intel controls 99% of that market with its Xeon chips, which will be augmented with Altera's FPGAs.Intel-powered servers. Source: Intel.Qualcomm claims that its ARM-licensed data center chips, which use a 24-core Qualcomm CPU with custom ARM cores, ""will be competitive in performance and price"" with Intel's. That's a bold claim, since ARM server chips have mostly been used in low-end ""  "" that are purchased in clusters. Nonetheless,Qualcomm asserted last May that its designs could claim 10% of the data center market by 2017.IBM, which sold its Intel-powered server business to  last year, still sells high-end servers and mainframes that run on its Power processors. IBM is trying to gain ground against Intel in data centers by ""open sourcing"" its Power-based designs to third-party server vendors through its Open Power program. Xilinx's FPGAs will be paired with those designs.Both Qualcomm and IBM have ambitious goals, but it will be hard for either company to loosen Intel's grip on the data center market. Therefore, the overall impact of their plans on Xilinx's revenues should be minimal -- until or unless one or both gains some ground on Intel. Xilinx, as mentioned before, has experienced choppy growth this year, but demand for FPGAs is still expected to rise. Research firm Markets and Markets expects the overall FPGA market to grow at a compound annual rate of 8.1% between 2014 and 2020 to a value of $8.5 billion.Xilinx currently trades at 23 times earnings, which is considerably cheaper than the average P/E of 27 for the semiconductor/integrated circuits industry. It also pays a decent forward annual dividend yield of 2.5%. Looking ahead, it's likely that other chipmakers could sign new partnerships with Xilinx or make buyout offers to challenge Intel. Therefore, it might make sense to buy some shares of Xilinx today, even though the stock is near a 52-week high.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

" used to sell  -powered low to mid-range servers. But last year, IBM sold that unit to  to focus on selling high-end servers and mainframes powered by its own Power processors instead.Since then, IBM has positioned its remaining data center businesses directly against Intel, which holds a formidable 99% market share in server chips. In July, it announced the creation of a 7nm chip, which  Intel's plans to launch 10nm chips in 2017. It also expanded its ""  "" initiative, which shares processor specs, firmware, and software with partners to fuel the third-party production of Power-based servers.Source: Intel.That's why it wasn't surprising when IBM recently partnered with  , a maker of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), to counter Intel's acquisition of FPGA maker  . FPGAs are less powerful than IBM's or Intel's server chips, but they can be reprogrammed, making them well-suited for custom uses in connected cars, consumer devices, and airplanes. IBM and Intel are both using FPGAs to complement their server chips by accelerating workloads. IBM's revenue has fallen for 14 consecutive quarters, due to sluggish demand for its core IT services, software, and hardware. Big Blue wants investors to focus on the growth of its ""strategic imperatives"" -- cloud, analytics, mobile, social, and security -- which posted 17% annual sales growth last quarter, or 27% on a constant-currency basis excluding its divested System x (Intel-powered server) business. That growth was solid, but it wasn't enough to offset the steep declines in its other aging businesses.Last quarter, IBM's hardware revenues plunged 39% annually and accounted for less than 8% of its top line. Power Systems revenues slipped 3% and system storage revenues fell 19%, but z Systems mainframe revenues rose 15%. The decline in Power Systems revenue was expected, due to Intel's dominance of the data center market. But the growth in mainframes was surprising, since analysts had predicted the death of fridge-sized mainframes for decades.With Open Power, IBM hopes to gain market share against Intel by selling processors to third-party server vendors. In addition to boosting sales of Power CPUs, customers who buy that hardware might be more inclined to buy additional services from IBM's strategic imperatives portfolio. IBM's growing list of backers already includes  , Chinese vendors Inspur, NeuCloud, and Chuanghe, and Taiwanese company Tyan. Intel relies heavily on its data center revenues, which rose 12% annually and accounted for 29% of its top line last quarter, to offset declines in its PC and mobile chip businesses. That's why it recently made two big moves to widen its defensive moat against IBM.In October, it  , a start-up which develops a ""cognitive computing"" platform similar to IBM's Watson. Like Watson, Saffron processes huge amounts of data to generate business insights for clients. By combining Saffron with its own server chips and Altera's FPGAs, Intel can offer companies an all-in-one data center solution which cuts Big Blue out of the loop.That same month, it  to sell Oracle servers powered by Intel chips to enterprise customers. During a presentation, Oracle CEO Mark Hurd boldly claimed that the new Oracle-Intel architecture will offer faster performance than IBM's systems at a fraction of the cost. Oracle will also push its database and software customers to replace their IBM servers with Oracle-Intel ones instead. As Intel shores up its defenses against IBM, it should also keep an eye on  , which recently started testing its  in tier-1 data centers. Last year, ARM claimed that its designs could claim 10% of the server chip market by 2017.Qualcomm claims that these new chips, which use a 24-core Qualcomm GPU with custom ARM cores, ""will be competitive in performance and price"" with Intel's Xeons. Like IBM, Qualcomm is also pairing its server CPUs with Xilinx's FPGAs for workload acceleration. IBM, Xilinx, and Qualcomm don't represent immediate threats to Intel's data center business yet. But over time, IBM's Open Power partners could gain ground in the high-end market as Qualcomm turns heads in the low-end market. If Intel falls behind in this arms race of FPGAs, AI platforms, and other features, it could start losing market share at both ends of the market to these hungry underdogs.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

he Internet of Things (IoT) -- which includes connected devices like wearables, smart appliances, and connected cars -- is widely expected to become the next major growth market for the tech industry. Research firm IDC estimates that the global IoT market will grow from $656 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020.Source: Pixabay.That's why big chipmakers like  (NASDAQ: INTC) and  (NASDAQ: QCOM) are aggressively expanding into the IoT market. Intel, the largest PC and data-center chipmaker in the world, is using it to diversify away from its sluggish PC and mobile chip businesses. Qualcomm, the world's top mobile chipmaker, is expanding into IoT to diversify away from the saturated smartphone and tablet markets. As a result, the two tech giants are now clashing on multiple fronts across the IoT market. Let's take a closer look at both companies' core IoT strengths to see if either can triumph over the other. Qualcomm controls over half of the smartphone application processor market and about 60% of the LTE baseband market, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, and hopes to use those established markets as a launchpad for its IoT efforts.Last year, 120 million smart- home devices, 20 million cars, and 20 types of wearable devices were all powered by Qualcomm chips. To expand that reach, Qualcomm acquired CSR, an electronics company that specializes in Bluetooth, wireless, and automotive infotainment services, for $2.5 billion earlier this year. It also established the AllSeen Alliance, an IoT consortium that uses its open source AllJoyn framework as a communications standard for IoT devices. The AllSeen Alliance currently has over 160 members. To tether more start-ups to that growing ecosystem, Qualcomm launched the Qualcomm Robotics Accelerator, which provides resources to start-ups specializing in robotics and IoT technologies.Qualcomm also recently  with  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , the largest maker of FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) in the world, to use itsfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs ) to accelerate workloads in its new data-center chips.On their own, FPGA chips are weaker than traditional CPUs, but they can be reprogrammed for a wide variety of tasks in connected cars, factory automation, and more. Therefore, it's possible that Qualcomm might expand its partnership with Xilinx to reach additional IoT markets.Qualcomm doesn't break out its IoT revenues on a quarterly basis. However, it claims that it generated $1 billion in revenues last year by selling IoT chips for city infrastructure projects, home appliances, connected cars, and wearables. That $1 billion amounts to less than 4% of Qualcomm's 2014 revenue, but it still represents a promising start. Looking ahead, Qualcomm intends to expand its IoT business with SoCs (system on a chip) for  .Qualcomm's Snapdragon Cargo. Source: Qualcomm. Intel's x86 chips still power the vast majority of PCs and servers worldwide, but it lost the mobile market to Qualcomm and other chipmakers that licensed  's low-power chip designs. Intel doesn't plan to lose the IoT market in the same way. That's why it's expanding into the IoT with low-power Atom and Quark processors, and tiny computing modules like Edison and Curie, which can be installed in a wide range of connected devices like wearables, smart appliances, and cars. It's also expanding that  by combining its processors with 3D-sensing RealSense cameras.Intel leads a group of companies known as the Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC), which is establishing an open IoT communication standard based on its IoTivity framework. This alliance only has about half as many members as Qualcomm's AllSeen Alliance, but it has considerable strength in China. Intel's pending acquisition of  (NASDAQ: ALTR) , the second-largest maker of FPGAs in the world after Xilinx, will give it in-house access to hardware that should accelerate the performance of its data-center chips and possibly enhance its IoT chips and modules in the future.Intel's Edison. Source: Intel.Unlike Qualcomm, Intel reports IoT revenues on a quarterly basis. Last quarter, its IoT revenues rose 10% annually to $581 million and accounted for 4% of its top line. To broaden the division's reach, Intel recently created a new client and IoT business and systems architecture group that combines the platform engineering, client computing, IoT, software and services, and design and technology groups. It also hired Venkata Renduchintala, the former co-president of Qualcomm's main chip unit, to lead the new group. Qualcomm and Intel are both making solid progress in the IoT market, and it's impossible to predict which chipmaker will create the bigger ecosystem until the market matures. For now, investors should expect the two chipmakers to keep clashing with competing communication standards and chip designsin fledgling markets like connected cars, drones, and smart homes . But as long as both companies stay invested in the IoT market, sales of IoT chips should gradually start accounting for bigger chunks of their top-line growth.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

However, year-over-year comparisons on both the count were unfavorable, primarily due to lower revenues from end markets and from geographical regions. Nonetheless, third-quarter revenue guidance was encouraging.Moreover, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company's product launches are expected to boost revenues.Nonetheless, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's near-term results.

 is expected to report third-quarter 2015 results on Oct 28. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.03%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.NXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company, is known for its automotive and chip identification business and has seen massive growth in the portable device segment over the past one year. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter as well.Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables boosted the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them. These factors are likely to drive NXP Semiconductors' third-quarter revenues.However, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are likely to hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that NXP Semiconductors will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP for NXP Semiconductors is -2.22%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.32 per share is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate $1.35. NXP Semiconductors carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boyd Gaming Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank #1.Fiserv Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2016 results on Oct 14. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx reported mixed first-quarter fiscal 2016 results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Also, year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were unfavorable. Revenues declined primarily due to dismal sales at its Communications & Data Center division.We remain cautious of the company's near-term prospects due to persistent weakness in the wireless communication market. The weakness is primarily the result of a decline in capital spending by enterprises.Moreover, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Altera Corp.  remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Xilinx is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 46 cents. Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

 reported decent results for second-quarter 2015 wherein the top line and the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined year over year.Altera's second-quarter adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents but plunged 34.1% year over year. On a GAAP basis, the reported earnings of 23 cents per share declined from 41 cents posted a year ago mainly due to lower revenue base and higher operating expenses.Altera's second-quarter revenues decreased 15.7% on a year-over-year basis to $414.2 million. The decline was mainly due to weak performance by the telecom and wireless business resulting from capital spending delays across some of the developed and developing countries.In terms of product category, New Product revenues (53% of second-quarter total revenue) declined 14% year over year, while Mainstream (23%) and Mature and Other markets (24%) revenues went down 11% and 22%, respectively.On a year-over-year basis, revenues from FPGA (83% of second-quarter total revenue) decreased 17%, revenues from CPLD (11%) increased 11% year over year and the same from. Other product (6%) declined 31%.By verticals, Telecom & Wireless (31%) decreased 44% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, Industrial Automation and Military & Automotive markets revenues (27%) increased 10% year over year, Networking, Computer & Storage (18%) increased 4%, while Other segment revenues (24%) went up 11% from second-quarter 2014.By geography, revenues from the Americas region increased 6% on a year-over-year basis, whereas the same from the EMEA, Asia Pacific and Japan regions decreased 18%, 17% and 28%, respectively.Altera reported gross margin of 69.4%, up 240 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter primarily backed by better product mix.Total operating expenses were up 10.2% from the year-ago quarter to $201.2 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased to 48.6% from 37.1% in the year-ago quarter.This, in turn, negatively impacted Altera's quarterly operating margin, which came in at 20.8%, down 900 bps year over year from 29.8%. Reported net income was $70.3 million compared with $127 million a year ago.Altera exited the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.07 billion, lower than the previous-quarter level of $2.38 billion. Long-term debt amounted to $1.49 billion, flat sequentially. During the first six months of 2015, the company generated cash flow from operating activities of $225.9 million compared with $301.4 million in the comparable year-ago period.Furthermore, concurrent with its earnings release, Altera announced a cash dividend of 18 cents to be paid on Sep 1, 2015 to shareholders of record as on Aug 10.Altera's results for second-quarter 2015 were better than expected but declined year over year. The decline was mainly due to weak performance by the company's telecom and wireless business resulting from capital equipment delays from carriers in developed as well as some developing countries.Nonetheless, growth in 3G and 4G/LTE deployments, in particular, will increase the demand for FPGAs, which will be beneficial for Altera. Additionally, the company's transition to 14-nanometer (nm) FPGAs in association with Intel Corp.  is likely to be a competitive differentiator.Altera is currently manufacturing its chips using 28-nm nodes. We believe that the deployment will strengthen its product portfolio and offer more comprehensive and high-value programmable solutions.Moreover, the continued share buybacks should support the bottom line, going forward.However, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  , consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are the concerns.Currently, Altera has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The decline resulted from the dismal sales at its Communications & Data Center division.Sales at  division declined 36% year over year.  and  divisions, however, registered year-over-year growth of 2% and 27%, respectively.Geographically, revenues from North America were up 18% year over year, while that from Asia Pacific, Europe and Japan declined a respective 24%, 19% and 5%.

However, as a percentage of revenues, the same went up 300 bps on a year-over-year basis to 38%.Xilinx's adjusted operating margins contracted 130 bps year over year to 33.3% mainly due to higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, which more than offsets the positive impact of gross margin improvement. In dollar terms, adjusted operating income decreased 13.6% to $182.8 million.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term investments of $3.33 billion compared with $3.30 billion in the previous quarter.

During the quarter, Xilinx generated $183 million cash from operations and incurred $8 million in capital expenditures.

Also, second-quarter revenue guidance was disappointing.We remain cautious of the company's near-term prospects due to persistent weakness in the wireless communication market. The weakness is primarily the result of decline in capital spending by enterprises.Moreover, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Altera Corp.  remains a headwind.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Investors may consider better-ranked stocks such as Avago Technologies Ltd.  and eMagin Corp.  carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Wednesday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.24), with the stock changing hands as low as $40.62 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XLNX makes up 2.69% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading lower by about 2.5% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@XLNX Crosses Above 3% Yield Territory@2015-07-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xlnx-crosses-above-3-yield-territory-2015-07-22

 is set to report first-quarter 2016 results on Jul 22. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 16%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx reported mixed fourth-quarter results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed. Also, the company saw a year-over-year decline in revenues mainly due to dismal sales at its communications and other divisions.However, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes, driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment, are expected to remain growth drivers. The company's product launches are expected to boost revenues.Nonetheless, delays in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative activitiescould impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Altera Corp.  remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Xilinx is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 53 cents. Xilinx carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apple Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.78% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Amazon.com Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"arrizo APU. Source: AMD via Facebook. Shares of  , better known as AMD, fell by $0.02, or less than 1%, in Tuesday's trading session, closing at $2.29. This was despite receiving a very bullish rating initiation from one Wall Street firm, which believes AMD's shares could more than double. Gus Richard, the covering analyst at Northland Capital, initiated coverage on AMD yesterday with an ""outperform"" rating (the equivalent of a ""buy"") and a price target of $5 per share. If AMD were to hit Richard's target, it would deliver a 118% return to shareholders.Richard's bullish thesis amid a sea of skepticism surrounding AMD involves the expected growth of data centers and the reliance on x86-compatible chips. The only two companies that supply chips in this realm are chip-making powerhouse  and AMD. Because Richards believes that rewriting the software that's the backbone of today's data centers would take a lot of time and effort, he contends that x86 will ""continue to dominate the server market.""Richard also believes that even if x86 loses its grasp in data centers in the U.S., AMD could be an attractive takeover target. Richard cites a number of possible suitors in his note to investors, including  , Intel, and potentially a China-based company since China is heavily dependent on x86 processors.Richard estimates that AMD could have about 10% market share in data center processors by 2017 (or about $1 billion in sales), which should lead to gross margin expansion and EPS of $0.50 for the full year.Source: AMD via Facebook. The real question that investors need to ask here is whether you trust Northland Capital's assessment or believe AMD is a dead duck.On a fundamental basis it's tough to argue against the dead duck theory. AMD is in the midst of a multi-year businesses turnaround that continues to be pushed out by a weakening PC market and the heavy spending required to enter highly competitive next-generation product markets, such as the cloud, gaming, and data centers. Wall Street projects that AMD will lose money on an annual basis until 2017. However, unlike Richard's $0.50 EPS estimate for the full-year, Wall Street's consensus is a mere $0.03 profit.However, playing second fiddle to Intel can have its perks, too. Even maintaining 10%-15% market share in data centers could net AMD substantial growth in the coming decade. Additionally, AMD has a growing presence in gaming consoles and has made significant headway in gaining microserver market share.Personally, I've been weighing an investment in AMD for some time now, and I'm liking its potential for a turnaround. I would suggest that only those with a high tolerance for risk even consider investing in AMD, since it does have a number of competitive challenges yet to overcome. However, with new management in place and AMD targeting higher growth prospects, I suspect it's only a matter of time before the company puts its struggles firmly in the rearview mirror.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

n Jun 9, 2015, Zacks  downgraded  to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #5 are likely to underperform the broader market.Most of the estimates for the company have been moving downward since the company reported lower-than-expected first-quarter 2015 results on Apr 23. Also, a soft second quarter 2015 revenue guidance remains an overhang on the stock.Altera's first-quarter earnings of 31 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and declined 16.2% year over year. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to a lower revenue base resulting from weak performance by the telecom and wireless business, which was partially offset by a lower tax rate and share count.Altera's first-quarter revenues also decreased 5.6% on a year-over-year basis to $435.5 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $471 million. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to a struggling telecom and wireless business as a result of capital equipment delays from carriers in China, Japan, the U.S., and some developing countries. Soft performance by the Industrial Automation, Military & Automotive segment also contributed to the decline.The company exited the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.38 billion, lower than the previous quarter level of $2.58 billion. Long-term debt stood at $1.49 billion.Considering the current weakness at telecom and wireless division, Altera has issued a soft second-quarter guidance. The company expects second-quarter 2015 sales to decline 4% to 8% sequentially. In dollar terms, it translates to a range of $400 to $418 million (mid-point $409 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $410 million.A lower-than-expected performance in first-quarter 2015 and a not-so-encouraging revenue outlook resulted in downward estimate revisions for Altera. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined 23.2% to $1.26 per share for 2015.Furthermore, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are concerns.Not all technology stocks are performing as poorly as Altera. We recommend Cirrus Logic Inc.  and VASCO Data Security International Inc.  , both of which sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Image source: Intel.So Intel potentially could have paid less for a more dominant programmable chip expert. Moreover, Xilinx is a better-run company with a higher operating margin and stronger returns on equity. In short, Xilinx seems to offer a better return on Intel's investment and a clearer path toward higher profits.But Xilinx doesn't have the history of partnering with Intel that Altera offers. The early groundwork has been laid for an intimate relationship, and Intel should know Altera's business like its own navel lint. That's an important value driver, and perhaps enough to give Altera the upper hand in Intel's eyes.Finally, it's entirely possible that Intel approached Xilinx with a buyout offer, but was rebuffed with a much higher price in mind. You've seen the difference between Altera's and Xilinx's programmable market shares, and Xilinx runs a tighter operational ship. Nevertheless, Altera's shares command higher valuation multiples, and not just amid Intel's rumored (and then actual) buyout interest: data by  .You can't blame Xilinx management for holding out for a bigger payoff.At the end of the day, I think Intel made a sensible choice here. Altera's expertise gives the chip giant new avenues into the Internet of Things and boosts Intel's already dominant data center business.Xilinx might have been an even better idea, but perhaps a much more expensive deal with a rougher merger integration road map. Sometimes, a compromise is the best available choice.That's what Intel is hoping for here, and for good reason.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... But you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions.""

"he deal that we have all been speculating on is finally done and we've come to know that the boards of both companies have approved. Altera shareholders are the only ones left to vote, but that's just a formality considering the way its shares have soared recently.The acquisition that is expected to close later this year will be immediately accretive.Altera  designs the field-programmable-gate-arrays (FPGAs) that are used in telecom and computer networks, cars and other products where they are suitably reconfigured to take workloads off the main compute system and thereby speed it up.Intel  , on the other hand, designs and makes the computing logic that processes the information in the system. Therefore, Intel's chips speed up when they are coupled with FPGAs, which is exactly what Chipzilla has been doing with its Xeon line for some time now.Intel has said in the past that its foundry partnerships would be strategic and that it wouldn't offer foundry services simply to keep its fabs full. And it hasn't really done anything to make us believe otherwise.Altera's FPGA volumes aren't likely to be colossal and yet Intel went to a lot of trouble to get Altera on board: Altera has exclusive access to Intel's 14nm tri-gate manufacturing technology for FPGAs (albeit for a limited time). It also has a 12-year product support commitment and last-time buy rights.Intel will also have to fork out a ton of cash if it decides to terminate the contract and is not allowed to buy any other FPGA company during this time - the immediate names that come to mind are Xilinx  and much smaller rival Lattice  . All this seems to indicate that Intel wants Altera for the long haul. : ""Intel's growth strategy is to expand our core assets into profitable, complementary market segments. With this acquisition, we will harness the power of Moore's Law to make the next generation of solutions not just better, but able to do more.""Whether to enable new growth in the network, large cloud data centers or IoT segments, our customers expect better performance at lower costs. This is the promise of Moore's Law and it's the innovation enabled by Intel and Altera joining forces. We look forward to working with the talented team at Altera to deliver this value to our customers and stockholders."" : ""We believe that as part of Intel we will be able to develop innovative FPGAs and system-on-chips for our customers in all market segments. Together, we expect to drive meaningful value for our customers, partners and employees around the world.""This is an exciting transaction that provides immediate and significant value to our stockholders. We look forward to working closely with the Intel team to ensure a smooth transition and complete the transaction as quickly as possible.""First, there is the ARM Holding  issue. Most chip companies dealing with consumer and communications markets are dependent on ARM technology and Altera is no different. Since ARM designs are in direct competition with Intel designs and in fact constitute one of the biggest challenges for Intel, it's hard to see Intel furthering its competitor's business. But this again could be part of the reason for the acquisition: Intel would surely like to replace ARM in mobile.Second, Altera being a fabless company remains totally dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company  . Transferring existing production to Intel's fabs won't be feasible cost-wise, so synergies could be a bit delayed.The consolidation in the semiconductor industry is significant and with the first half barely over, we have seen several billion dollars in deals. Just last week, Avago  announced its acquisition of Broadcom  for $37 billion. And we probably aren't done yet!Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 started 2015 on a dismal note as it reported lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings. In response, shares fell nearly 3% in after-hours trading. Additionally, a soft revenue outlook for the second quarter of 2015 hurt investors' sentiments.Altera's first-quarter earnings of 31 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and declined 16.2% year over year. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to lower revenue base resulting from weak performance by the telecom and wireless business which was partially offset by lower tax rate and share counts.Altera's first-quarter revenues decreased 5.6% on a year-over-year basis to $435.5 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $471 million. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to weak performance by the telecom and wireless business resulting from capital equipment delays from carriers in China, Japan, the U.S., and some developing countries. Soft performance by Industrial Automation, Military & Automotive segment also contributed to the decline.In terms of product category, the company witnessed a year-over-year growth of 15% in New Product revenues (59% of first-quarter total revenue), while Mainstream (19%) and Mature and Other markets (22%) revenues declined 20% and 29%, respectively. New product revenues were primarily driven by robust performance by the 28-nanometer (nm) process node.Revenues from FPGA (84% of first-quarter total revenue) decreased 4% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from CPLD constituted 8% of total revenue, which dropped 10% year over year. Other product revenues declined 14% and accounted for the remaining 8% of first quarter revenues.By verticals, Telecom & Wireless (42% of first-quarter revenues) decreased 12%, from the year-ago quarter. Industrial Automation and Military & Automotive markets revenues (21%) decreased 7% year over year. On the other hand, Networking, Computer & Storage (17%) increased 2% and the Other segment revenues (20%) increased 7% from the year-ago period.By geography, revenues from the Americas region increased 4% on a year-over-year basis, whereas the same from the EMEA, Asia Pacific and Japan regions decreased 3%, 1% and 32%, respectively.Altera reported gross margin of 64.1%, down 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter primarily due to lower revenue base.Total operating expenses were up nearly 1% from the year-ago quarter to $176.2 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 260 bps to 40.5% from 37.9% in the year-ago quarter.This, in turn, negatively impacted Altera's quarterly operating margin. The company's operating margin came at 23.7%, 550 bps lower than the prior-year period figure of 29.2%.Reported net income was $94.9 million or 31 cents per share compared with $116.5 million or 37 cents per share in the first quarter of 2014.Altera exited the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.38 billion, lower than the previous quarter level of $2.58 billion. Long-term debt amounted to $1.49 billion, flat with the previous quarter. The company generated cash flow from operating activities of $136.6 million in the reported quarter compared with $130.4 million in first-quarter 2014.During the quarter, Altera repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares for $57.5 million, Furthermore, concurrent with its earnings release, Altera announced a cash dividend of 18 cents to be paid on Jun 1, 2015 to shareholders of record as on May 11.Considering the current weakness at telecom and wireless division, Altera has issued soft second-quarter guidance. The company expects second-quarter 2015 sales to decline 4% to 8% sequentially. In dollar terms, it translates to a range of $400 to $418 million (mid-point $409 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $491 million. However, the company remains positive about its 28-nm performance for the forthcoming quarter.Management projects gross margin within the 66.5% to 67.5% range in the second quarter. Operating expenses are expected to be nearly $760 million.Altera has posted dismal first-quarter 2015 results wherein the top line and the bottom line missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and compared unfavorably year over year.The year-over-year decline was mainly due to weak performance by the company's telecom and wireless business resulting from capital equipment delays from carriers in China, Japan, the U.S., and some developing countries. Moreover, a soft performance at Industrial Automation, Military & Automotive segment contributed to the overall decline.Furthermore, the company provided tepid second-quarter 2015 revenue guidance apprehending lower-than-expected sales from the telecom and wireless segments.Nonetheless, growth in 3G and 4G/LTE deployments, in particular, will increase the demand for FPGAs, which will be beneficial for Altera. Additionally, the company's transition to 14-nm FPGAs in association with Intel Corp.  is likely to be a competitive differentiator.Altera is currently manufacturing its chips using 28-nm nodes. We believe that the deployment will strengthen its product portfolio and offer more comprehensive and high-value programmable solutions.Moreover, the continued share buybacks should support the bottom line, going forward.However, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc.  and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation  , consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are the concerns.Currently, Altera has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of analog and mixed signal integrated circuits (IC) maker,  spiked 4.9%, touching a high of $34.86, before closing a notch lower at $34.10, following reports that it is one of the potential acquisition targets of chipmaker Avago Technologies  .According to Reuters, Avago has narrowed down to at least three potential acquisition targets. The list includes San Jose - based semiconductor manufacturers: Xilinx  and Maxim, and Tokyo-based Renesas Electronics.Per reports, Avago, which seeks to diversify its business in areas ranging from analog semiconductors to radio frequency technology, is ready to pay more than $10 billion on a prospective buyout. The reports also reveal that Avago has approached private equity firm Silver Lake Partners for collaborating on a potential acquisition. However, as of now, Avago's apprehensions regarding higher prices have restricted merger talks.This is not the first time that Avago has expressed its interest in acquiring fellow chipmakers. Earlier this year, Avago made a bid for Freescale Semiconductor. However, fellow Apple  chip supplier NXP Semiconductors announced in March that it was acquiring Freescale for over $11.8 billion, which Avago believed was too expensive.Avago Technologies is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices and digital, mixed-signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems.Maxim, on the other hand, is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of semiconductor analog and mixed signal integrated circuits (ICs). The company has a broad product portfolio that includes analog-to-digital converters, amplifiers and comparators, communications devices, data converters and management components, sensors and wireless products.With Avago aspiring to expand its business, there's no doubt Maxim would be on the list of its potential buyout targets.The semiconductor industry is one of the best-performing spaces within the tech sector. These companies often form the backbone of the technology world and are part of an industry that posted sales of $340.3 billion in 2014, up 7.9% from $315.4 billion posted in 2013. The semiconductor industry was in fact one of the top performing industries in 2014.But things don't always go as expected. Analysts believe that the semiconductor business is maturing, which has created a need for larger companies. The flurry of mergers in the semiconductor space basically stems from deep growth issues as the decline in the personal computer industry restricts growth potential and the lower-margin mobile-device industry hampers profits. By merging with other established players, chip companies can capitalize on economies of scale, reduce costs and expand their footprint.As per Thomson Reuters data, global semiconductor M&A reached $31 billion in 2014, the maximum since 2011.All said and done, whether Maxim and Avago's talks will materialize into a deal and help them expand their collective market share remains to be seen.Maxim has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of  plunged nearly 3.5% in after-hour trading yesterday in response to the lower-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 revenues and a tepid first-quarter fiscal 2016 outlook.However, the company's adjusted earnings of 58 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents and marked 9.4% year-over-year improvement. The year-over-year increase in the bottom line were mainly attributable to improved margins resulting from better product and customer mix and lower operating expenses. Lower share count also benefited the company's earnings.On a GAAP-basis, earnings came at 50 cents per share compared with the year-ago quarter's earnings of 53 cents.Xilinx's fourth-quarter revenues of $566.9 million witnessed a year-over-year decline of 8.2% and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $577 million. The company's weak top line was mainly due to dismal sales at its communications and other divisions.Sales at  and  divisions declined a respective of 26% and 31% year over year.  and  divisions registered a year-over-year decline of 7%, 9% and 39%, respectively. However,  division's sales improved 13% and 6%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter.Geographically, revenues from North America were up 10% year over year, while that from Asia Pacific, Europe and Japan declined 20%, 9% and 5%, respectively. Product-wise, Xilinx's revenues from new products increased 5%, while the same from Mainstream, Base and Support products decreased 22%, 14% and 6%, respectively.Further, Xilinx's sales of 28-nm product family continue to grow. During the quarter, sales from 28-nm products crossed $160 million, which was above expectations.Xilinx reported 230 basis points (bps) gross margin expansion year on year to 69.9% mainly due to better product and customer mix.Operating expenses (excluding restructuring charges) went down 6.5% to $213.5 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, the same expanded 70 bps on a year-over-year basis to 37.7%.Xilinx's operating margins (excluding restructuring charges) expanded 160 bps year over year to 32.3% mainly due to increased gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses, as a percentage of sales. In dollar terms, operating income (excluding restructuring charges) decreased 3.4% to $183 million.Xilinx exited the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term investments of $3.30 billion compared with $2.92 billion in the previous quarter.

During the quarter, Xilinx generated $166 million of cash from operations and incurred $5.9 million in capital expenditures. The company paid $75.6 million in cash dividends and repurchased $175 million shares during the reported quarter.Management provided a tepid first-quarter fiscal 2016 outlook. The company expects revenues to decline in the range of 0 to 4% sequentially or within the $567 to $544 million range (mid-point $555 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $585 million.Gross margin is forecast to be between 69% and 70%. Operating expenses are expected to be around $210 million, which includes approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Share count is likely to be roughly 266 million and effective tax rate about 13% to 14%.Xilinx reported mixed fourth-quarter results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed. Also, first-quarter fiscal 2016 revenue guidance was disappointing.However, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company's product launches are expected to boost revenues.Nonetheless, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Altera Corp.  remains a headwind.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors may also consider better-ranked stocks such as Avago Technologies Ltd.  and Cirrus Logic Inc.  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Apr 22. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx reported mixed third-quarter results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Also, fourth-quarter revenue guidance was disappointing.However, increasing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain growth drivers. The company also expects a rebound in Industrial, Aerospace & Defense sales. The company's product launches are expected to boost revenues.Nonetheless, delay in China LTE deployments and higher research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Altera Corp. remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 50 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Xilinx's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Broadcom Corp.  , with an Earnings ESP of +5.00% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Apple Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.79% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Facebook, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"Chicago, IL - June 02, 2015 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .The deal that we have all been speculating on is finally done and we've come to know that the boards of both companies have approved. Altera shareholders are the only ones left to vote, but that's just a formality considering the way its shares have soared recently.The acquisition that is expected to close later this year will be immediately accretive.Altera (  ) designs the field-programmable-gate-arrays (FPGAs) that are used in telecom and computer networks, cars and other products where they are suitably reconfigured to take workloads off the main computer system and thereby speed it up.Intel (  ), on the other hand, designs and makes the computing logic that processes the information in the system. Therefore, Intel's chips speed up when they are coupled with FPGAs, which is exactly what Chipzilla has been doing with its Xeon line for some time now.Intel has said in the past that its foundry partnerships would be strategic and that it wouldn't offer foundry services simply to keep its fabs full. And it hasn't really done anything to make us believe otherwise.Altera's FPGA volumes aren't likely to be colossal and yet Intel went to a lot of trouble to get Altera on board: Altera has exclusive access to Intel's 14nm tri-gate manufacturing technology for FPGAs (albeit for a limited time). It also has a 12-year product support commitment and last-time buy rights.Intel will also have to fork out a ton of cash if it decides to terminate the contract and is not allowed to buy any other FPGA company during this time, such as Xilinx (  ). All this seems to indicate that Intel wants Altera for the long haul. : ""Intel's growth strategy is to expand our core assets into profitable, complementary market segments. With this acquisition, we will harness the power of Moore's Law to make the next generation of solutions not just better, but able to do more.""Whether to enable new growth in the network, large cloud data centers or IoT segments, our customers expect better performance at lower costs. This is the promise of Moore's Law and it's the innovation enabled by Intel and Altera joining forces. We look forward to working with the talented team at Altera to deliver this value to our customers and stockholders."" : ""We believe that as part of Intel we will be able to develop innovative FPGAs and system-on-chips for our customers in all market segments. Together, we expect to drive meaningful value for our customers, partners and employees around the world.""This is an exciting transaction that provides immediate and significant value to our stockholders. We look forward to working closely with the Intel team to ensure a smooth transition and complete the transaction as quickly as possible.""First, there is the ARM Holding (  ) issue. Most chip companies dealing with consumer and communications markets are dependent on ARM technology and Altera is no different. Since ARM designs are in direct competition with Intel designs and in fact constitute one of the biggest challenges for Intel, it's hard to see Intel furthering its competitor's business. But this again could be part of the reason for the acquisition: Intel would surely like to replace ARM in mobile.Second, Altera being a fabless company remains totally dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (  ). Transferring existing production to Intel's fabs won't be feasible cost-wise, so synergies could be a bit delayed.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

nvestors considering a purchase of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $44.26/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $33 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.59. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.8% return against the $33 commitment, or a 2.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to XLNX's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $33 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Xilinx, Inc. sees its shares decline 25.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $31.41 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.59 from $33), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Xilinx, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $33 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $33 strike for the 2.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Xilinx, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.26) to be 30%.

"Chicago, IL - April 01, 2015 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include the  (  -  ),  (  -  ),  (  -  ),  (  -  ) and  (  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .At the beginning of the month, Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors announced that it will be acquiring Freescale Semiconductor Holdings for $12 billion. The company's CEO Rick Clemmer said the acquisition will form ""a true powerhouse"" in the semiconductor sector, creating a $40 billion company. Speculations about Intel Corp.'s move to acquire Altera Corp. will pave the way for further consolidation in the semiconductor sector.Intel is apparently in advanced talks to buy Altera, which is a leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) maker. Altera already has an exclusive 14nm foundry agreement with Intel. The buyout could bring the companies closer both in terms of chip design and manufacturing process.Prior to the announcement, Altera had a market value of around $10.5 billion. This has increased substantially after the company's share price surged 28.4% last Friday. Meanwhile, Intel's cash balance last stood at $14.1 billion.This indicates that the veteran chipmaker is willing to go the extra mile and is prepared to raise funds from debt or equity to make the acquisition. Intel's largest acquisition til now has been McAfee, which it purchased in 2010 for $6.8 billion in cash terms. Even in this case, the amount represented only 37% of the company's cash reserves.The reason for Intel's eagerness is its need to protect its data center business while also running its chip fabrication plants at full capacity. The company still depends on personal computers for 60% of its revenues. This segment provides good cash flows and margins but cannot possibly grow further. In the short term, Altera's faster-growing top line will add a few percentage points of growth to Intel's.Consolidation touched a three-year peak in 2014 for the semiconductor sector. Total deal value stood at $19.5 billion. In volume terms, deals in 2015 have already outpaced past last year's M&A's. Some analysts believe at least 10% of semiconductor companies listed in the U.S. will be acquired in 2015.Economies of scale are a major consideration driving this spate of deals. This in turn stems from the need to reduce costs and improve capacity utilization. The other driving force is the desire to bump up sales to boost an industry achieving maturity.In fact, most chip majors share Intel's woes. The decline of the personal computer, which constitutes the major source of demand for these chipmakers, has hastened the move toward consolidation.Some analysts opine that companies as large as Broadcom Corp., with a market value of $26 billion, could draw attention from potential buyers. However, more likely targets are smaller companies, starting with those that are close to Altera's size.Xilinx Inc. (  -  ), whose market value of $11 billion is nearly identical to that of Altera's, is a prime takeover candidate. Among the company's possible suitors are the likes of IBM Corp. (  -  ) and QUALCOMM Inc. (  -  ). For both IBM and Qualcomm, acquiring an FPGA producer would make perfect sense.Atmel Corp. (  -  ) and Silicon Laboratories Inc. (  -  ) would make for even easier purchases. With market values well below $5 billion, their very size could emerge as a major problem in the current environment. Valued at around $3.5 billion, Atmel has growth woes and will gain substantially from an acquisition.Additionally, both Silicon Laboratories and Atmel can provide stable business while also presenting significant opportunities for cost reduction. Companies of this size and those that are even smaller need to evaluate their options carefully. In most cases, a strategic exit could be a prudent option.The stage is set for further consolidation in the semiconductor industry. However, it is premature to predict whether the sector will emerge stronger from this trend in 2015 itself. In the short term, potential targets could witness spikes of the kind experienced recently by Altera.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

After all, if the folks running the company think the stock is worth more than what Intel offered, then the shares might currently be undervalued relative to future prospects.However, while the management and directors have significant insight into future prospects, they do not have a crystal ball. Many companies have rejected offers that turned out to be quite generous in hindsight.That said, as of this writing, Altera shares are actually  from the closing price Thursday, which suggests investors seem to agree with the company -- Altera is worth more in the long run than what Intel offered.  If Intel was really willing to pony up north of $15 billion to acquire Altera, this would imply that Intel is serious about getting programmable logic devices into its product portfolio.In the field-programmable gate array market, Altera and  are the two major players. There are certainly some smaller FPGA vendors out there, but I think for what Intel would be interested in (bleeding-edge, high-performance FPGAs), acquiring Altera or Xilinx might have been the quickest way in.However, I cannot help but think about the two smaller FPGA vendors Intel had forged foundry deals with: Achronix and Tabula. Tabula  last month, but Achronix still seems to be around.One possibility for Intel, if it is really this set on selling FPGAs, is to acquire Achronix, and from that baseline, build up an FPGA effort. This would take a lot longer than buying one of the big fish like Altera or Xilinx, and Intel would effectively be in competition with both of these vendors.However, if Altera will not sell at a price Intel is willing to pay, and if Intel  wants in on FPGAs beyond a foundry deal, then this might be the best course of action. On a related note, Intel is currently the manufacturing partner for upcoming high-end Altera Stratix 10 FPGAs. These chips will be built on Intel 14-nanometer technology.What will be worth watching is what Altera does at the 10-nanometer technology generation. Paul McLellan, writing for  , pointed out a very interesting snippet from the most recent Altera  on that topic.In particular, the CEO said that Altera is expecting to make a decision as to which company will build its 10-nanometer FPGAs by the end of the first calendar quarter.The two companies in the running for this are Intel and  . And given that we are now past the end of the first quarter, I would not be surprised if Altera announced its build partners for its next generation of high-end, 10-nanometer FPGAs on the April 23rd .If Altera goes with Intel, then at the very least, Intel will continue to have exposure to high-end Altera FPGA sales. If the company goes with TSMC, then the situation could potentially get much trickier for Intel.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""... but you'll probably just call it ""how I made my millions.""

" juicy report from the  claims that  is in talks to buy FPGA maker  . No specifics on the deal, such as timing or final purchase price, were given in the report. Intel's shares closed up 6.38% following the  's report late last week, and Altera shares were up 28.39%. According to  's Stacy Rasgon, quoted in  , this rumored deal makes sense as there are ""synergies"" between Altera's FPGA business and Intel's data center business. In a nutshell, by having a leading FPGA vendor under the Intel banner, the latter company could grab more content share within the data center.Indeed, Intel has already announced that it plans to offer custom Xeon server processors with on-package FPGAs to accelerate certain workloads. Having Altera in-house could potentially allow for a broader product portfolio of Xeon-with-FPGA products. It could also make it tougher for competitors in both server processor  FPGA businesses to compete with Intel's tightly integrated CPU/FPGA solutions.Further, Intel and Altera have already been very public about a foundry relationship that exists between them for high-end FPGAs. If Intel acquired Altera, then it would make sense for Altera to transition  of its products to Intel manufacturing. This could potentially serve as a long-term competitive advantage for Altera relative to longtime rival  .For Intel, this could mean more leading-edge semiconductor business for its leading-edge factories, as well as a further diversified revenue base from its traditional PC business. Intel, taken as a whole, generates in the vicinity of $55 billion in annual revenue, so tacking on Altera's roughly $2 billion in annual revenue is nice -- but not a game changer. However, if we look at this rumored deal from the perspective of Intel's data-center business, it looks a lot more interesting.Intel's data-center group generated about $14.4 billion in revenue last year and about $7.3 billion in operating profit. If you add to that Altera's revenue of $1.93 billion last year, as well as its operating profit of $543 million, then this would mean an instant 13.4% boost in annual data-center revenue, and an increase of 7.44% in the segment's operating income.I'm sure that  such a deal is announced, both Intel and Altera will talk about the ""cost synergies"" that the two companies expect to eventually realize from the business combination. This might mean an even larger increase to operating profit for Intel over time from this deal. Intel executives have talked about how they want to expand their offerings to span much of the data center. Intel has already made a number of acquisitions to bolster its data-center group, including the Axxia networking processor assets from  , and network switches from its Fulcrum Microsystems acquisition.If Intel were to buy Altera, it would seem to me that it would have the most complete data-center portfolio out there (if it doesn't already). The ability to be a ""one stop shop"" for many companies' data-center needs could serve as an incredible competitive advantage. With a leading FPGA vendor under the Intel banner, it's hard to imagine that any other company today could successfully challenge Intel's data-center dominance.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it ""transformative""...

"t the beginning of the month, Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors  announced that it will be acquiring Freescale Semiconductor Holdings  for $12 billion. The company's CEO Rick Clemmer said the acquisition will form ""a true powerhouse"" in the semiconductor sector, creating a $40 billion company. Speculations about Intel Corp.'s  move to acquire Altera Corp.  will pave the way for further consolidation in the semiconductor sector.Intel is apparently in advanced talks to buy Altera, which is a leading field programmable gate array (FPGA) maker. Altera already has an exclusive 14nm foundry agreement with Intel. The buyout could bring the companies closer both in terms of chip design and manufacturing process.Prior to the announcement, Altera had a market value of around $10.5 billion. This has increased substantially after the company's share price surged 28.4% last Friday. Meanwhile, Intel's cash balance last stood at $14.1 billion.This indicates that the veteran chipmaker is willing to go the extra mile and is prepared to raise funds from debt or equity to make the acquisition. Intel's largest acquisition til now has been McAfee, which it purchased in 2010 for $6.8 billion in cash terms. Even in this case, the amount represented only 37% of the company's cash reserves.The reason for Intel's eagerness is its need to protect its data center business while also running its chip fabrication plants at full capacity. The company still depends on personal computers for 60% of its revenues. This segment provides good cash flows and margins but cannot possibly grow further. In the short term, Altera's faster-growing top line will add a few percentage points of growth to Intel's.Consolidation touched a three-year peak in 2014 for the semiconductor sector. Total deal value stood at $19.5 billion. In volume terms, deals in 2015 have already outpaced past last year's M&A's. Some analysts believe at least 10% of semiconductor companies listed in the U.S. will be acquired in 2015.Economies of scale are a major consideration driving this spate of deals. This in turn stems from the need to reduce costs and improve capacity utilization. The other driving force is the desire to bump up sales to boost an industry achieving maturity.In fact, most chip majors share Intel's woes. The decline of the personal computer, which constitutes the major source of demand for these chipmakers, has hastened the move toward consolidation.Some analysts opine that companies as large as Broadcom Corp.  , with a market value of $26 billion, could draw attention from potential buyers. However, more likely targets are smaller companies, starting with those that are close to Altera's size.Xilinx Inc.  , whose market value of $11 billion is nearly identical to that of Altera's, is a prime takeover candidate. Among the company's possible suitors are the likes of IBM Corp.  and QUALCOMM Inc.  . For both IBM and Qualcomm, acquiring an FPGA producer would make perfect sense.Atmel Corp.  and Silicon Laboratories Inc.  would make for even easier purchases. With market values well below $5 billion, their very size could emerge as a major problem in the current environment. Valued at around $3.5 billion, Atmel has growth woes and will gain substantially from an acquisition.Additionally, both Silicon Laboratories and Atmel can provide stable business while also presenting significant opportunities for cost reduction. Companies of this size and those that are even smaller need to evaluate their options carefully. In most cases, a strategic exit could be a prudent option.The stage is set for further consolidation in the semiconductor industry. However, it is premature to predict whether the sector will emerge stronger from this trend in 2015 itself. In the short term, potential targets could witness spikes of the kind experienced recently by Altera.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"edia sources are reporting that ""people familiar with the matter"" know that  is in advanced talks to buy out Altera  .There's no doubt it's a good fit and not entirely unexpected, which is why Wall Street has been speculating on its possibility ever since Intel became Altera's foundry of choice for advanced chips back in 2013.Altera designs the field-programmable-gate-arrays (FPGAs) that are used in telecom and computer networks, cars and other products where they are suitably reconfigured to take workloads off the main compute system and thereby speed it up.Intel, on the other hand, designs and makes the computing logic that processes the information in the system. Therefore, Intel's chips speed up when they are coupled with FPGAs, which is exactly what Chipzilla has been doing with its Xeon line for some time now.Intel has said in the past that its foundry partnerships would be strategic and that it wouldn't offer foundry services simply to keep its fabs full. And it hasn't really done anything to make us believe otherwise.After all, Altera's FPGA volumes aren't likely to be colossal and yet Intel went to a lot of trouble to get Altera on board: Altera has exclusive access to Intel's 14nm tri-gate manufacturing technology for FPGAs (albeit for a limited time). It also has a 12-year product support commitment and last-time buy rights.Intel will also have to fork out a ton of cash if it decides to terminate the contract and is not allowed to buy any other FPGA company during this time - the immediate names that come to mind are Xilinx  and much smaller rival Lattice  . All this seems to indicate that Intel wants Altera for the long haul.And the partnership has just gotten so important for Intel that it's willing to part with as much as (probably more than) $13 billion, which is Altera's current market capital. Intel barely has the short term capital necessary to make the purchase, which means it will need to raise some debt that could send it into a net debt position.So what else seems to be in the way?First, there is the ARM Holding  issue. Most chip companies dealing with consumer and communications markets are dependent on ARM technology and Altera is no different. Since ARM designs are in direct competition with Intel designs and in fact constitute one of the biggest challenges for Intel, it's hard to see Intel furthering its competitor's business. But this again could be part of the reason for the acquisition: Intel would surely like to replace ARM in mobile.Second, 14nm manufacturing hasn't started, and in the meantime, Altera being a fabless company, remains totally dependent on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company  . Transferring existing production to Intel's fabs won't be feasible cost-wise, so Intel won't see any near term benefit from the acquisition.And third, Intel's existing foundry relationship with Achronix, which also designs programmable chips, could sour. But this seems to be less of a concern at the moment, since Altera along with Xilinx, has a dominant share of the FPGA market.Whatever the outcome, the rumor mills appear to be working overtime, with Altera and Intel shares soaring a respective 28.39% and 6.38% in response.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 's (  ) fourth-quarter 2014 earnings of 36 cents per share increased 16.1% from the year-ago quarter and came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The year-over-year earnings growth was mainly driven by higher revenue base and lower share count.However, shares of this semiconductor maker dipped nearly 2% in after-hours trading as the company's revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Additionally, a soft revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2015 hurt investor's sentiments.Altera's fourth-quarter revenues increased 5.6% on a year-over-year basis to $479.9 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $482 million.The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to growth in new product revenues (59% of total revenue), which increased 32% year over year and offset a 20% decline in mainstream revenues and 17% decline in Mature and Other markets. New product revenues were primarily driven by robust performance in its 28-nanometer (nm) process node.Revenues from FPGA (84% of total revenue) increased 7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from CPLD constituted 8% of total revenue, which decreased 3% year over year. Other product revenues inched up 1% and accounted for 8% of total revenue.By verticals, all except the Networking, Computer & Storage (16% of total revenue) increased on a year-over-year basis. The Networking, Computer & Storage segment declined 11%. Telecom & Wireless (42%) increased 10% from the year-ago quarter. Industrial Automation and Military & Automotive markets revenues (22%) increased 7% year over year. The Other segment revenues (20%) increased 13% from the year-ago period.By geography, revenues from EMEA and Asia Pacific regions increased 29% and 7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, whereas the same from the Americas and Japan regions decreased 13% and 12%, respectively.Altera reported gross margin of 65%, which was down 330 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to an unfavorable product mix and higher cost of sales.However, the company was successful in managing operating expenses. Total operating expenses were down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter to $190.8 million reflecting a decline of 4.3% in selling, general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased 270 bps to 39.8% from the year-ago quarter's level of 42.5%.This, in turn, positively impacted the company's quarterly operating margin by partially offsetting the contraction in gross margin. Altera's operating margin came at 25.2%, 60 bps lower than the prior-year period operating margin of 25.8%.Reported net income was $111.1 million or 36 cents per share compared with $98.9 million or 31 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.Altera exited 2014 with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.58 billion, lower than the year-ago level of $3 billion. Long-term debt amounted to $1.49 billion, flat with the previous fiscal year. The company generated cash flow from operating activities of $666.2 million in fiscal 2014 compared with $590.2 million in fiscal 2013.During the quarter, Altera repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares for $151.5 million, Furthermore, concurrent with its earnings release, Altera announced a cash dividend of 18 cents to be paid on Mar 2, 2015 to shareholders of record as on Feb 10.Altera expects first-quarter 2015 sales in the range of flat to down 4%, sequentially. In dollar terms, it translates to a range of $460.7 to $479.9 million (mid-point $470.3 million). The weak guidance was primarily due to expectation of lower-than-expected sales from the telecom, military and industrial segments. However, management expects revenues from Wireless to increase sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $488 million. The company is positive about its 28-nm revenues for the forthcoming quarter.Management projects gross margin of approximately 65% in the first quarter. Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $112 to $116 million, while selling, general and administrative expenses will likely range between $76 million and $80 million. Tax rate is expected within 13% to 14%.Altera has posted mixed fourth-quarter 2014 results wherein its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but top line missed the same. The company's earnings and revenues improved year over year, primarily aided by strong growth in its 28-nm process node and higher growth in its FPGA solutions.However, the company provided tepid first-quarter 2015 revenue guidance due to expectation of lower-than-planned sales from the telecom, military and industrial segments.Nonetheless, growth in 3G and 4G/LTE deployments in particular will increase the demand for FPGAs, which will be beneficial for Altera. Additionally, the company's transition to 14-nm FPGAs in association with Intel Corp. (  ) is likely to be a competitive differentiator.Altera is currently manufacturing its chips using 28-nm nodes. We believe that the deployment will strengthen its product portfolio and offer more comprehensive and high-value programmable solutions.Moreover, the continued share buybacks are expected to support the company's bottom line, going forward.However, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc. (  ) and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (  ), consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are the concerns.Currently, Altera has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

alifornia-based semiconductor maker  recently announced a hike in quarterly cash dividend, effective first-quarter fiscal 2016. This is the 10 th consecutive dividend hike since the program was started in 2004.The company hiked its quarterly dividend by approximately 7% to 31 cents per share from the prior payout of 29 cents. This translates to a yearly dividend of $1.24 per share, reflecting a dividend yield of nearly 3.1% based on yesterday's closing price of $39.67. The new dividend will be paid on Jun 3 to shareholders of record as on May 13.Xilinx has a consistent track record of returning value to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend payouts. The company has returned approximately 100% of its operating cash flow over the last 10 years. Moreover, Xilinx has repurchased approximately $1.8 billion common stock since 2010.Furthermore, Xilinx has regularly paid quarterly cash dividends for the past 11 years. The company started paying 5 cents per share as quarterly dividend in fiscal 2004 which has been raised every year to reach the present amount of 31 cents. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of 18%.During the first three quarters of fiscal 2015, Xilinx returned approximately $476 million and $230.6 million through share buyback and quarterly dividends, respectively.Xilinx's strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives as well as scope for product innovation and expand in newer markets. The company generated operating cash flow of $624.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 and ended the period with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of nearly $2.92 billion.Some other companies which have a consistent track record of returning value through share repurchases and dividend payments include Yahoo! Inc.  , SanDisk Corporation  and Accenture plc  .We believe that such initiatives not only enhance shareholder return but also raise the market value of the stock. Through dividend payouts, companies bolster investors' confidence, persuading them to either buy or hold the scrip. Looking ahead, Xilinx remains confident of its growth potential, thereby raising hope for further increase in shareholder value.However, disappointing revenue guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 keeps us skeptical about the company's near-term growth prospects. The company is anticipating a sequential decline in fourth-quarter revenues due to soft performance at aerospace and defense division resulting from seasonality and timing related issues. Moreover, wireless sales are anticipated to be negatively impacted from the delay in timing of the FDD-LTE deployments.Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , in trading on Thursday, shares of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.16), with the stock changing hands as low as $37.20 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Xilinx, Inc., looking at the history chart for XLNX below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XLNX makes up 2.37% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading higher by about 0.3% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xilinx (XLNX) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark@2015-01-22@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-xlnx-shares-cross-3-yield-mark-2015-01-22
 (  ) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Jan 21. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 12.7%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx reported better-than-expected second-quarter results primarily backed by favorable product and customer mix. Going forward, the growing demand for 28-nanometer (nm) nodes due to higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to drive growth. Additionally, we believe that the company's continued focus on margin expansion, cost reduction across its product portfolio and higher yield are the positives. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues.Nonetheless, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's results in the near term. Also, stiff competition from Altera Corp. (  ) remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 60 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook Inc. (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +12.12% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Apple Inc. (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) is set to announce fourth-quarter results after the closing bell on Jan 21. It is worth noting that SanDisk has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.2%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.SanDisk's chances of beating earnings estimates in the next quarter appear doubtful going by the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and Zacks negative  of 3.48% allotted to the shares. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Recently, SanDisk lowered its revenue outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014 based on a soft demand scenario.The company expects to earn $1.73 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014, lower than the previous guidance of $1.80 billion to $1.85 billion. The leading memory chip maker for smartphones and tablets also expects its fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 45% compared to the earlier guided range of 47%-49%.Lower-than-expected demand from both iNAND products and retail sides of the business led to the weak revenue outlook. Uncertainty at smartphone makers also contributed.Several fast-growing markets, such as client and consumer PCs, smartphones and tablets, are using more NAND memory. Additionally, the yet-to-take-off ultrabooks will also use more NAND. In such a scenario, weaker-than-expected sales from NAND flash memory chips could be an indication of market share loss.Nevertheless, SanDisk remains positive on embedded solutions and enterprise SSD revenue growth, favorable product mix and better supply/demand metrics in 2015. Given the strong demand from OEM customers and enterprise demand at the 19-nanometer technology node, SanDisk expects bit supply growth to be at the lower end of the range of 30% to 40%. The company also expects revenues from enterprise SSD to surpass $1 billion in 2015.Following the most recent revenue guidance, analysts lowered their earnings estimates for fiscal 2014. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 EPS moved from $5.31 over last 60 days to the current level of $5.10. Similarly, the 2015 estimates have moved from $5.94 to $5.39 for the same time period.On Oct 16, SanDisk reported adjusted earnings of $1.31 per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share. Total revenue increased 7.5% on a year-over-year basis to $1.746 billion, which came ahead of management's guided range of $1.675 billion-$1.725 billion. However, reported revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.760 billion.Revenues from Commercial channels were strong, aided by client and enterprise class SSD sales. Moreover, the strategic acquisitions of Fusion-io Inc and SMART Storage Systems are expected to expand SanDisk's offerings in the Enterprise SSD segment.Lackluster PC sales, competition from Micron Technology Inc. (  ) and currency fluctuations remain headwinds. However, we remain positive on management's expectations of a turnaround in the coming quarters and strong secular demand for its storage products.It is also worth mentioning that Apple Inc. is currently a major customer of SanDisk. Hence, we believe that price and cost benefits as well as a long-term NAND supply agreement with a company like Apple will help SanDisk to outperform the NAND market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

hares of  (  ) have generated a return of 6.6% over the last three months. The company also delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.We are optimistic about the company after it posted better-than-expected results in the last-reported quarter. Xilinx's earnings of 62 cents per share not only increased 26.5% year over year but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share.However, Xilinx's year-over-year revenue growth was marginal (0.9%). The company's 28-nm sales remained flat, while 40-nm sales were down. This led to the tepid revenue performance. Nonetheless, the company's revenues of $604.3 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $601 million. The year-over-year increase was due to an 8% improvement in revenues from Industrial and Aerospace & Defense markets (41% of total revenue) while revenues from Other sources increased 12%.Moreover, the company provided decent third-quarter revenue guidance. Further, Xilinx expects revenues from wired and wireless communications to increase modestly in the December quarter while the 28-nm revenues are expected to be up sequentially. The company expects global LTE deployment activity to positively impact its results.The price appreciation can also be attributed to Xilinx's significant exposure to telecom and wireless vertical markets. These markets are strongly correlated with global GDP growth and spending behavior. Most of the emerging economies are seeing unprecedented demand for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets and are also getting increasingly connected via the Internet. This has compelled these countries to heavily invest in telecom and wireless infrastructure. We believe that Xilinx is well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.Going forward, the growing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. We believe that the company's continued focus on margin expansion, cost reduction across its product portfolio and higher yield are positives. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues.We also remain optimistic about the company's future performance due to its endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividends. During the first half of fiscal 2015, Xilinx returned approximately $301 million and $154 million to shareholders through share buybacks and quarterly dividends, respectively. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also instill investors' confidence and loyalty.However, delays in China LTE deployments and stiff competition from Altera Corp. (  ) remain near-term headwinds.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the technology sector include EMC Corporation (  ) and Avago Technologies Limited (  ), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

n Dec 22, we issued an updated research report on  (  ) following the company's better-than-expected third-quarter 2014 results.Revenues improved on a year-over-year basis backed by growth in new product revenues (56% of total revenue), up 45% from the year-ago quarter, which offset a respective decline of 13% and 14% in mainstream revenues and Mature and Other markets. New product revenues were primarily driven by robust performance in its 28-nanometer (nm) process node.Furthermore, Altera is witnessing higher revenues from its field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) offerings. During the third quarter, FPGA revenues increased 17% on a year-over-year basis and accounted for 85% of total revenue.Additionally, Altera's transition to 14-nm FPGAs in association with Intel Corp. (  ) is likely to be a competitive differentiator. Intel will be making chips for Altera using its 14-nm Tri-gate transistor technology. The agreement between the two companies also states that only Altera will be allowed to have access to this technology. Therefore, this will give Altera a leap of 2-4 years over its rivals. Hence, it will be difficult for Xilinx Inc. (  ) to adopt Intel's technology to match its rival's offerings.It is also worth noting that Altera is a fabless company. It does not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon and instead works with independent merchant foundries and chip assemblers for manufacturing its products. This benefits the company with superior manufacturing capability, scalability, as well as flexibility to move wafer manufacture, assembly and test of products to vendors that offer better technology and services at competitive prices.Apart from this, Altera has a consistent record of returning cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend payouts. During the first three quarters of 2014, the company returned approximately $149.8 million as quarterly dividends and $503 million through share buybacks.During the third-quarter conference call, the company stated that it intends to buy back approximately $700 million worth of its common stock in 2014, which along with dividend payments will be much ahead of its targeted range of returning 60-80% of cash flow from operating activities. These continued share buybacks are expected to support the company's bottom line, going forward.However, we are slightly cautious about the company's future performance due to the persistent softness in the deployment of TD-LTE in China. Over the past few quarters, Chinese telecom companies such as China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom have slowed their spending on 4G deployments, affecting Altera's TD-LTE shipments in the country. This is making it difficult to predict the company's growth over the next few quarters.In addition, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (  ), consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are the concerns.Currently, Altera has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

emiconductor chipmaker,  (  ) recently authorized an additional stock repurchase program, thereby maintaining the trend of returning wealth to its shareholders from time to time, depending on market conditions. Under this program, the company is authorized to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock.This raises the cumulative share repurchase authorization to $3.25 billion. The company had roughly $213 million worth of shares available for repurchase under the program as of Nov 1, 2014. Under the new authorization program Marvell bought back approximately $220 million worth of its common stock representing nearly 30% of its total outstanding shares at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The latest buyback scheme reflects the company's sound financial position and favorable prospects.During the recently-concluded third quarter of 2014, Marvell bought shares for a total of $43.8 million. Apart from share buyback, Marvell also has a dividend distribution policy in place. Marvell paid dividends of $30.9 million during the said quarter.The share buyback authorization reflects the company's confidence in its fundamentals. At the same time, the share buyback will help the company reduce the outstanding share count, thereby increasing earnings per share and return on equity. This strategic move will also lift the relatively undervalued share price.Marvell's strong balance sheet and cash flow provide it with the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives as well as scope for product innovation and expansion of operations in new markets. The company generated operating cash flow of $194.6 million in the third-quarter of fiscal 2015, ending the period with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of nearly $2.4 billion.We appreciate Marvell's efforts to consistently enhance long-term shareholder value even in times of an economic downturn. We believe that an increase in share buyback authorization and dividend payment affirms the company's optimistic outlook and growth prospects.Some other companies which have a consistent track record of returning excess cash through share repurchases and dividend payments include Xilinx Inc. (  ), SanDisk Corp. (  ) and Micron Technology (  ).Currently, Marvell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

" reported its second quarter results after Thursday's market close. The maker of programmable semiconductors delivered revenue for the quarter that was reasonably in line with expectations, but better-than-expected margins propelled net income to a solid over-performance at $171.5 million. The earnings beat drove Xilinx stock up roughly 5.5% higher in after-hours trading. Xilinx's second quarter revenue came in at $604 million , up 1% over the corresponding period in its last fiscal year. Revenue was down 1% from the preceding quarter, in line with company expectations that a dip between 1% and 4% would occur. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.62, up 27% from the same period last year.
  
Revenue beat the consensus estimates by 0.43%, while earnings per share came in roughly 12.7% higher than expected. Compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2014, Xilinx delivered operating income growth of 22%, and grew net income 21%.While sales were in line with the company's guidance, its operating margins were better than expected, growing from 27% to 33% year-over-year. The company saw its share of revenue from the communications and data segment fall to 41%, down from 50% in the previous fiscal quarter. The company delivered on its projected rebound in its defense and aeronautics segment, which rose to 41% from 31% in the previous quarter, helping to offset the decline in communications. The programmable logic device market is expected to grow significantly over the next five years, a trend that has the potential to benefit Xilinx. A recent report from TechNavio estimates that the sector will see 14.8% CAGR from 2013 to 2018, which could give the chipmaker a cushion even if it starts to lose market share to competitors.It currently controls roughly 50% of the programmable semiconductor market and should continue to be a driving player in this field, but there are factors that complicate the future of the company and its stock.  , Xilinx's chief rival in the PLD space, looks to offer customers technological advantages when new-generation chips achieve commercial prominence. Xilinx currently accounts for roughly 70% of 28-nanometer PLD sales, but Altera has beaten the company to the 14-nm die shrink. This technological advantage could force Xilinx to increase research and development spending.In addition to challenges presented by established competition, there are also broader threats to the American semiconductor industry to consider. October 9 saw  issue a downward revision on its earnings estimates due to soft demand from China, and the company indicated that a market correction in the semiconductor industry could be under way. Xilinx has since recovered from the price dip that this announcement spurred on, but concerns about the future of the semiconductor remain.China has also announced that it plans to become a bigger force in the chip industry, and reports suggest that a recently established fund dedicated to this end could reach $19.5 billion in initial investments.Given that American companies currently have a firm grasp on the PLD market, and the importance of these chips in communications, aeronautics, and defense technologies, devoting resources to being more competitive in this field would seem to be a logical move. Xilinx's most recent quarter saw 37% of its business come from Asia Pacific territories, so increased local competition in this region has the potential to destabilize the company's business. The company's recently announced partnership with  in the development of virtualized 5G networks may offer some assurance on this front, but the development of the Chinese semiconductor market remains a point of concern.For its December quarter, the company projects that revenue will remain flat or see an increase of up to 4%, and expects a gross margin of approximately 69%. Sales of its 28-nm chips are expected to rebound. The company expects annual sales from this line to reach approximately $600 million, increasing nearly 60% over the previous fiscal year. Xilinx's latest quarterly report delivered solid results. The company managed to significantly grow its earnings per share thanks to improved margins, and the rebound of its defense and aeronautics sales gives the appearance of a more balanced business structure. The rollout of 4G LTE networks and the performance of its 28-nm chips will likely be the key points to watch for the remainder of the fiscal year.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development ""dream team"" -- Apple Watch.

hares of  (  ) jumped 3.92% in after-hours trade on Thursday following the company's second-quarter earnings of 62 cents which not only increased 26.5% year over year but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents.Expectedly Xilinx's year-over-year revenue growth was marginal (0.9%) in the quarter. The company's 28-nanometer (nm) sales remained flat during the quarter while 40-nm sales were down which led to the tepid revenue performance. Nonetheless, the company's revenues of $604.3 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $601 million.The year-over-year increase was due to 8% improvement in revenues from Industrial, Aerospace & Defense (41% of second-quarter fiscal 2015 revenues) and revenues from Other sources increased 12% in the quarter.Nonetheless, Xilinx witnessed a 4% year-over-year decline in revenues from Communications & Data Center (41% of revenues) due to lower sales to two major communication customers. Also, revenues from Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive segment were down 6% on a year-over-year basis.Geographically, revenues from North America were up 3% year over year, while Asia Pacific and Europe were down 2% each. On the other hand, revenues from Japan were up 13% on a year-over-year basis.Xilinx reported 245 basis points (bps) gross margin expansion year on year to 71.9%, primarily attributable to customer mix and favorable product mix.Operating expenses for the quarter were down 7% to $234.6 million and, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were down 331 bps on a year-over-year basis. This aided Xilinx's operating margins which increased 577 bps year over year to 33.1%. In dollar terms, operating income for the quarter increased 22.2% to $200 million.Xilinx's net income for the quarter came in at $171.5 million or 62 cents compared with $141.5 million or 49 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Xilinx ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term investments of $2.59 billion compared with $2.48 billion in the previous quarter. The company has long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of $1.56 billion. Xilinx generated $204 million of cash from operations and incurred $8 million in capital expenditure. The company paid $77 million in cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $200 million.Management expects third-quarter revenues in the range of flat to up 4% on a sequential basis, which comes to a range of $604 to $628.2 million (mid-point $616.1 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $625 million.Gross margin is forecast to be roughly 69%. Operating expenses are expected to be around $230 million, which includes approximately $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Share count is expected to be approximately 272 million and effective tax rate to be about 13%.Xilinx expects revenues from wired and wireless communications to increase modestly in the December quarter while the 28-nm revenues are expected to be up sequentially. The company expects global LTE deployment activity to positively impact its results.Xilinx reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. Also, third-quarter revenue guidance was modest. The growing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company also expects a rebound in the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense sales. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues.Nonetheless, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's near-term results. Also, stiff competition from Altera (  ) remains a headwind.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Investors may also consider other better ranked stocks such as Rambus (  ) and SunEdison (  ).

 (  ) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Oct 16. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 0.41%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. Higher sales of 40-nanometer (nm) and 65-nm technology helped it to post year-over-year increase in revenues. Also, higher revenues and favorable product mix aided margins.The growing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company also expects a rebound in the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense sales. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues.Nonetheless, delay in China LTE deployments and higher spending on research and development, and selling, general and administrative segments could impact the company's results in the near term. Also, stiff competition from Altera (  ) remains a headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Xilinx currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apple Inc.

 's stock has shown weakness over the last six months. After hitting record-high pricing in March, the maker of programmable logic devices delivered two consecutive disappointing quarterly reports, and shares now trade roughly 33% lower than their peak valuation. The staggered rollout of China's 4G LTE networks and underperformance from Xilinx's defense and aerospace segments have been major contributors to the downward pressure.On Oct. 10, the stock fell roughly 8% after  issued softer than expected earnings projections and suggested the revision was connected to broader market correction in the chip industry. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index declined roughly 7% in response to the news, and Xilinx now trades at year long lows. data by  .Even with the company's stumbles and an uptick in pessimism about the broader semiconductor industry, Xilinx could be an attractive option for income investors. With a market cap of roughly $10 billion, the stock trades at roughly 16 times trailing earnings. This ratio compares favorably against other companies in the programmable semiconductor sector, and recent sell-offs have driven the company's dividend yield to 3.16%, a level that might pique the interest of income investors. Here are three more reasons why Xilinx deserves consideration as a top dividend stock. Since it started paying a dividend in 2004, Xilinx has raised its payout nine times, corresponding to a 480% increase over its initial payment. These increases have been implemented on a near-yearly basis, establishing a consistent history of returned value for shareholders. Over the last five years, the company increased its quarterly dividend payout from roughly $0.16 to $0.29 per share, an increase of about 81%, corresponding with notable increases in profit margin. More broadly, the company has maintained healthy profit margins for over a decade and has shown a firm commitment to passing profits along to shareholders. data by  .While certain threats to Xilinx's business require consideration, investors probably don't need to worry much about the company lowering or erasing its dividend. The quarterly payouts have become an entrenched part of its stock pricing, and history suggests the company will continue to raise its dividend on a relatively consistent basis. In its last fiscal year, Xilinx paid out $267 million in dividends to shareholders, while also repurchasing $242 million in company shares. This occurred even as the chipmaker generated roughly $749 million in operating income and $639 million in net income. Even if cash flow were to become a problem for the company, it has the assets needed to sustain its dividend.The company's June quarterly report listed roughly $2.49 billion in cash and short-term assets, while Xilinx's quarterly dividend of $0.29 suggests an annual payout of $1.16 for each of the 268.48 million shares oustanding. Ifcash flow dried up significantly and the company was forced to pay dividends from its cash and short-term assets, it could hypothetically continue the current level of payouts for somewhere between six and eight years, depending on the costs of repatriating its offshore assets. Having market leadership in a sector that looks to experience continued growth provides no surefire indication of success for a company or its stock, but Xilinx's position in the chip industry might be appealing to investors. On the same day that Microchip Technology issued its disappointing projections and suspicions of a semiconductor market correction, analysis published by TechNavio suggested the  for programmable logic devices would grow at a compound annual rate of 14.8% from 2013 and 2018.Xilinx holds about 50% of this semiconductor market. Despite strong competition, particularly from chief rival,  , the company appears to have an opportunity to benefit form the growth of PLDs. The recent announcement of a collaboration with the  Research Institute for the creation of virtualized 5G networks suggests the chip company will preserve its position in communications technologies beyond the current 4G rollout. Even if Xilinx's market share slips, growth in PLDs offers avenues to prosperity. For income investors who aren't averse to tech or semiconductor companies, Xilinx could be a good play. The chipmaker doesn't have the same consumer brand strength or size of  --  another dividend-paying semiconductor company that deserves a look -- but its dividend history and structure could be particularly attractive in light of the growth potential in PLDs. Even amid industry uncertainties, the sizable dip in the company's valuation could offer dividend investors a worthwhile entry point to the stock. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their nondividend-paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute. They also know that a well-constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily, while still allowing you to sleep like a baby.

" is a leader in the programmable logic devices field, controlling approximately 50% of the market it specializes in. Despite its strong position in a growing industry, the company has seen its share price fall roughly 18% year to date, and now trades in the $37 range, representing a new 52-week low.The maker of programmable circuits supplies chips that are used in cell-phone communication towers, and has recently experienced some turbulence due to a slower-than-expected rollout of 4G technology in China. The downward pressure on its price has pushed its dividend yield up to 3.1%, a level that compares favorably against other semiconductor companies that pay dividends. data by  .With its share price at relatively low levels, strong cash flow, and history of raising its dividend payout, there are compelling reasons to take a position in Xilinx. That said, the company is also facing some significant hurdles, and these challenging elements should be weighed against its apparent strengths for a more complete estimation of the stock's future.Here are two things that Xilinx dividend investors need to know. As the world's largest market for mobile devices, China is key to Xilinx's future. Thirty-five percent of the company's revenue in its last fiscal year came from Asia-Pacific territories, and that share should be significantly higher this year due to 4G LTE expansion in the region.To give an idea of what the geographic breakdown of its business might look like by the end of the annual fiscal term, its last-recorded quarter saw 43% of its business come out of China and other Asia-Pacific territories. With the rollout still under way, it's not unreasonable to believe that the annual share will be even higher. Having a leading position in the world's biggest mobile market is great, but there are also circumstances and conditions in China that could destabilize Xilinx's business and stock.Mounting tensions between China and Hong Kong and Taiwan have also heightened tensions between the Eastern power and Western nations. The political flare-ups arrive on the heels of concerted antitrust investigations by China designed to reveal alleged improprieties by foreign companies that do business within its borders. Among many others, these anti-monopoly investigations have targeted American tech companies like  and  , and the belief that these regulatory probes are being conducted with the intent of creating a business climate more favorable to Chinese companies is not uncommon.While Xilinx can't reasonably be said to have a monopoly on the programmable logic devices market, it essentially splits the sector with its main competitor,  . That these American companies control the production of chips that are fundamental in communications and defense technologies goes against China's national interests, and it's possible that the country will use its regulatory muscle in ways damaging to Xilinx's business, or that it will attempt to prop up a local manufacturer of programmable semiconductors. The current market for programmable logic devices may be large enough, and growing fast enough, to allow both Xilinx and Altera to prosper; but it's difficult to predict how the adoption of their respective technologies will impact market share. Xilinx sells roughly 70% of the world's programmable 28-nanometer chips, but Altera may have significant advantages when it comes to next generation die shrinks. The rival company has partnered with Intel to manufacture and market 14-nm chips, which represents a significant threat to Xilinx's own, less-advanced, 16-nm offerings.Altera's software system is also widely viewed as stronger than what Xilinx offers, so as 28-nm programmable devices are phased out in favor of the next-generation sets, it looks like Altera has the opportunity to increase its market share. Xilinx may be forced to increase its research and development expenditures, or lower its prices if Altera's chips gain market favor. Either of these moves could hurt the company's margins.Last year, Xilinx distributed $267 million in dividend payments to investors. With cash and short-term investment holdings of approximately $2.5 billion, the company could continue to pay dividends at current levels for eight years even if it fails to generate profit throughout that period. That's not a likely scenario, but it is an indication that the company's dividend structure is strong, particularly in light of sustained increases to payouts during the last 10 years.Investors can be reasonably assured that Xilinx's dividend offering will remain an attractive component of the stock. Whether or not the company can grow in line with its targets and retain its market share advantage are the bigger points of uncertainty.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development ""dream team"" -- Apple Watch. The secret is out, and some early viewers are claiming its everyday impact could trump the iPod, iPhone,  the iPad.

 (  ) reported earnings of 41 cents per share in the second-quarter of 2014, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. Earnings also increased 29.1% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to a higher revenue base and lower share count.Altera's second-quarter revenues not only increased 16.5% on a year-over-year basis to $491.5 million, but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $479.0 million.The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to growth in new product revenues (53.0% of total revenue), which increased 53.0% year over year and offset the 11.0% decline in mainstream revenues and a 5.0% decline in Mature and Other markets. New product revenues were primarily driven by robust performance in its 28-nm process node and 40-nm products.Revenues from FPGA (84.0% of total revenue) increased 18.0% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from CPLD and other products, which constitute 8.0% of total revenue each, increased 7.0% and 12.0%, respectively.By verticals, all except the Networking, Computer & Storage (15.0% of total revenue) increased on a year-over-year basis. The Networking, Computer & Storage segment witnessed a decline of 6.0%. Telecom & Wireless (46.0% of total revenue) increased 28.0% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to LTE deployments in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and Japan, and China Mobile LTE deployment. Industrial Automation and Military & Automotive markets, which comprised 21.0% of second-quarter revenues, increased 14.0% from the year-ago quarter. Other segment (18.0% of total revenue) increased 16.0% from the year-ago period.By geography, Asia Pacific grew 28.0% on a year-over-year basis, whereas revenues from EMEA and Americas increased 13.0% and 9.0%, respectively. Revenues from Japan increased 3.0% on a year-over-year basisAltera reported gross margin of 66.9%, which was down 101 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to an unfavorable product mix.Operating margin came in at 29.8%, up from 26.6% in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses increased 4.7% year over year, reflecting a 5.9% rise in research and development expenses and a 1.4% increase in selling, general, and administrative expense. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 418 bps to 37.1% from the year-ago quarter, which favorably impacted margins.Reported net income was $127.0 million or 41 cents per share compared with $101.5 million or 31 cents per share in the second quarter of 2013. Including gain on securities and gain from the reclassification, net income was $141.4 million compared with $92.4 million in the year-ago quarter.Altera exited the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.81 billion compared with $2.91 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt amounted to $1.49 billion. The company generated cash flow from operating activities of $301.4 million.During the quarter, Altera repurchased approximately 6.0 million shares at a cost of $197.0 million and announced a cash dividend of 18 cents to be paid on Sep 2, 2014.Altera expects sales to increase in the range of (2.0%) to 2.0%, sequentially ($481.7 million to $501.3 million) in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $481.0 million. Also, the company is positive about its 28-nanometer revenues in the forthcoming quarter.Management expects revenues from Telecom & Wireless to be flat, sequentially. Industrial Automation, Military & Automotive revenues are also expected to be flat, sequentially. However, Networking, Computer & Storage revenues are expected to increase quarter over quarter.Management projects gross margin of roughly 67.0% in the third quarter. Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $114.0 million to $116.0 million, while selling, general and administrative expenses will likely range between $78.0 million and $80.0 million. Tax rate is expected in a range of 11.0% to 12.0%.Altera has delivered better-than-expected second-quarter 2014 results. Both revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily aided by strong growth in its 28nm process node and constant development from its 40 nm products. Moreover, the company provided an encouraging third-quarter revenue guidance.Also, growth in 4G/LTE deployments in particular will increase demand for FPGAs, which will be beneficial for Altera. Additionally, Altera's transition to 14nm FPGAs in association with Intel Corp. (  ) is likely to be a competitive differentiator.Altera is currently manufacturing its chips using 28-nanometer nodes. We believe that the deployment will help Altera to strengthen its product portfolio and offer more comprehensive and high-value programmable solutions.Moreover, the continued share buybacks are expected to support the company's bottom line, going forward.However, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc. (  ) and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (  ), consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are concerns.Currently, Altera holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

fter the S&P 500 lost 2.7 percent last week in a sharp sell-off, investors are likely to be cautious this week as they worry about the possibility of a correction.Investors haven't seen a decline of more than ten percent in about three years, so most believe that a correction is long overdue.However, analysts are maintaining their optimism and expecting stocks to rebound as the U.S. economic environment remains conductive to a bullish market.In other news around the markets:On Sunday, Lisbon announced that it was planning to spend almost five billion euros in order to rescue its largest bank, Banco Espirito Santo. The news created a wave of relief across the eurozone as the collapse of Banco Espirito Santo could have sparked a fresh wave of banking troubles for the region's already fragile financial markets. Rebel groups continued to jockey for position in Tripoli over the weekend, leaving more than 20 people dead in battles for control of the nation's airport. As the Libyan conflict worsened, most Western nations evacuated their embassies and advised citizens to leave the country. On Sunday Britain sent a Navy ship to evacuate more than 100 British nationals as the fighting looked to be sliding out of control. On Monday, Russia made plans to begin new military exercises at the Ukrainian border that will include the use of bombers and fighter jets as accusations that Moscow is supplying rebel groups with arms and training continued to circulate. The demonstration is likely a show of strength to Western nations after Western officials condemned Russia back in March for performing military drills at the border. After a 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck China on Sunday, rescue officials are working to rescue survivors and get medical attention and supplies to those in need. However, the already difficult task of getting through heavy rubble was made more difficult by bad weather conditions, making the rescue effort a slow process. Reports of nearly 400 people dead and 1,800 more injured are likely to increase as rescuers continue their efforts.Asian markets were higher except the NIKKEI, which lost 0.31 percent.

" is the world's leading provider of freely programmable gate array, or FPGA, circuits, but investors are looking skeptically at the company and its stock followingthe July release of its first-quarter report. Revenue came in substantially below consensus estimates and targets for the company's second-quarter performance were revised down. This corresponded with an approximately 19% dip in the company's price to a yearlong low of $39.12 a share . data by  .While Xilinx offers an attractive 2.7% dividend yield and an industry-best price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 19 times trailing earnings, there are still reasons to approach the company's stock with caution. The following three factors could apply significant downward pressure on Xilinx's share price.In its most recently recorded fiscal quarter, 43% of Xilinx's revenue came from Asia-Pacific markets. As the biggest market for smartphones, China is central to the company's earnings and growth plans, and the slowed rollout of the nation's 4G LTE network was one of the main reasons that revenue came in below expectations last quarter. The company's 28-nanometer nodes are key components in cell phone base stations used by  . The circuit maker stands to benefit as more bases are built, but the political and economic climate in China present obstacles for an American tech company like Xilinx.Xilinx and its chief competitor,  , effectively have a duopoly on the production of programmable logic devices, and it's not unreasonable to believe that regulatory measures could be used to create a market climate more favorable to domestic base-station vendors such as  and  , as well as China Mobile and other carriers.Relying on Xilinx and Altera for FPGA production creates economic and defense liabilities for China, and the nation has a clear interest in improving its ability to manufacture semiconductors. Even if Xilinx's intellectual property is not infringed upon, downward pressure on its pricing could be applied, and the possibility exists that Xilinx could find itself the subject of antitrust investigations and penalties. If the Chinese market becomes less hospitable, Xilinx's otherwise strong operating margins could be negatively affected.In 2013, Xilinx claimed 51% of the global programmable logic device market, while Altera captured 38% of the segment. With approximately 70% of global 28-nanometer node sales, Xilinx is in good position to benefit as use of these circuits grows this year. However, Altera looks to be mounting an increasing challenge to the company's dominance. Forty-three percent of Altera's revenue in its last fiscal year came from the sale of 28-nm chips, and Huawei and ZTE honored the company with awards that could be taken as indications that the Chinese companies will shift more of their business from Xilinx to Altera.Altera also looks to enjoy an advantage heading into the next generation of die shrinks. While Xilinx shipped its 20-nm chips to market ahead of its competitor, the circuit architecture is not yet widely used, and Altera's own 20-nm offering may enjoy greater support due to software advantages on the company's platform. Even worse for Xilinx, Altera is partnering with  to produce 14-nm chips that could gain market favor over its upcoming 16-nm set. Altera's presumed technological advantage might help it position its FPGA offerings as the best solution for customers looking to move away from application-specific chips where possible.The reliability of Xilinx's guidance has recently been called into question, and perplexing comments from company executives have provided additional reasons to view its public statements and projections with wary eyes. CEO Moshe Gavrielov has said that his company will benefit from a resurgence of wireless and defense contracts this quarter, yet the company expects revenue to remain flat or decrease by 4% from the previous quarter. This projected stagnation or decline in revenue is supposed to arrive even as rollout of 4G LTE in China spreads, suggesting Gavrielov's claim may be inaccurate, or that the company will see significant deterioration in other parts of its business.The last quarter saw 50% of Xilinx's revenue come from communications and databases, and 31% of its business derived from industrials and aeronautics and defense, which would seem to suggest significant decline in its other segments if its chief revenue generators are set to rebound. Additionally, Xilinx's stated belief in an uptick in wireless and defense business this quarter arrived in conjunction with a downward revision of its yearly revenue growth from 10% to 5%.In May, Xilinx CFO Jon Olson put forth very rosy portrayals of the company's position in China and broader future. These statements, in conjunction with the company's disappointing quarterly report and forecast revision, contributed to a Louisiana law firm's decision to open an investigation into whether the company violated state and federal securities codes. If the next quarter's results expose additional inaccuracies in Xilinx's guidance, or if problematic news emerges before then, investors might lose patience and confidence in the company's executive team.As the company is a dominant player in a growing space, there are strong reasons to consider a position in Xilinx. That said, investors should weigh the company's recent stumblings and future uncertainties against its hypothetical potential. While the risks facing Xilinx don't assure that it will suffer going forward, their capacity to trigger a falling share price makes them worthy of consideration.Apple recently recruited a secret-development ""dream team"" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible.

 (  ) reported adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Reported earnings increased 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.However, shares plummeted 9.14% in after-hours trade as the company issued tepid revenue guidance for the September quarter.Xilinx's revenues of $612.6 million were up 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year increase was due to 20.0% improvement in revenues from Communications & Data Center segment (50.0% of first-quarter fiscal 2015 revenues) primarily due to LTE deployments outside China. The company also witnessed higher shipment of 40-nanometer (nm) and 65-nm technology.Xilinx also witnessed a 3.0% year-over-year growth in revenues from Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive (15% of first-quarter revenues) and revenues from Other sources, comprising 2.0% of total revenue, increased 11.0% year over year. However, revenues from Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment (31.0% of first-quarter revenues) were down 11.0% year over year.Geographically, revenues from North America were down 12.0% year over year while Asia Pacific and Japan increased 26.0% and 21.0% year over year, respectively. On the other hand, revenues from Europe were down 7.0% on a year-over-year basis.Xilinx reported 16 basis points (bps) gross margin expansion year on year to 69.1%, primarily attributable to higher revenues and favorable product mix.Adjusted operating expenses (excluding amortization) for the quarter increased 5.2% to $214.5 million but as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were down 20 bps on a year-over-year basis. This positively impacted Xilinx's operating margins which increased 36 bps year over year.Xilinx's adjusted net income for the quarter came in at $176.0 million or 62 cents compared with $159.4 million or 56 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Xilinx ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term investments of $2.48 billion compared with $2.46 billion in the previous quarter. The company has long-term debt (long-term debt plus current portion) of $1.56 billion. Xilinx generated $130.0 million of cash from operations and incurred $9.0 million in capital expenditure. The company paid $77.0 million in cash dividends and repurchased shares worth $100.0 million.Management expects September quarter revenues in the range of (4.0%) to flat on a sequential basis, which comes to a range of $588.0 to $612.6 million range, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $643.0 million. This tepid revenue guidance was due to delay in China LTE deployments.Gross margin is forecast to be roughly 70.0%. Operating expenses are expected to be around $236.0 million, including approximately $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Share count is expected to be approximately 282 million and effective tax rate to be about 13.0%.Xilinx also provided a glimpse of its fiscal 2015 expectations. The company expects revenues to increase 5.0% for the fiscal year buoyed by the 28-nm growth opportunities. The company also expects its December and March quarters to be positively impacted by wireless sales in China.Management also expects gross margins to remain in the range of 68.0% to 70.0% while the operating expenses to be lower due to operating efficiencies. The company stressed the importance of innovative product development and expects its research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses to be $530.0 million and $380.0 million, respectively, for fiscal 2015.Xilinx reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. However, second-quarter revenue guidance was tepid. Nonetheless, the growing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company also expects a rebound in the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense sales. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues.However, stiff competition from  (  ) and dwindling PC (significant consumer for semiconductor chips) market sales keep us concerned for the near term.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

n Jun 13, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ) following the company's better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2014 results.Revenues improved on a year-over-year basis attributable to growth in new product revenues (49.0% of total revenue), which increased 39.0% from the year-ago quarter and offset the 12.0% decline in mainstream revenues. Altera saw year-over-year growth across both geography and verticals.Additionally, Altera's transition to 14-nm FPGAs in association with  (  ) is likely to be a competitive differentiator. Intel will be making chips for Altera using its 14-nm trigate transistor technology. Hence, it will be difficult for  (  ) to adopt Intel's technology to match its rival's offerings.Furthermore, Altera is witnessing higher revenues from its FPGA offerings. FPGAs are widely used in third generation (3G) and fourth generation long-term evolution (4G LTE) network connections. A higher percentage of FPGAs per base station allows higher data bandwidth. We believe Altera is well equipped with FPGA product suites (Stratix, Arria and Cyclone) to take share in the growing PLD market.It is also worth noting that Altera is a fabless company. It does not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon and instead works with independent merchant foundries and chip assemblers for the manufacture of products. This benefits the company with superior manufacturing capability, scalability, as well as flexibility to move wafer manufacture, assembly and test of products to vendors that offer superior technology and services at competitive prices.Altera is currently manufacturing its chips using 28-nanometer processes. We believe that this will help Altera to strengthen its product portfolio and offer more comprehensive and high-value programmable solutions.Apart from this, Altera has solid cash generating abilities. Out of its total cash flow, 61.3% has been used for dividends and share buybacks in fiscal 2013. Moreover, during the first three months of fiscal 2014, Altera paid dividends worth $47.6 million and bought shares amounting to $161.8 million. These continued share buybacks are expected to support the company's bottom line going forward.On the other hand, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx and  (  ), consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market remain concerns.Currently, Altera has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

 (  ) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Jul 22. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.6%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Xilinx reported mixed fourth-quarter results wherein the top line exceeded the Zack Consensus Estimate but the bottom line lagged the same. However, both revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis. Improvement in revenues from Communications & Data Center segment primarily due to China LTE deployments contributed to the year-over-year increase in the top line.Moreover, the growing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. We believe that the company's continued focus on margin expansion, cost reduction across its product portfolio and higher yield are positives. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues.However, stiff competition from Altera Corp. and dwindling PC (significant consumer for semiconductor chips) market sales keep us concerned for the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Xilinx will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 61 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Xilinx's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +31.58% and holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +3.81% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

"n the latest look at the underlying components of the S&P 500 ordered by largest market capitalization, Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX) has taken over the #321 spot from Coach, Inc. (Symbol: COH), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true ""apples-to-apples"" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Xilinx, Inc. (Symbol: XLNX), the market cap is now $12.59 billion, versus Coach, Inc. (Symbol: COH) at $12.39 billion.Below is a chart of Xilinx, Inc. versus Coach, Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (XLNX plotted in blue; COH plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of XLNX vs. COH:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and ""tosses out"" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller ""up-and-comers"" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, XLNX and COH collectively make up 1.95% of the iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF (  ) which is higher by about 0.4% on the day Wednesday.At the closing bell, XLNX is up about 0.3%, while COH is down about 2.3% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Xilinx Takes Over #321 Spot From Coach@2014-04-30@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-takes-over-321-spot-coach-2014-04-30

 (  ) reported earnings of 37 cents per share in the first quarter of 2014, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents. Earnings remained relatively flat on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to lower-than-expected operating expenses.Altera's first-quarter revenues not only increased 12.3% on a year-over-year basis to $461.1 million, but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $439.0 million.The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to growth in new product revenues (49.0% of total revenue), which increased 39.0% year over year and offset the 12.0% decline in mainstream revenues.By verticals, all except the Networking, Computer & Storage (15.0% of total revenue) increased on a year-over-year basis. The Networking, Computer & Storage segment witnessed a decline of 7.0%, primarily due to weaker-than-expected demand for computers and tepid demand from vendors of flash-based storage systems. Telecom & Wireless (45.0% of total revenue) increased 23.0% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to LTE deployment in China. Industrial Automation and Military & Automotive markets, which comprised of 22% of first quarter revenues, increased 13.0% from the year-ago quarter. Other segments (18% of total revenue) increased in single-digit from the year-ago period.By geography, Asia Pacific grew 24.0% on a year-over-year basis, whereas revenues from Japan and EMEA increased 18.0% and 11.0%, respectively. However, revenues from Americas declined 13.0%.Altera reported gross margin of 67.1%, which was down 223 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter primarily due to an unfavorable product mix.Operating margin came in at 29.2%, up from 28.7% in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses increased 4.9% year over year, reflecting an 11.3% rise in research and development expenses. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 270 bps to 37.9% from the year-ago quarter, which favorably impacted margins.Reported net income was $116.5 million or 37 cents per share compared with $120.2 million or 37 cents per share in the first quarter of 2013. Including gain on securities and gain from the reclassification, net income was $129.0 million compared with $120.1 in the year-ago quarter.Altera exited the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.91 billion compared with $3.01 billion in the previous quarter. The company generated cash flow from operating activities of $130.4 million.Altera expects sales to increase in the range of 2% to 6% sequentially ($470.3 million to $488.8 million) in the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $463.0 million. Management expects revenues from Telecom & Wireless to be up with wireless revenues increasing sharply, primarily due to China LTE shipments. Industrial Automation, Military & Automotive revenues are expected to be down, sequentially. However, Networking, Computer & Storage revenues are expected to increase quarter over quarter.Management projects gross margin of roughly 67.0% in the second quarter. Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $104.0 million to $106.0 million, while selling, general and administrative expenses will likely range between $78.0 million and $80.0 million. Tax rate is expected in a range of 12.0% to 13.0%.Altera has delivered better-than-expected first-quarter 2014 results with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Although revenues increased year over year, earnings remained relatively flat. The company provided a modest guidance for the upcoming quarter.Nonetheless, growth in 4G/LTE deployments in particular will increase demand for FPGAs, which will be beneficial for Altera. Additionally, Altera's transition to 14nm FPGAs in association with  (  ) is likely to be a competitive differentiator.Altera is currently manufacturing its chips using 28-nanometer nodes. We believe that the deployment will help Altera to strengthen its product portfolio and offer more comprehensive and high-value programmable solutions.However, macroeconomic weakness, competition from  (  ) and  (  ), consolidation in the telecom market, declining margins and volatility in the semiconductor market are concernsCurrently, Altera holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Altera's Q1 Earnings & Revs Beat Estimates - Analyst Blog@2014-04-25@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alteras-q1-earnings-revs-beat-estimates-analyst-blog-2014-04-25

hares of  (  ) hit a new 52-week high of $50.37 on Feb 18, eventually closing at $50.32. The closing share price represents a one-year return of 28.6% and a year-to-date return of 9.5%. Average volume of shares traded over the last 10 days (5,548K) increased from the average volume of shares traded over the last three months (3,099k).Xilinx delivered positive earnings surprises in the last three quarters with an average beat of 5.4%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a market cap of $13.39 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.5%.The price appreciation can be attributed to the growing demand for Xilinx's 28 nanometer (nm) field programmable gate array (FPGAs) driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment. This has also enabled the company to surpass rival  (  ). During the third quarter of 2014, sales of these products came in at $100.0 million.We believe that the company's continued focus on margin expansion, cost reduction across its product portfolio and higher yield are positives. We also think that Xilinx's product launches will boost revenues.Xilinx reported mixed third-quarter results with the bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing. Both revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis. Both the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive segments contributed to the year-over-year increase in the top line.Xilinx provided a positive view for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis and expects favorable contributions from all end markets and the 28-nm portfolio. Xilinx also expects sales from mainstream products to be up on a sequential basis and its communications segment to continue to show strength due to the China LTE scenario. Considering all the above factors, Xilinx expects revenues to increase 2.0% to 6.0% on a sequential basis to $598.5 million-$622.0 million.Additionally, we are encouraged by Xilinx's endeavor to return shareholder value through continued share buybacks and dividend payouts. During the quarter, Xilinx repurchased shares worth $97.1 million and paid dividends of approximately $67.1 million to its shareholders. These investor-friendly initiatives not only boost earnings but also instill investor confidence and loyalty.Considering the growth potential and positive news flow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 was up significantly over the past 30 days. Thirteen estimates for 2014 were raised over the last 30 days, while three estimates for the fourth quarter of 2013 were lowered during the same period of time.Better-ranked stocks in the technology industry that are currently performing well and also have good visibility include  (  ) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and  (  ) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xilinx Shares Hit 52-Week High - Analyst Blog@2014-02-19@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-shares-hit-52-week-high-analyst-blog-2014-02-19
The semiconductor maker, Xilinx reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2015 results wherein its bottom-line results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but top-line misses the same. The company revealed that disappointing sales at communications and broadcast divisions has negatively impacted profitability during the quarter. Also, fourth-quarter revenue guidance was disappointing. However, the growing demand for 28-nm nodes driven by higher wireless deployments and strength in the wired communication segment are expected to remain the growth drivers. The company's product launches are also expected to boost revenues. However, delays in China LTE deployments and stiff competition from Altera remain near-term headwinds. Given these pros and cons we are reiterating our long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.Founded and incorporated in San Jose, CA in 1984, Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) designs and manufactures a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex-programmable logic devices (CPLDs). A programmable logic device is an integrated circuit that can be programmed in a laboratory to perform complex functions. The company provides solutions for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets, such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing.The company markets its products through direct sales force, an independent sales force and distributors located in and outside the United States. The focus of the direct sales force is to support all channels and make sure that the right solution has been chosen for a particular project. The independent sales force works with large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The distributors, among other things, address inventory and logistics issues of large OEMs.The company classifies its products into four categories:New Products include recent product offerings such as Virtex-7, Kintex-7, Zynq-7000, Virtex-6, Virtex-5, Kintex UltraScale and Spartan-6 products. This category contributed 37% of fiscal 2014 revenues (22% of total 2013 revenue), up 85% from the year-ago level. The improvement was mainly due to higher sales of 28-nanometer (nm) and 40-nm products.Mainstream Products include Virtex-5, Spartan-3 and CoolRunner-II product portfolios. Mainstream Products accounted for 34% of fiscal 2014 revenues (43% of total 2013 revenue) and down 14% year over year. The decline was mainly due to weaker demand for Virtex-5 and Spartan-3 products.Base Products consist of the Virtex-4, Virtex-E, Virtex-II, Spartan, Spartan-II, CoolRunner and XC9500 product portfolios. Base Products are older than Mainstream Products with demand generated generally by customers' oldest systems still in production. Base Products generated 26% of fiscal 2014 revenues (31% of total 2013 revenue), down 8% from the year-ago period. The decline was mainly due to lower demand for Virtex-2 and Virtex-4 products.Support Products include configuration products (PROMs), HardWire, software and support/services. Revenues from Support Products were 3% of fiscal 2014 revenues (4% of total 2013 revenue), down 3% from the year-ago level. Lower sales of PROM products led to the revenue decline.Xilinx sells its products to electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as Communications & Data Centers (wired and wireless), Industrial, Aerospace & Defense, Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive and Other (storage, servers and office automation).Revenues from the Communications & Data Center market were 45% of total 2014 revenue (46% in 2013) and up 8% year over year. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense contributed 36% (34% in 2013) and up 16%. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive revenues were 16% of total revenue (16% in 2013) and up 8% year over year. Other revenues were 3% (4% in 2013) and down 15%.In fiscal 2014, worldwide sales to distributors accounted for 56% of total revenue. The largest distributor was Avnet Inc., accounting for 46% of total 2014 sales, while no other distributor or individual contributed more than 10%.Xilinx faces stiff competition from PLD competitors such as Altera Corp., Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Microsemi Corp., and manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and ASSPs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

emiconductor chip giant  (  ) recently announced the addition of five 28 nm Cyclone V FPGA development kits to its portfolio. The new low-cost kits facilitate system design by allowing designers to cost-effectively integrate Cyclone V FPGAs.The five Cyclone V FPGAs (Field-programmable gate array) include Arrow BeMicro, TerASIC Cyclone, Altima Cyclone, EBV Elektronik GmbH and Mercury Code Cyclone V GX development kits that provide a quick and simple way to develop low-cost and low-power, system-level designs.The new kits will enable customers to quickly develop low-power video systems, which in turn will help Altera to increase its customer base, going forward. The deployment will also help Altera to strengthen its product portfolio and offer more comprehensive and high-value programmable solutions.Altera reported total revenue of $421.8 million in the second quarter of 2013, down 9.3% year over year. The weakness was across products applications and geographies with a few exceptions.Growth in 4G/LTE deployments in particular will increase demand for FPGAs, which will be beneficial for Altera.

In a settlement with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, JPMorgan Chase & Co will pay $100 million and admit wrongdoing in the 'London Whale' case. The fine is one of many the firm will face over the incident; not to mention the $23 billion the firm has set aside for legal fees as it is being investigated by US authorities and regulators in connection to the case. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher commented that big banks are to blame for crises and that they have been shielded from failure. He said banks should be forced to rely on equity and raise money in the stock market rather than borrowing. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the country is expecting to balance its budget by 2015 and that the government will introduce a new law which will require balanced budgets in ""normal times"".

(  ) is due to issue its quarterly earnings report after the close today. Given its history, traders can expect very active trading in the upcoming After-hours session immediately following the company's release of its quarterly earnings. An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in XLNX following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.Analysts at MidnightTrader have tracked how XLNX's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session. The result of that study is below.Over the last year, when shares of XLNX rose in the extended-hours session in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 50% of the time (2 out of the last 4 quarters) the stock posted additional gains in the following regular session by an average of 1.90%.Over the last year, when shares of XLNX dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, there is limited evidence to suggest a follow-through in the same direction the next day.Our analysis of over a decade of company specific earnings related news and price data on over 5,000 US companies demonstrates that earnings event related trading opportunities can exist for those trading in the after-hours and premarket sessions. Certain stocks demonstrate a historical tendency to either underprice or overreact to earnings news in the extended-hours (the time when companies typically release earnings) relative to the following regular session close.This report was created using historical data and analysis provided by the Midnight Trader Pro service at MidnightTrader.com.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Trade the Earnings: Xilinx Inc.@2013-10-16@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-earnings-xilinx-inc-2013-10-16
 's (  ) fourth-quarter 2013 earnings of $1.16 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 per share.FactSet reported revenues of $219.3 million, up 5.6% on a year-over-year basis, 5.1 percentage points of which was organic growth, with the balance from the StreetAccount acquisition. FactSet's revenues marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $219.0 million.During the quarter, FactSet's U.S. revenues grew 6.0% from the year-ago quarter to $149.9 million, while its non-U.S. revenues of $69.4 million were up 5.0% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from Europe and Asia Pacific recorded growth of 4% and 11%, respectively.FactSet added 60 new clients this quarter taking its clients tally to a total of 2500. The company retained 92% of clients, amounting to 95% of the Annual Subscription Value (ASV).The company's Annual Subscription Value (ASV) increased by $6.0 million and reached a total figure of $888.0 million on Aug 31, 2013. Nearly 82% of this total figure is generated from buy-side clients, with the rest coming from sell-side firms performing functions like Mergers & Acquisition advisory work and equity research.FactSet's operating expenses increased 8.6% from the year-ago quarter to $148.8 million primarily due to higher cost of services (up 11.0% year over year and increased 180 bps as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarter) and selling, general and administrative expenses (up 5.9% year over year and increased 10 bps as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarter). As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased 180 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.This increase in costs impacted operating income which was down marginally (down 0.1% on a year-over-year basis) while margins contracted 180 bps from the year-ago quarter to 32.2%.Net income during the quarter came in at $50.9 million, up 5.0% from the year-ago period while net margin for the quarter was 23.2% versus 23.4% in the year-ago quarter.FactSet exited the quarter with $196.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $242.8 million in the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt.FactSet generated free cash flow of $71.0 million during the quarter and purchased 1.4 million shares for $144.0 million.For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, FactSet expects revenues in the range of $222.0 million to $225.0 million. Apart from this, the operating margin is expected to range between 33.0% and 34.0%. While the GAAP earnings per share should range between $1.21 and $1.24 (GAAP diluted earnings per share presumes the enforcement of U.S. Federal R&D tax credit). Without the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit reinforcement, the GAAP earnings per share will be reduced by 3 cents.FactSet reported modest fourth-quarter 2013 results since revenues grew on a year-over-year basis but earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company provided a positive guidance for the forthcoming quarter. Moreover, the ASV increased compared to the year-ago quarter and FactSet added a good number of clients.FactSet continues to launch products and applications across its segments with special emphasis on financial services to gain more customers. Moreover, the company's acquisition of Revere Data will help it to deliver innovative products to its clients and evolve as a global financial database company. It will also help FactSet to maximize value for its partners and provide customers with exclusive content sets.Nonetheless, competition from Bloomberg L.P., Dow Jones & Company Inc.,  (  ) and Thomson Reuters, which are also coming up with substitute products at competitive prices, is a headwind for the company.FactSet carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

any stocks will reach their ex-dividend date next Monday, which is significant for investors as the seller of the stock on that date, not the buyer, receives the most recent dividend.A stock must be bought one day before the ex-dividend date to claim any dividends that have been announced but not yet paid. The company determines on the record date, which usually occurs two days after the ex-dividend date, which shareholders qualify for the dividend. Shareholders listed as holders of record after the record date then receive their dividend on the date of payment established by the company. Those purchasing right before the record date forfeit the dividend and normally get the stock for a reduced amount.It may seem an anachronism in this era of high frequency trading, but the dividend rate rules are in force since it can still take up to three business days for transactions to be credited to and settled in an investor's account.Below are five stocks that schedule August 5 as their ex-dividend date.

n Jul 5, 2013, we retained our Neutral recommendation on semiconductor chip-maker,  (  ). On Apr 24, Xilinx posted mixed first quarter 2013 results. Revenues declined on a year-over-year basis and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. But the quarter's adjusted earnings of 47 cents were better than the year-ago level and also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Xilinx delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last quarter, with an average beat of 5.95% for the trailing four quarters. Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Xilinx currently dominates the Programmable Logic Device (PLD) market with its 28 nanometer (nm) field programmable gate array (FPGA) products. The company has introduced a broad array of 28nm FPGA chips during fiscal 2013. The new product launches led Xilinx to generate better-than-expected revenues from the FPGA portfolio in the last quarter.Management expects 28-nm FPGA revenues to grow 150.0% year over year in fiscal 2014 based on continued ASIC and ASSP displacement and higher usage of FPGAs in next generation wireline & wireless networks and data centers. LTE deployments in the communications market will drive FPGA demand leading to continued momentum for Xilinx.Xilinx' leadership could get affected while transitioning to lower nodes. Though archrival Altera Corp. remained an underdog in the 28-nm transition, the trend could reverse in the case of 20-nm or 14-nm. Both the companies are planning to launch their 20-nm products shortly.Notably, Altera has started working on developing 14-nm FPGAs leveraging Intel Corp.'s tri-gate transistor technology. In response, Xilinx also announced its 16-nm plans in association with its foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Company.Over the last 30 days, estimates for 2013 and 2014 remained unchanged. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 and 2014 also remains unchanged at $2.00 and $2.30 per share, respectively.The lack of estimate revisions indicates that there are no drivers to move the stock in either direction.Other stocks in the technology sector that are currently performing well include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

"xcerpt from  by Sonny Kleinfield (1983):""I asked the obligatory question: How do you decide when to make a trade?"" ""Through experience,"" he says, propping his foot up on a small fold-out seat screwed to his post. ""Over the course of eighteen years as a specialist, I've had every type of experience - up market and down market, people getting shot, wars, you name it - and you learn how to react based on those experiences. I guess I've had everything happen, and I guess you store it in the computer in your head. You don't have a lot of time to decide, that's for sure. And you have to anticipate. You have to look at the tape and anticipate - two months or three months, maybe a day or so, maybe two or three seconds before someone else. That's what makes you a good trader... People talk a lot about their bellies. I guess that has something to do with it, too. You do feel something in your gut.""He clears his throat with a loud harrumph and goes on: ""You watch the tape. There's a talent to reading the tape. Later today, either the market is going to go further down or it's going to rally. It's down fourteen now, at eleven-thirty. You have to anticipate when the rally will start and end. An outsider looks and sees the market down six points for the day. A student of the market looks at what the market was doing over the course of the day. Here, we live and die by the moment. The market is constantly breathing during the day. You have to breathe with it and sense its pulse. That determines whether you're a successful trader or an unsuccessful trader.""Do you ever hold on to a bad trade and hope for a rebound? I ask. ""Live in hope,"" Milton says ruefully, ""and die in despair."" He goes on to say, ""You try to stretch your profits and limit your losses. The worst thing you can do in this business is try to protect a bad trade. You do this and they carry you out of here. This reminds me of the kid who (poops) in bed and gets it all over his legs trying to kick it out of the crib. You see, a bad trade is like a diseased piece of meat. You don't want it any more of it. Throw it away. Bury it. Burn it, just get the damned thing away from your mouth. When you're breaking in a new trader, the hardest thing to learn is to admit that you're wrong. It's a hard pill to swallow. You have to be man enough to admit to your peers that you are wrong and get out. Then you're alive and playing the game the next day. A lot of traders don't learn that and they fail."" , I asked myself the obligatory question: ""Did I make a bad trading decision by targeting mid-July through mid-August (with the date specific of July 19) as the timing point for the first meaningful decline of the year?"" The reason for said question was that every time the  (INDEXSP:.INX) sold off last week, buyers showed up to save the day. And the operative word is ""trading"" because that potential downside strategy was merely a short-term tactical call. Indeed, I continue to believe the odds are high that we are into a new secular bull market. Last week the media help raised my conviction level to ""There they go again,"" to quote a President from an era gone by. To be sure, ""There they go again"" as the recent pullback attempts have caused the media to trot out the usual ""Bear Boo"" suspects. The reason why is a mystery to me, because these broken-clock bears have been wrong for more than four years! Of course, I too have been called a broken-clock bull. Now anyone is entitled to be wrong -- Lord knows I have been wrong more than I care to admit -- but as my father used to say, ""If you think the equity markets are going up, be bullish, and if you think the markets are going down, be bearish.""Speaking of being wrong, I had thought that while this quarter's corporate earnings reports were going to look pretty good, the revenues reports would come up short. So far, that is just not the case with 56.3% of reporting companies beating their revenue estimates. Meanwhile, 65.2% have beaten their earnings estimates for the best reporting season since 4Q10. As for the sectors doing the best on the earnings front, technology (+71.3%), industrials (+68.7%), and financials (+67.9%) have the best beat rates, while utilities (+22.2%), telecom (+33.3%), and materials (+51.0%) have done the worst. By my work, the only sectors  currently overbought, on a short/intermediate-term basis, are materials, technology, and telecom.As for individual companies beating their estimated earnings/revenue estimates, and guiding future earnings estimates higher, six favorably rated companies from the Raymond James research universe have hit my screens. They are, in no particular order:  (  );  (  );  (  );  (  );  (  ); and  (AMD). My firm offers these names for your potential ""buy list,"" especially if we get the envisioned 10% pullback.This week, we'll get a barrage of economic reports having the potential of a negative impact on the equity markets. Today we get the pending home sales (-1.0e), and on Tuesday, we get the S&P/Case-Shiller (+1.45) and the consumer confidence (81.0e) reports. Wednesday ushers in the ADP Employment (180Ke), Q2 GDP annualized (+1.0%e), the GDP Price Index (+1.1e), the Core PCE (+1.0e), the Chicago PMI (54.0e), and the FOMC interest rate decision. Thursday sees the release of the initial jobless claims (+345Ke), the ISM Manufacturing (52.0e), the ISM Prices Paid (54.0e), and the total vehicle sales (15.8Me), and then on Friday, we'll get the all-important employment data.As for the here and now, at the beginning of this missive, I asked the obligatory question: ""Did I make a bad trading decision by targeting the mid-July through mid-August timeframe (with the date specific of July 19) as the timing point for the first meaningful decline of the year?"" Given the weight of the evidence, I am sticking with that ""call."" To recap a few of those ""evidences"" mentioned over the past few weeks: We had a 7.5% decline in the SPX between May 22 and June 24 that was accompanied by a much more severe ~17% decline in the NYSE Advance/Decline Line; for the last 10 years between mid-July and early August, nine of the 10 S&P macro sectors have declined; the SPX has been making new rally highs without a similar expansion in new yearly highs for stocks (at the May 21 high, there were 536 new 52-week new highs; last Monday, there were 325); when they start ""running"" the laggards, it's time to look over your shoulder; the 14-day Stochastic Indicator has fallen below its moving average; and the list goes on. So, the weight of the evidence continues to suggest caution until the mid-July into mid-August point of vulnerability passes. On Friday, July 19 (D-Day), the SPX closed at 1692.09. The following Monday, it closed at 1695.53 and then at 1692.39 on Tuesday. Subsequently, the SPX has not been able to recapture those highs. Anybody that follows  knows that such D-Day ""calls"" have a tracking error of one to three days. Also worth remembering is that I have always thought the SPX could travel into the 1700 - 1730 level before any meaningful decline begins. Whether that happens remains to be seen, but so far, the SPX has been merely ""hanging on,"" but I think its ""hanging"" remains on borrowed time. Whatever the near-term resolution, I know old traders, and I know bold traders, but I know no old and bold traders! Be cautious, my friends.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@Jeff Saut to US Investors: Proceed With Caution@2013-07-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jeff-saut-us-investors-proceed-caution-2013-07-29
 (  ) reported earnings of 31 cents per share in the second quarter of 2013, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Altera reported total revenue of $421.8 million in the second quarter, down 9.3% year over but up 2.7% sequentially. The quarter's revenues came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $425.0 million and were within management's guidance range of flat to up 4.0% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was mainly due to weakness in mainstream and matured products, almost all the end-markets (barring auto, industrial & military) and the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions.Sales of new products grew 20.0% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues from mainstream and mature products declined 14.0% and 28.0%, respectively.Geographically, revenues from Americas and Asia-Pacific declined 12.0% and 22.0%, respectively on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Japan grew 11.0% and 2.0%, respectively. On an end-market basis; telecom and wireless declined 16.0%, networking, computer & storage decreased 6.0% and the Other category declined 8%. However, the automotive, broadcast, military end market posted 2.0% growth.Sequentially, Altera witnessed solid performances from all the geographical regions (except Americas), product category and end markets.Gross margin came in at 68.0%, down from 69.6% in the year-ago quarter and within management's expected range. Operating margin came in at 26.6%, down from 34.3% in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses grew 6.2% year over year, reflecting 8.5% growth in sales and marketing expenses and 3.6% increase in research and development expenses.Reported net income was $101.5 million or 31 cents per share compared with $162.7 million or 50 cents per share in the second quarter of 2012.Altera exited the quarter with a cash and short-term investment balance of $2.95 billion and operating cash of $64.5 million. Capital expenditure was $8.7 million.Altera spent $54.9 million for repurchasing shares and roughly $32.0 million for paying dividend.Altera expects sales to grow 5.0%-9.0% sequentially in the third quarter of 2013. The revenue improvement could be due to an expected turnaround in telecom & wireless, auto, industrial & military and networking & storage end markets. The Others category is expected to remain flat sequentially.Management projects gross margin of roughly 68.0% in the third quarter, in line with the second quarter. Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $99.0 million to $101.0 million, while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses will range between $80.0 million and $82.0 million. Tax rate is expected in the range of 12.0%-13.0%.Altera has delivered mixed second quarter 2013 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Overall year-over-year performances were weak while sequential performances provided some hope. Guidance for the upcoming quarter was encouraging, citing some turnaround in the end markets.Last week, Altera's archrival  (  ) reported impressive first quarter 2014 results and provided a better sequential expectation for the second quarter citing higher revenues from all geographic regions, better demand situation for its 28nm node products and expected traction in its 20nm products, which are ready to be shipped. Xilinx also announced its extended partnership with foundry partner  (  ) for transition into 16nm nodes by 2014.Though Altera's association with chip maker  (  ) will keep it ahead of its peers, synergies from the partnership is not likely to boost fundamentals in the near term.

 (  ) -- currently residing at $20.10 -- has tacked on a whopping 114.7% since hitting its 52-week low of $9.57 on December 5, leading to a heap of bullish betting in its options pits. Throughout the last 50 sessions, speculators have bought to open almost five calls for every put, according to the stock's International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (  ), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) 50-day call/put volume ratio of 4.67. Moreover, this ratio ranks higher than 97% of other such readings taken within the year, meaning speculators have snatched up calls over puts at a near-annual-high rate during the time frame.Still, SNE experienced a change of pace in its options pits yesterday, as 9,137 puts -- two times the daily norm -- changed hands, compared to only 5,404 calls. Much of this traffic passed through at the July 20 put, where 3,601 contracts crossed for a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $0.87. Almost all of the contracts went off at the ask price, and open interest added 2,443 positions over night, pointing to heavy buy-to-open activity.Yesterday's put buyers anticipate SNE will fall south of its 40-day moving average at $19.46, which has acted as nearly constant support since early December. Even more, these bearish speculators expect the stock to drop at least 7% to finish below the breakeven price of $19.13 (strike price less the VWAP) by July 19, when back-month options expire. If SNE instead lingers above the 20 strike, the most yesterday's put buyers stand to lose is the initial premium paid per contract.Stepping out of the options pits, analysts' consensus 12-month price target for SNE hovers at $25.62, which represents expected upside of 9.6% from the stock's 52-week high of $23.38. Should Sony Corporation tumble, as yesterday's call buyers anticipate, a round of price cuts could be in store, pushing the stock downward.

 (  ) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 47 cents in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents and the year-ago earnings of 44 cents a share.Xilinx generated total revenue of $532.2 million, down 4.8% from the year-ago quarter but up 4.3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to weaker-than-anticipated sales from Industrial, Aerospace & Defense and Consumer & Automotive end markets, partially offset by better performance in the Communications & Data Center end markets.Year over year, North America, Europe and Japan declined 7.0%, 9.0% and 10.0%, respectively, while Asia Pacific grew 3.0%. New product sales increased 86.0% year over year, driven by higher sales of Kintex-7 and Virtex-7 FPGAs. The company stated that its 28 nanometer families gained much traction during the quarter. But the company generated soft revenues from Mainstream and Base products.Gross margin inched down to 66.1% from 66.4% in the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to continued focus on yield improvement, cost reduction and favorable customer mix. Operating margin increased to 27.7% from 26.4% in the year-ago quarter due to lower expenses.

 (  ) reported earnings of 37 cents per share in the first quarter of 2013, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.Altera reported total revenue of $410.5 million in the first quarter, up 7.0% year over. The quarter's revenues came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $427.0 million and were within management's sequential decline guidance range of 4.0%-8.0%. The year-over-year improvement was mainly due to solid contribution from the Americas, Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EMEA) region as well as higher sales of new products.Sales of new products grew 64.0% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues from mainstream and mature products declined 3.0% and 20.0%, respectively.Geographically, revenues from EMEA and Americas grew 22.0% and 21.0%, respectively on a year-over-year basis. Revenues from Asia-Pacific and Japan fell 3.0% each. On an end-market basis; networking, computer & storage recorded high double-digits growth, followed by high-single digit growth in telecom and wireless and low single-digit growth in automotive, broadcast, military and others.Sequentially, Altera witnessed lackluster performance from all the geographical regions, product category and end markets.Gross margin came in at 69.3%, down from 70.1% in the year-ago quarter and within management's guided range. Operating margin came in at 28.7%, down from 30.4% in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses grew 9.5% year over year, reflecting higher sales and marketing expenses.Reported net income was $120.2 million or 37 cents per share compared with $115.8 million or 35 cents per share in the first quarter of 2012.Altera exited the quarter with cash and short-term investment balance of $3.12 billion and operating cash of $149.5 million. Capital expenditure was $14.6 million.Altera did not make any share repurchases during the quarter. The company declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, which will be paid on Jun 3 to stockholders of record as of May 10.Altera expects sales to be flat to up 4.0% sequentially in the second quarter of 2013. The revenue improvement could be due to an expected turnaround in telecom & wireless as well as auto, industrial, and military end markets. Networking and storage end markets are expected to lag. The Others category is expected to remain flat sequentially.Management projects gross margin of 69% (+/- 0.5%) in the second quarter, roughly in line with the first quarter. Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $97.0 million to $99 million, while SG&A will range between $77 million and $79 million. Tax rate is expected in the range of 12.0%-13.0%.Altera has delivered mixed first-quarter 2013 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. However, revenues grew year over year with support from geographical contributions, decent end-market performance and higher sales of new products. Guidance was encouraging citing some turnaround in the end markets barring networking & storage end markets.Altera's archrival  (  ) also reported modest results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and provided a better guidance for the first quarter citing higher revenues from all geographic regions, better demand situation for its 28nm node products and expected traction in its 20nm products, which are ready to be shipped.Though Altera's association with chip maker  (  ) will keep it ahead of its peers, synergies from the partnership is not likely to boost fundamentals in the near term.Currently, Altera holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

hares of  (  ) reached a new 52-week high of $40.33 on Tuesday, May 28, 2013 following a strategic collaboration, industry recognition and decent fourth quarter 2013 results announced on Apr 24.The closing price of the technology services provider on May 28 was $39.96, representing a solid one-year return of about 22.76% and a decent year-to-date return of about 7.74%. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months stands at approximately 3049K.Xilinx delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.95%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a market cap of $10.5 billion and a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.0%.Last week, Xilinx announced a collaboration with electric wire and optical fiber cables manufacturer Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. The alliance will allow Xilinx to deliver an advanced and cost effective solution (SmartCORE IP) for the wireless communication end market.The communications end market happens to be the largest end market for Xilinx and currently the ramp in 4G LTE deployments is creating a growth opportunity for Xilinx (4G base stations prefer using FPGAs). We believe that with the SmartCORE IP solution, Xilinx's share in the wireless communication market will grow.In another development, Xilinx announced that its 7 series FPGAs and Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoCs (system on chips) have received approval from PCI-SIG (Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group) and become PCI Express compliant. The PCI-SIG is an electronics industry consortium responsible for specifying the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), PCI-X, and PCI Express (PCIe) computer buses.With this, Xilinx's 7 series FPGAs and Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoCs will be compliant with PCIe Gen 2 and Gen 3 specifications.Xilinx reported adjusted earnings of 47 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4% and the year-ago quarter by 6.4%. The beat was mainly attributable to tight cost control and lower tax rate.Revenues of $532.2 billion fell 4.8% year over year due to weaker-than-anticipated sales from Industrial, Aerospace & Defense and Consumer & Automotive end markets, partially offset by better performance in the Communications & Data Center end markets. However, Xilinx witnessed sequential revenue growth.New product sales increased 86.0% year over year, driven by higher sales of Kintex-7 and Virtex-7 FPGAs. Xilinx stated that its 28 nanometer families gained much traction during the quarter. But the company generated soft revenues from Mainstream and Base products.Xilinx provided a positive view for the next quarter and expects favorable contributions from all end markets and 28-nm portfolio. Xilinx also announced plans to ship 20-nm product portfolio, including the next-generation 8 series All Programmable FPGAs and second generation of 3D ICs and SoCs by the June quarter.Despite growth potential and positive news flow, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2014 and 2015 remained unchanged at $2.00 and $2.30, respectively over the past 30 days. This was mainly due to some positive estimate revisions, offset by some negative estimate revisions. Two estimates each were revised upward for fiscal 2014 and 2015 in the last 30 days, while 4 estimates and 2 estimates were revised downwards for 2014 and 2015, respectively.Downward revisions could reflect some weakness in the Industrial, aerospace and defense and communications end markets.Xilinx's leadership in 28nm nodes is encouraging. Also, the shipment of 20nm nodes and expected recovery in the semiconductor market are catalysts.Other stocks in the technology industry that are currently performing well and have a good visibility include  (  ),  (  ), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and  (  ), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xilinx Touches New 52-Week High - Analyst Blog@2013-05-29@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-touches-new-52-week-high-analyst-blog-2013-05-29

 recent survey by The Online Investor (published by Forbes) revealed that  (  ) has toppled  (  ) to take over the #316 spot in terms of market capitalization.We believe that Western Digital is reasonably priced in the $37.0 to $38.0 range. Further, it has the potential for some upward movement considering the kind of benefits that it can derive from the adoption of cloud computing. .Companies across the world will prefer cloud computing as it provides the cheapest option for data storage with quick access. This data will be stored at an offsite server, which in turn would require huge data storage capacity. Here lies the opportunity for companies like Western Digital  (  ) and  (  ). Sensing this opportunity the company is making some marketing moves to tap this opportunity.Moreover, Western Digital is coming up with a host of hardware and software solutions, which are particularly designed to make storage easier and more readily available. Additionally, we believe that after the acquisition of Viviti Technologies (formerly Hitachi GST) for $3.9 billion in cash and 25 million shares of the company, WDC has strengthened its foothold in the data storage business. Although the brands compete separately in the market, the deal should strengthen the company's revenue base in the future.On the other hand, the softness in PC demand may affect the business. Although the company has been able to handle competition efficiently, bigger players like Fujitsu Ltd, Samsung and Toshiba pose considerable challenges.Separately, the benefits achieved from higher ASPs due to tight supply of hard disk drives (HDDs), resulting from the disruption caused by the Thailand flood, are exhausting. This is due to normalization of supply/demand metrics. This has been reflected in the company's second quarter guidance, which is sequentially weak. However, management believes that new product launches, further cost optimization, strategic allocation of capital and efficient execution will drive customers.Currently, Western Digital has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@WDC has Reasons to Cheer - Analyst Blog@2012-12-11@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wdc-has-reasons-to-cheer-analyst-blog-2012-12-11
 (  ) reported earnings of 37 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2012, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.The quarter's miss and a weak guidance resulted in a 6.2% decline in share price in after-hours trading.Altera reported total revenue of $439.4 million in the fourth quarter, down 4.0% year over. The quarter's revenue came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $451.0 million but was better than management's sequential decline guidance of 6.0% - 10%. Weak sales of mainstream and mature products outweighed strong new product sales.Geographically, all regions posted year-over-year declines, barring Europe, Middle East & Africa region. The revenue improvement in Europe was mainly due to a major customer win. On an end-market basis; automotive, broadcast, military and networking fell double digits on a percentage basis. Contributions from Telecom and Wireless end market and Computer and Storage end market remained flat year over year.Gross margin came in at 69.7%, down from 70.1% in the year-ago quarter and slightly below management's guidance. This was primarily due to unfavorable customer mix in the wireless and wireline markets. Operating margin came in at 31.4%, down from 35.0% in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses grew 1.3% year over year, reflecting modest cost reduction initiatives.Reported net income was $120.8 million or 37 cents per share compared with $146.6 million or 45 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2011.Altera exited the quarter with a cash and short-term investment balance of $3.02 billion and operating cash of $126.7 million. Capital expenditure was $7.2 million.Altera repurchased 1.6 million shares in the quarter for $50.0 million. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, which will be paid on Mar 1 to stockholders of record as of Feb 11.Altera expects sales to be down 4% - 8% sequentially in the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to continuous weak performances across end markets and a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) arrangement signed with one of the customers. Under this arrangement, Altera could only replenish the customer's stock after its exhaustion. The procedure, though beneficial for both the parties, will delay revenue recognition.Altera continues to see traction in the 28-nanometer as well as 40-nanometer nodes.Management projects gross margin of 69% - 70% in the first quarter, roughly in line with the fourth quarter.Altera has delivered disappointing fourth quarter 2013 results with EPS and revenue missing the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Broad-based revenue weaknesses were noticed across the end markets and geographical regions. Guidance was disappointing. The only positive was strong sales of new products, which however will be not enough to give the fundamentals a boost in the near term.Last week, Altera's archrival  (  ) reported modest results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and provided a better guidance for the fourth quarter citing higher revenues from all geographic regions and better demand situation for its 28NM node products.Currently, Altera holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

 (  ) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 38 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2013, inching past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, quarterly earnings failed to surpass the year-ago earnings of 47 cents a share.The company generated total revenue of $509.8 million, slightly down from $511.1 million in the year-ago quarter but better than the management's guidance of down 1.0%-5.0%. The overall decline was due to weaker-than-anticipated sales from Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive end market and Communications & Data Center end market, offset somewhat by better-than-expected sales from Industrial and Aerospace and Defense end markets.Year over year, North America remained flat, Asia-Pacific fell 3.0%, while Europe and Japan grew 1.0% and 5.0%, respectively. New product sales increased 79.0% year over year, driven by higher sales of Kintex-7 and Virtex-6 FPGAs. The company reported that its 28 nanometer families gained much traction during the quarter. But the company generated soft revenues from Mainstream and Base products.Gross margin increased to 66.6% from 65.8% in the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to continued focus on yield improvement and cost reduction and favorable customer mix. Operating margin decreased to 23.7% from 26.8% in the year-ago quarter due to higher research and development expenses.During the quarter, Xilinx generated $122.6 million of cash from operations and incurred $8.1 million in capital expenditure. Xilinx paid $57.3 million in cash dividends. Xilinx ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term investments of $1.7 billion, flat sequentially.Xilinx stated that the backlog entering into the fourth quarter was up sequentially. The company also expects revenues from all the end markets and 28-nanometer products to increase sequentially. Consequently, Xilinx expects sales to be up 2% to 6% sequentially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 with support from higher revenues from all geographic regions.Gross margin is forecasted around 66%. Operating expenses in the March quarter are expected to be approximately $208.0 million, including approximately $2.0 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense is expected to be $7 million. Fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately 274 million. Effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 13 - 14%.Xilinx's third quarter results were decent with bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both revenue and EPS came below the year-ago level. However, the fourth quarter guidance was encouraging, which reflected some recovery in the semiconductor market on the back of expected higher spending.The company's transition into 28nm nodes is turning out to be positive and there is possibility for Xilinx to outperform the market going forward. But stiff competition from  (  ), gloomy semiconductor outlook for 2012 predicted by IT research firm Gartner Inc. and dwindling PC (significant consumer for semiconductor chips) market keeps us concerned for the near term.Currently, Xilinx has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

ecently,  (  ) reduced its revenue expectations for the fourth quarter of 2012. Following the news, the company's shares fell 1.86% to $4.23 after the markets closed on Wednesday.The chipmaker now expects sales to be down 6%-8% sequentially versus its previous guidance of plus or minus 2% sequentially.Management expects revenue to decline on account of weakness in the communications market combined with continued softness in the worldwide distribution channel. The communications market represented approximately 47% of the company's third quarter revenue and decreased 7.8% sequentially.However, the company maintained its gross margin guidance of 53% (+/-2%) and total operating expenses guidance of approximately $43 million, which includes approximately $5.5 million of restructuring charges.Recently, the company has taken steps to restructure its sales and marketing functions, which will reduce operational spending by approximately $12 million annually. The company expects to incur total restructuring charges of approximately 6 million, of which $5.5 million will be recognized in the fourth quarter.It is imperative that Lattice continues to undertake various initiatives and develop new products, keeping in mind the interest of the organization in both the long and short run. We believe the restructuring action and new products in both consumer and non-consumer segments will bring in stability and steady earnings growth in the near future.Lattice Semiconductor designs, develops and markets high performance programmable logic devices and related development system software. The company's third quarter revenue was down 13.2% from the year-ago period to $70.9 million due to lower programmable logic devices (PLD) revenue. However, revenue for field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) surged 24.8% year over year to $26.1 million.The company is likely to report its third-quarter results on January 24.Currently, Lattice Instruments has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). We note that its rival,  (  ) also carries a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) while  . (  ) carries a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Lattice Trims Rev View, Shares Dip - Analyst Blog@2012-12-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lattice-trims-rev-view-shares-dip-analyst-blog-2012-12-13
n January 12, 2013, Zacks  downgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Altera has witnessed sharp downward estimate revisions after its modest third quarter 2012 results and lowering of revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. The shares of this Logic device manufacturer have been range bound since October. Additionally, given its expected revenue decline in the upcoming quarter, the shares have downside risk.On October 23, 2012, Altera reported third quarter earnings per share of 49 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5% but down 14.0% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues dropped 5.0% from the year-ago quarter.On December 4, 2012, the company announced that it expects revenue for the fourth quarter to decline 8.0%-10.0% sequentially (previously 6.0%-10.0%). The company believes that weak sales of legacy products will likely offset the increasing sales of new products. The company also expects operating expenses to grow sequentially.Above all, Gartner's prediction for a 3.0% decline in the semiconductor market in 2012 and dwindling PC market are concerns.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 decreased 0.6% to $1.73 per share over the last 60 days. For 2013, most of the estimates were lowered over the last 60 days, which pulled down the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.9% to $1.76 per share. Over the last 90 days, estimates for 2012 and 2013 dropped 3.4% and 16.2%, respectively.Altera operates in the semiconductor industry and is a key player in the programmable logic devices (PLDs) market. Altera shares its PLD space with  (  ) and the two companies jointly hold roughly 85.0% market share.Not all semiconductor stocks are performing as poorly as Altera. We recommend  (  ), which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  (  ) and  (  ), which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) are also looking good at present.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Altera Downgraded to Strong Sell - Analyst Blog@2013-01-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/altera-downgraded-to-strong-sell-analyst-blog-2013-01-15
ecently,  (  ) and  (  ) have entered into a contract for jointly creating an embedded software development toolkit, Development Studio 5 (DS-5). The latest toolkit, which has a facility of FPGA-adaptive debug system, is designed particularly for Altera SoC tools.The ARM DS-5 Altera Edition toolkit has been introduced particularly for eliminating any kind of debugging difficulty and enhancing the visibility of debugging process within integrated dual-core CPU subsystem and FPGA processes. The kit will be added to the company's Altera SoC Embedded Design Suite profile.The latest kit is expected to offer a unique integration platform for Altera 28 nm Cyclone V, Arria V SoC tools and Altera 20 nm SoC devices. Altera and ARM have developed this toolkit in order to enhance the efficacy of its clients through easy integration of CPU as well as FPGA debugging.Management was highly enthusiastic regarding its venture with ARM. Now, with the introduction of this toolkit, the software engineers can easily access a highly developed debugging tool for augmenting the productivity of SoC devices.Earlier, Altera reported a net income of 49 cents per share in the third quarter of 2012, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents per share. However, the reported net income compares unfavorably with 50 cents per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 and 57 cents per share in the third quarter of 2011. The company has posted sales of $495.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, down 5% year over year but up 6% sequentially.Recently, the company trimmed its revenue guidance for fourth quarter 2012 and updated its financial guidance for 2013. Altera now expects revenue to be 8% to 10% lower than the third-quarter levels, compared to the previous guidance of down 6% to 10%. The solid growth in new products will be more than offset by lower sales of the company's existing products.Meanwhile, for 2013, gross margin is targeted around 69% - 70%. Research and development expense is estimated at approximately $104 million, driven by increased variable compensation expense and stock-based compensation. SG&A is likely to come around $315 million on the back of variable compensation for bonus, sales commission and stock-based compensation.In a different story, the company's prime rival,  (  ), seems to have gained traction and has won back its lost market share over the past few months. This does not bode well for Altera in the coming quarters.The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for Altera are 39 cents and $1.73 for the fourth quarter of 2012 and for the full year of 2012, respectively. The estimates represent year-over-year growth of (13.0%) for the fourth quarter of 2012 and (26.3%) for 2012.As the macroeconomic conditions continue to be challenging, we prefer to have a Zacks #4 Rank on the stock, which translates into a short-term rating of 'Sell'. In the long run, we have an 'Underperform' recommendation on the stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Altera and ARM Join Forces - Analyst Blog@2012-12-17@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/altera-and-arm-join-forces-analyst-blog-2012-12-17
e recently upgraded our recommendation on programmable logic devices maker  . ( XLNX) to Neutral from Underperform.Xilinx is uniquely positioned to capitalize on incremental growth opportunities presented by its leadership in 28nm products and innovative platform-based architectures. The ramp up in 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer products will create a host of new opportunities, and replacement of ASICs will take place in a more aggressive way. 28-nanometer sales showed solid growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.The company reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Xilinx reported earnings per share of 46 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. However, the quarterly earnings failed to surpass the year-ago earnings as well as the prior quarter earnings of 47 cents a share. Net income declined 5% sequentially and 2% year over year to $123.4 million.However, earnings estimates for Xilinx have declined significantly owing to the soft guidance provided by the company. Xilinx stated that the backlog entering into the December quarter was down on a sequential basis.In addition, management estimates that continued macroeconomic uncertainty may result in unpredictable customer ordering patterns. Sales of base and mainstream products are likely to decline.Nevertheless, Xilinx, which competes with  (  ), expects continued growth from new products. However, Xilinx expects sales to be down 1% to 5% sequentially in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and sales from all geographies are projected to decrease.Most analysts covering the stock have reduced their estimates following the results leading to a fall in estimates for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014.Owing to the uncertain business environment, Xilinx is taking steps to reduce headcount and lower discretionary spending. We also expect margins to improve as the company starts executing better with TSMC as its foundry partner. The shift to TSMC should lower operating expenses as well.We expect the communications market to be the growth driver in the coming quarters, propelled by accelerating LTE deployments across the world. The company has most recently won its first major design win at Huawei. We expect Xilinx to win some of its lost market share from Altera .Our Neutral recommendation is supported by a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term rating of Hold.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xilinx Upgraded to Neutral - Analyst Blog@2012-12-13@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-upgraded-to-neutral-analyst-blog-2012-12-13
hipmaker  (  ) recently trimmed its revenue guidance for fourth quarter 2012 and updated its financial guidance for 2013.Altera now expects revenue to be 8% to 10% lower than the third-quarter levels, compared to the previous guidance of down 6% to 10%.This translates into revenues of $445.5 million - $465.3 million, down from the previous estimate of $455.4 million - $465.3 million.The solid growth in new products will be more than offset by lower sales of the company's existing products.Meanwhile, for 2013, gross margin is targeted around 69% - 70%. Research and Development is estimated at approximately $104 million, driven by increased variable compensation expense and stock-based compensation. SG&A is likely to come around $315 million on the back of variable compensation for bonus, sales commission and stock-based compensation.Other Income/Expense is projected at $1 million. Tax rate is expected to be 13%. Capital expense is expected to be $65 million.Earlier, Altera reported a net income of $157.5 million or 49 cents per share in the third quarter of 2012, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents per share.Altera reported sales of $495.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, down 5% year over year but up 6% sequentially.However, earnings estimates plummeted as most analysts covering the stock have lowered their guidance. We expect a further drop in estimates as management trimmed their estimates.The reduction in guidance has led to a 0.16% fall in stock price in after hours trading. Meanwhile, Altera and its prime rival  (  ) together hold nearly 87% of the PLD market. However, Xilinx seems to have gained traction and has won back its lost market share over the past few months. This does not bode well for Altera in the coming quarters.Margins have already peaked and it might not be sustainable in the long run. Hence, owing to the macroeconomic weakness, we had earlier downgraded our recommendation to Underperform from Neutral.Our Underperform recommendation is supported by a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term rating of Sell.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Altera Trims Outlook, Shares Fall - Analyst Blog@2012-12-05@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/altera-trims-outlook-shares-fall-analyst-blog-2012-12-05
arnings estimates for chipmaker  (  ) have declined significantly after the company provided soft guidance for the fourth quarter of 2012 despite reporting better-than-expected results in the third quarter.Altera reported a net income of $157.5 million or 49 cents per share in the third quarter of 2012, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents per share.Altera reported sales of $495.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, down 5% year over year but up 6% sequentially.However, Altera expects sales to be down 6% - 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2012. This implies a revenue guidance of $445.5 million - $465.3 million.The weak guidance prompted the majority of the analysts covering the stock to lower their estimates for 2012 and 2013.For 2012, as many as 20 out of 21 analysts have reduced their forecast leading to a 5 cent decline in earnings estimates.For 2013, the decline is steeper as 19 out of the 21 analysts have lowered their projections, leading to a 24 cent decline in the earnings estimates.For the fourth quarter of 2012, 19 out of the 21 analysts cut their estimates, leading to an 8 cent decline in earnings estimates.Management attributed the weakness in guidance to lower demand from two prime customers. One customer in the mainstream category products converted a high-volume design last year to an ASIC but recently discovered a technical limitation in the device, which required the customer to fill the gap with product from Altera in the third quarter.The second customer has converted 2 high-volume designs, one in networking and one in wireless, both mainstream products from Altera to ASICs, amounting to approximately 4% of revenue in the third quarter.Excluding these conversions, Altera projected a sequential decline of 1% to 5%, driven by the overall weak economic environment impacting all major market segments. Management projects gross margin of 69% - 70% in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the third quarter.Altera and its prime rival  (  ) together hold nearly 87% of the PLD market.

 (  ) reported a net income of $157.5 million or 49 cents per share in the third quarter of 2012, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents per share.However, the reported net income compares unfavorably with $162.7 million or 50 cents per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 and a net income of $185.4 million or 57 cents per share in the third quarter of 2011.Altera reported sales of $495.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, down 5% year over year but up 6% sequentially.Reported revenues, however, came in toward the higher end of management's sequential growth guidance of 2% - 6%.On an end-market basis; automotive, broadcast, military and networking grew double digits on a percentage basis.Altera posted healthy growth in both its new and mainstream product categories, which increased 8% and 13%, respectively. Revenue at the 40-nanometer node increased by 8% and continues to be the single largest revenue node for the second straight quarter.Revenue for the 28-nanometer node more than doubled to $18.1 million but was short of management's target of $20 million. Altera had over $4 million worth 28-nanometer demand, which could not be shipped due to product mix.Book-to-bill remained below one in the third quarter as well.Gross margin came in at 69.3%, down from 69.6% in the previous quarter and 68.0% in the year-ago quarter and below management's guidance. This was primarily due to the unfavorable customer mix in the wireless and wireline market. Operating margin came in at 35.8%, up from 34.3% in the previous quarter but down from 39.3% in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, the company's board declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, which will be paid on December 3, 2012 to stockholders of record as of November 13, 2012.During the quarter, Altera repurchased 1.6 million shares in the quarter for $50.0 million. Altera ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments, down from $3.3 billion at the end of December 2011.Altera expects sales to be down 6% - 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower demand from two prime customers. This implies a revenue guidance of $445.5 million - $465.3 million.One customer in the mainstream category products converted a high-volume design last year to an ASIC but recently discovered a technical limitation in the device which required the customer to fill the gap with product from Altera in the third quarter.Altera continues to see traction in the 28-nanometer node and expects revenue from this node to exceed $20 million in the third quarter. Revenue from 40-nanometer node is expected to grow again sequentially.The second customer has converted 2 high-volume designs, one in networking and one in wireless, both mainstream products from Altera to ASICs, amounting to approximately 4% of revenue in the third quarter.Excluding these conversions, Altera would have expected a sequential decline of 1% to 5%, driven by the overall weak economic environment impacting all major market segments.Nevertheless, the loss of 2 designs to ASICs at the company's largest customer has been partially offset by market share gains with other customers.Management projects gross margin of 69% - 70% in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the third quarter.The weak guidance drove a 2.15% decline in share price in after-hours trading to close at $31.92. In regular trading, shares were down 0.91% to close at $32.62.Last week, prime rival,  (  ) also reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 but provided a weak guidance for the December quarter due to continued macroeconomic uncertainty.We continue to maintain a Neutral recommendation on Altera. Our long-term recommendation is supported by a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term rating of Hold.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Altera Beats in 3Q, Guides Weak - Analyst Blog@2012-10-24@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/altera-beats-in-3q-guides-weak-analyst-blog-2012-10-24

"uring the past 10 years, the besthedge funds have consistently produced market-beating returns, driving huge capital inflows into the industry and making hedge funds one of the hottestinvestments on the Street.Take John Paulson for example. The hedge-fund billionaire became a legend in 2008, when it was revealed he made billions for himself and his investors in 2007 after initiating huge short positions in housingstocks . He followed that up by shorting bank stocks in 2008, producing a 19% return for his investors while the S&P 500 continued to plummet.David Einhorn has produced equally impressive results. Since launching Greenlight Capital in 1996, the fellow billionaire hedge-fund manager has produced an average annual return of 20%, crushing the S&P 500 and most of his hedge-fund competitors.But unfortunately, most investorswill never have access to these exoticinvestment vehicles.Hedge funds are extremely exclusive investment instruments, offered only to accredited investors who have income of more than $250,000 and anet worth north of $1 million. Hedge funds are also insanely expensive. They frequently charge investors 2% ofassets under management (AUM) and take 20% of annual profits, regardless of whether thefund outperforms the S&P 500. In addition, they also frequently have lock-in periods, preventing investors from accessing invested capital for years at a time. So even though the smartestmoney on the Street has a history of picking good stocks, access to institutional-class investments also comes with a few pitfalls.That's why I am such a big fan of tracking what these hedge funds own. Trackinginstitutional ownership is like having access to the smartest hedge funds in the world without having to pay a fee, give up any profits or participate in restrictive lock-in policies.Big institutions such as hedge funds,mutual funds and endowments have better tools and information that enable them to sniff out big winners. They also frequently benefit from the momentum they create after buying huge blocks of stocks.In the old days, tracking what hedge funds owned was hard to come by. It was either far too expensive for regular investors to access this information, or it would be buried in a pile of paperwork from the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission , intimidating even the most seasoned forensicaccountant . But through advancements in technology, this kind of information is now easily accessed through public channels such as Reuters or Bloomberg.And that's exactly how I recently come up a list of the 10 stocks with the highest level of institutional ownership in the S&P 500...Of these 10 stocks, two stand out as my favorites. Here they
are...Of these 10 stocks, two stand out as my favorites. Here they are... Market cap : $59 billion1-year gain: 72.8%Institutional ownership: 98.94%This biotechnology company specializes in developing therapeutics for the treatment of life-threatening diseases such as HIV and hepatitis B. The company is also massive, with amarket cap of $59 billion. But that hasn't stopped smart money from loading up onshares , with a staggering 98.9% institutional ownership.This interest from the biggest investors on the Street has lifted Gilead to an amazing 72.8% gain in the past year and 112% in the past two. But in spite of these gains, shares still look undervalued, trading with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E ) ratio of just 20, well below its 10-year average P/E of 25 and industry P/E average of 35.Market Cap: $32 billion 1-Year Gain: 34% Institutional ownership: 98.91% Market Cap: $32 billion1-Year Gain: 34%Institutional ownership: 98.91%Priceline, an online travel deals specialist, has been another high flyer, up 34% in the past year and 48% in the last two. Thisbullish movement has been fueled by strong interest from the smartest money on the Street, with institutional ownership clocking in at an impressive 98.8%. But like Gilead, Priceline is anearnings powerhouse, with analysts projecting full-year earnings of $35.95 per share in 2013.So in spite of its nominally high share price currently hovering around $650, Priceline is trading with a price-to-earnings/growth (PEG ) ratio of just 0.8, safely below thebenchmark of 1 for value.Risks to Consider:  These 10 stocks have the highest institutional ownership in the S&P 500. This means the smartest money on the Street thinks shares are set to move higher, giving investors an opportunity tocash in on more bullish movement. But out of the group, Priceline and Gilead also look undervalued relative to historic levels and their peers in spite of bullish earnings projections going into 2013. That should provide extra support these two stocks.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@The Smart Money Loves These 10 Stocks@2013-01-14@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/smart-money-loves-these-10-stocks-2013-01-14
 (  ) recently announced the acquisition of Estonia-based Modesat Communications, which specializes in backhaul modem solutions for microwave, E-band and NLOS (non-line of sight) markets, for an undisclosed sum.Employing fifeteen people, Xilinx also has office in San Diego, California, which will continue operations after the acquisition as well.Post integration, the combined product portfolio of Xilinx will enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) focusing on mobile backhaul platforms to gain market competitiveness and product differentiation.Xilinx' solutions provide fast and efficient alternatives for OEMs, who are constrained with respect to limited merchant IP options as customers can retain their proprietary IP, while deploying backhaul solutions and the flexibility of Xilinx All Programmable FPGAs and SoC devices to move its products to the market faster.The OEMs continue to show increasing interest in e-Band and NLOS backhaul technologies, beyond traditional microwave backhaul. Hence, the acquisition should benefit Xilinx to capitalize on this demand.Earlier, Xilinx acquired PetaLogix, a supplier of embedded Linux solutions. The company will now be able to offer the best-in-class, improved and modified Linux solutions to its clients with the help of PetaLogix's advanced PetaLinux technology.Management believes that the PetaLogix acquisition will establish the company firmly in the vertical market and will substantially strengthen its position in the embedded market. PetaLogix is largely responsible for augmenting the demand of Xilinx's programmable techniques in the embedded market.Previously, PetaLogix distributed Linux solutions for various processors such as MicroBlaze and PowerPC and now with the acquisition, it will provide Linux solutions and techniques to the Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC.Xilinx designs and manufactures a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex-programmable logic devices (CPLDs). Xilinx is a key semiconductor supplier to the leading OEMs in wireless mobile backhaul markets.We currently maintain an Underperform recommendation on the stock.

icrochip maker Xilinx, Inc. (  ) late Wednesday posted mixed fiscal second quarter earnings and provided a weak third quarter sales outlook.The San Jose, CA-based company reported fiscal second quarter net income of $123.4 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with $126.3 million, or 47 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Revenue slipped 2% from last year to $543.9 million.On average, Wall Street analysts expected a smaller profit of 41 cents per share, albeit on higher revenue of $548 million.Looking ahead, XLNX forecast fiscal third quarter sales to fall 1% to 5% on a sequential basis, implying revenue of $516.7 million to $548.5 million. Analysts are currently looking for a much-higher $562 million in revenue for the current period.Xilinx shares were unchanged in premarket trading Thursday.Shares of Xilinx (  ) have a 2.59% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $33.96. The stock has technical support in the $30-$31 price area.

 (  ) reported earnings per share of 46 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. However, the quarterly earnings failed to surpass the year-ago earnings as well as the prior quarter earnings of 47 cents a share. Net income declined 5% sequentially and 2% year over year to $123.4 million.California-based Xilinx Inc. is engaged in designing and manufacturing a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex-programmable logic devices (CPLDs).The company reported total sales of $543.9 million, down 2% year over year and 7% sequentially, but in line with management's guidance. The overall decline was attributable to weaker-than-anticipated sales from industrial and Aerospace and defense and computer and data processing, offset somewhat by better-than-expected sales from wireless communications.Geographically, the company's sales were down sequentially across all regions except Japan. New product sales increased 7% sequentially, driven by higher sales of 28 nanometer families, partially offset by flat 40 nanometer sales. Revenues from 28 nanometer surpassed management's target of $20 million.Mainstream products increased 3% during the quarter, driven by strength from the Virtex-5 products, attributable to LTE deployment activity. Base products declined by almost 20% sequentially, due to soft industrial, defense and communications segment performance.Sales from communications in data center increased 3% sequentially, driven by strong wireless sales, which more than offset expected declines in wireline. Broadcast, consumer and automotive sales declined 15% sequentially as sales from all categories were flat to down sequentially.Gross margin decreased to 65.5% from 66.0% in the previous quarter but was up from 63.9% in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to continued focus on yield improvement and cost reduction, which offset significant impact from customer and product mix during the quarter. Operating margin decreased to 27.2% from 28.2% in the previous quarter and 27.9% in the year-ago quarter, despite lower expenses.During the quarter, Xilinx generated $197.4 million of cash from operations and incurred $7.6 million in capital expenditures. Xilinx paid $58 million in cash dividends. Xilinx ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term investments of $1.7 billion, flat with the previous quarter. Days sales outstanding decreased by 3 days to 35 days. Inventory increased by $11 million sequentially to $204.0 million.Xilinx stated that the backlog entering into the December quarter was down sequentially. In addition, management estimates that continued macroeconomic uncertainty may result in unpredictable customer ordering patterns. Sales of base and mainstream products will likely decline. Nevertheless, Xilinx, which competes with  (  ), expects continued growth from new products. Consequently, Xilinx expects sales to be down 1% to 5% sequentially in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and sales from all geographies are projected to decrease.Gross margin is forecasted around 66%, marginally up from the September quarter, primarily due to improving customer mix. Operating expenses in the December quarter are expected to be approximately $224 million, including approximately $3 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.Meanwhile, owing to the uncertain business environment, Xilinx is taking steps to reduce headcount and lower discretionary spending. The weak macroeconomic environment affected sales for the September quarter and has also resulted in lower-than-seasonal guidance for the December quarter.The weak guidance drove a 0.56% decrease in the share price in the aftermarket hours trading to close at $33.77. Earlier, the stock, gained 0.65% to close at $33.96 in regular trading.We maintain an Underperform recommendation on Xilinx in the long run.

e continue to maintain a Neutral recommendation on  (  ) ahead of its third quarter 2012 results, expected on October 23, 2012.Last month, Altera updated its guidance for the third quarter of 2012. Altera expects revenue growth of 2% - 6% on a sequential basis, in line with the guidance provided during the second quarter results. This implies a revenue guidance of $437.5 million - $452.9 million.Altera continues to see traction in the 28-nanometer node and expects revenue from this node to exceed $20 million in the third quarter. Revenue from 40-nanometer node is also expected to grow sequentially.New products are expected to be the growth drivers for the third quarter with sales of both 40nm and 28nm products estimated to rise substantially.End-market wise, Telecom and Wireless markets are expected to witness growth. Industrial Automation, Military and Automotive segment is also expected to increase, driven primarily by Military and Automotive. Networking, Computer and Storage is expected to be down.Earnings estimates for fiscal 2012 have been static over the last few days as the company reiterated its guidance for the third quarter.In July, Altera reported better-than-expected second quarter results. Altera reported a net income of $162.7 million or 50 cents per diluted share, which easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents per share.Altera returned to sequential quarterly growth after three quarters of pullback in customer inventory. Most customers ended their inventory destocking programs and returned to their normal purchase levels.On an average, Altera has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.95% in the last four quarters. We expect the company to report in line results for the third quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter 2012 is 46 cents with no movement in either direction in the last sixty days.Altera has a robust pipeline of 28 nanometer products, which it believes will maintain the growth momentum in the upcoming quarters.

The reiterated guidance implies a revenue guidance of $437.5 million - $452.9 million.Management stated that the company will post strong sequential growth from its 40-nm and 28-nm products. Growth is projected to be broad based across the company's vertical markets.Earlier, Altera reported disappointing results for the first quarter of 2012. The company reported sales of $383.8 million in the first quarter of 2012, down 16% sequentially and 28% year over year.The reported revenues missed management's revised guidance range of $416.5 million - $425.9 million.Management stated that the decline in Altera's first-quarter revenue was more severe than the company's expectation. This was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand late in the quarter by Telecom and Wireless customers. This end market is the largest vertical market for the company. Consequently, orders did not come in as the company expected and the company also faced product mix issues in its industrial business.The sequential decline in revenues was due to a continued inventory reduction across most markets along with weakness in the communications end market.Nevertheless, Altera was encouraged by the strong bookings in March as inventory correction by most customers was almost over. The company has also stocked up buffer inventories to ease supply constraints faced in the March quarter.Altera has a pipeline of 28 nanometer products, which should help it sustain growth levels. We believe the company has an edge over its competitor  (  ) at the 40nm and 28 nm node. Hence, the company might be able to revive growth earlier than expected.We expect business to revive in the second half of 2012 and hence maintain our Neutral recommendation.

The growth was driven by strength in Asia Pacific, particularly in communications applications. As expected, North America was weak due to softness in defense and industrial, scientific and medical.New product sales increased 31% sequentially driven by sales increases from 28-, 40-, 45-nanometer products. Sales of 28-nanometer products grew significantly in the quarter, surpassing management's target of $10 million. The company now expects sales to exceed $20 million in the September quarter.

The reiterated guidance implies a revenue guidance of $437.5 million - $452.9 million.Management stated that the company will post strong sequential growth from its 40-nm and 28-nm products. Growth is projected to be broad based across the company's vertical markets.However, estimates continue to maintain a downward trend. Of the twenty-one analysts covering the stock, four have reduced their estimates in the last seven days while seven in the last thirty days.Altera has missed estimates twice in the last fourth quarters and hence analysts continue to be sceptical about the company's performance.The decline in Altera's first-quarter revenue was more severe than the company's expectation. This was primarily due to a significant decrease in demand late in the quarter by Telecom and Wireless customers. This end market is the largest vertical market for the company. Consequently, orders did not come in as Altera expected and the company also faced certain product mix issues in its industrial business.Nevertheless, Altera was encouraged by the strong bookings in March as inventory correction by most customers was almost over. The company has also stocked up buffer inventories to ease supply constraints faced in the March quarter.Altera has a pipeline of 28 nanometer products, which should help it sustain growth levels. We believe the company has an edge over its competitor  (  ) at the 40nm and 28 nm node. Hence, the company might be able to revive growth earlier than expected.We expect business to revive in the second half of 2012 and hence maintain our Neutral recommendation.

We believe the inventory correction in the supply chain is almost complete and the company should return to growth by the second quarter of calendar 2012.This is in sharp contrast to key competitor,  (  ), where estimates have declined in the last few days driven by weak results.Xilinx is uniquely positioned to capitalize on incremental growth opportunities offered by its leadership in 28nm products and innovative platform-based architectures. The ramp-up in 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer products will open a host of new markets, and replacement of ASICs will take place in a more aggressive way.As of now, we await further clarity and maintain our Neutral recommendation on Xilinx.

The reported earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.37 per share.Earnings estimates for fiscal 2012 and the fourth quarter have increased significantly thereafter in the last sixty days.Xilinx reported sales of $511.1 million were down 10% year over year and 8% sequentially, better than management's revised guidance range of $510.8 million to $538.5 million.Xilinx stated that it expects strong growth from 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer product families in the March quarter. Consequently, Xilinx expects sales to be up 2% to up 6% sequentially. Sales from Europe are expected to increase, sales from Asia-Pacific expected to decrease and sales from North America and Japan to be approximately flat.We continue to be sceptical as prime rival  (  ) recently narrowed its guidance for the March quarter citing a more pronounced and broader than anticipated inventory adjustment related weakness leading to a more significant decline.Nevertheless, we continue to maintain a Neutral recommendation on Xilinx.

"hree different semiconductor stocks, three different ways of looking at a pullback.Leader of the semiconductor pack,  (  ) has traded lower for the past two days in a row, but is not yet in technically oversold territory. Trading down to new, two-week lows after pulling back by more than half percent on Wednesday, INTC actually has been under the sway of sellers for most of the past week, finishing down for four out of the past six sessions.But traders may want to wait for additional profit-taking in INTC before wading in on the long side. The stock's short-term edge is actually a negative as of Wednesday's close. And even with a one-point ratings upgrade, shares of Intel are trading with  as of middday Wednesday.Another story entirely is the plunge in  (  ). SanDisk began selling off after hours on Tuesday, and opened lower by more than 8% Wednesday morning.Despite rallying over the previous two days, SNDK had been moving generally lower since reaching new, two-week highs in late March. The Wednesday pullback has not only taken the stock back into technically oversold territory, but sent shares of SNDK below their 200-day moving average.SNDK's plunge into bear market territory may invalidate the stock from consideration for many traders uninterested in buying stocks below their 200-day moving average. This is not without good reason. The 200-day moving average is a sound and quantified ""line in the sand"" when trading stocks and ETFs, and the fact that SanDisk doesn't have a higher rating than a neutral, 5 out of 10, is in part a reflection of the fact that the stock is trading in bear market territory.That said, the short-term oversold character of SNDK cannot be denied. The stock has a short-term, positive edge of more than two and a half percent, and is trading near the same levels where it broke out back above its 200-day moving average in mid-October 2011.So if Intel is still too cool and, for some traders, SanDisk too hot, is there a semiconductor stock that is just right? Traders and more active investors may want to focus on stocks from this sector that are not only  into short-term oversold territory (as SanDisk is), but are also trading well within bull market territory above their 200-day moving averages.An example of such a stock is  (  ). Trading in bull market territory since late January, shares of AMD have slipped into a three-week, trading range near multi-month highs.Pulling back by more than 2%, Advanced Micro Devices has fallen to new, two-week lows for a second day in a row, and is back at technically oversold levels. The stock earned a one-point ratings upgrade to 7 out of 10 midway through Wednesday's session, just below our ""consider buying"" category, and a  of almost one percent in the short-term.Other stocks with comparably strong ratings and positive, short-term edges in this sector include  (  ) and  (  ).(Read our recent coverage of the sector in our  column for Wednesday,  .)

 (  ) declared senior notes pricing of its 1.75% Senior Notes with principal amount $500 million, due to mature in 2017. The company is likely to close the transaction on May 8, 2012.Book-running managers currently acting for this notes offering are J.P. Morgan Securities L.L.C., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC.The net proceeds from the offering along with its cash balances shall be used to repay the company's outstanding loans of nearly $500 million which would then result in the termination of Altera's Credit Agreement, dated August 31, 2007.The company declared quite a weakened performance in its first quarter financial results of 2012, reported on April 19, 2012. Revenues dropped around 28% annually to reach $384 million in the quarter. Margins were under pressure too as operating margin declined substantially from 45.8% in the year-ago quarter to 30.4% in the first quarter of 2012.Furthermore, the company pertains to an industry where ominous competition is prevalent. It should stay cautious of big players such as  (  ) and  (  ) as it traverses through 2012.Moving forward, the company is hopeful of strong recovery in the upcoming quarter of 2012 where it expects sales to be within the range of $437.5 million - $452.9 million, rising approximately 14% - 18% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal years 2012 and 2013 stands at $1.69 and $2.15, representing 27.91% year over year decline and 27.08% growth, respectively.In the short run, the stock bears a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating.

e recently reiterated our Neutral recommendation on  (  ) ahead of the company's third quarter results.The company is scheduled to report results on January 19, 2012. In December, Xilinx revised its sales guidance for the December quarter. The company now expects sales to decline by 9% - 12%, significantly lower than the previous guidance of a sales decline of 3% to 8% sequentially.The new guidance implies sales to come between $488.6 million and $505.2 million compared to the previous estimate of $538.5 million and $510.8 million.The decline in sales was primarily driven by a decrease in large customer business in Communications end market. The slowdown in China has affected the top-line both for Xilinx and rival  (  ). In addition, weak economic conditions in Europe are likely to hurt the company's sales.Xilinx's advancement in 28nm FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) is being offset by its continued weakness in the wired Communications and Industrial segment revenues.Xilinx now expects gross margin to be approximately 65%, up from the previous estimate of 64%. However, we expect margins to remain under pressure due to lower yields associated with ramp of new 40nm products.On a positive note, we expect Xilinx to regain market share on 28nm node at the end of inventory correction due to a faster product rollout and broader offerings. The company should post stronger growth in 2012.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xilinx is $1.75, down by $0.06 in the last thirty days. Earnings estimates have declined significantly in the last quarter, forcing us to remain on sidelines.Hence, we maintain our Neutral recommendation on the stock.

The top line was impacted by particularly weak business from large communications customers, but came in better than management's expectation primarily due to increased business from large communication customers in Asia-Pacific and North America during the last two weeks of the quarter.Mainstream products decreased 1% sequentially and base products were flat sequentially. New Product sales decreased 13% sequentially but increased 5% on a year-over-year basis. This category was impacted by declines from Virtex-5 customers in the wireless segment. Virtex-6, Spartan-6 and 28-nanometer product families all posted solid sales growth during the quarter.Gross margin increased to 65.8% from 63.9% in the prior quarter and was better-than-management's expectations primarily due to favourable customer mix and and continued overall cost reduction.Operating margin decreased to 26.8% from 27.8% in the previous quarter and from 32.3% in the year-ago quarter.During the quarter, Xilinx generated $181 million of cash from operations and used $19 million in capital expenditures. Xilinx paid $50 million in cash dividends and repurchased 1.1 million shares for $32.5 million.Xilinx ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term investments of $1.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Days sales outstanding increased by 3 days to 38 days. Inventory declined by $2.2 million sequentially.Xilinx, which competes with Altera Corporation (  ), expects strong growth from 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer product families in the March quarter. Consequently, Xilinx expects sales to be up 2% to up 6% sequentially. Sales from Europe are expected to increase, sales from Asia-Pacific expected to decrease and sales from North America and Japan to be approximately flat.Gross margin is forecasted around 64% - 65% as the company absorbs new product ramp costs and customer mix returns to normal historical level. Operating expenses in the March quarter are expected to be approximately $207 million, including approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.The better-than-expected results and upbeat guidance drove a 7.17% increase in the share price in after market hours trading to close at $37.83.

arnings estimates for  (  have declined significantly in the last three months, driven by weak macroeconomic conditions.All the twenty-two firms covering the stock have lowered their estimates in the last thirty days pulling down the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011. This was prompted by the company's cut in outlook for the fourth quarter.Last month, the company slashed its revenue guidance. Altera now expects revenues in the fourth quarter to decline by 13% to 16% on a sequential basis, compared to the previous guidance of 7% - 11%. The new guidance implies revenues in the range of $438.9 million - $454.6 million, significantly lower than the previous guidance of $465.0 million - $485.9 million.Altera stated that the revenue outlook has deteriorated across all major vertical markets, including both large and small customers. Only North America is expected to benefit from rising military sales. All other geographies are expected to be weak. Most customers reduced demand due to economic uncertainty, macroeconomic concerns, and lower than planned sales.This is the second instance where Altera lowered its revenue guidance in the past few quarters against its usual practice of upgrading guidance as the quarter progresses.The reduction in guidance was driven by industry-wide inventory correction and weak demand, which continue to pla gue companies in the semiconductor industry.The same sentiment was echoed by key rival  (  ) as well, which also trimmed its forecast for the December quarter.The firms pulled back their estimates for Altera citing weak demand in China and the European wireless segment and believe that it is highly unlikely that the company will bounce back before 2Q12. A significant cause of concern is Altera's higher exposure to China and service provider segments. The macroeconomic slowdown in China is hurting Altera more than Xilinx as Altera has more exposure to China than Xilinx.Given the turbulent economic environment, we continue to be on the sidelines and await better clarity on business development as the year progresses. Hence, we maintain our Neutral recommendation on Altera.

arnings estimates for  (  ) have declined considerably in the last seven days after the company provided weak guidance for the first quarter of 2012.Although fourth-quarter results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.04, the guidance was disappointing.Altera expects sales to be down 5% - 9% sequentially. This implies a revenue guidance of $416.5 million - $434.9 million. Management stated that the program timing in the Military business will account for half of the decline. The company expects revenues from wireless segment to be down across multiple geographies due to continued inventory depletion and softening of demand in the second half of 2011.Consequently, out of twenty-three analysts covering the stock, eighteen have lowered their estimates in the last seven days leading to a sharp decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012.In contrast, the company's rival  (  ) provided a positive guidance expecting sales to increase sequentially.Most analysts believe that Altera will lose market share to Xilinx in the first half of 2012. As per the analysts, XLNX likely benefited from a higher exposure to  (  ) and LTE at Ericsson, while ALTR was disproportionately impacted by weakness in China/wireless.Altera has a large exposure to the telecommunications industry, in particular China. The recent slowdown in China has adversely impacted the company's business with no respite, at least in the forthcoming quarter. Moreover, margins have already peaked recently and might not be sustainable in the long run. We expect a decline in margins going forward.Therefore, we downgrade our recommendation to Underperform from Neutral.

The decline in revenues in the fourth quarter was due to inventory reduction in the broad end market along with a slowdown in markets such as wireless and test. Nevertheless, military grew significantly in the quarter but Computer Storage declined due to the end of the earthquake-related ASIC replacement business. Stratix V revenue increased 49% sequentially.Moving onto margins, gross margin came in at 70.1% compared to 68.0% in the previous quarter and 71.0% in the year-ago quarter.

Now it's making its mark with Motorola.Google's acquisition of Motorola means it can produce mobile devices at competitive prices, complete with all the innovation that helps to define the company. Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc (MMI) has already started to reap in the benefits, as shares of MMI jumped 36.70% upon news of the acquisition, from $24.47 at its Friday close to $38.66 on Monday's open.The implications of the acquisition are brilliant. While people are moving towards a mobile-media-centered lifestyle (tablets, smart phones, and who knows what's next), Google stepped in to give Apple a run for their money.

"he market fought hard to hold on to slight gains for the day, as many investors had a watchful eye on oil and gold prices. Despite reassurances from the Saudi government, the stock markets there have been down for 13 straight days. Investors there are certainly concerned.Metlife (  ) was one of the names trading lower on news of a large share offering for the insurance giant. Costco (  ) was also down following the wholesaler's disappointing earnings release. In contrast, shares of semiconductor play Altera Corp (  ) was higher after the company reaffirmed estimates. We saw the rally in those shares carry over to competitors Texas Instruments (  ) and Xilinx (  ). You can bet traders will be gun-shy and have one hand on the sell button on any signs the early rally will give way.We continue to be proactive with our recommended list as we made another downgrade this morning. Be sure to check out the  t if you did not read the e-mail alert we sent out earlier.Everyone that reads my daily newsletter (nearly 18,000 now - Thank You So Much!) knows I have been very critical of the business media recently, due to its focus mostly on day trading. The lure is too easy to grab the latest headline and spin it to get viewers to stay tuned in during the next commercial break. There were some media metrics out from Nielsen Media Research yesterday showing CNBC's viewership fell 25 percent during the business day in February. Here we are in a market that has risen from 660 on the S&P to over 1300 the last two years (granted we went from 1400 to 660 before that). When you cater your message to an industry where the success rate is possibly as low as 10% (daytrading), sooner or later your audience will begin to erode. Part of my drive in growing Dividend.com is to get us back to the basics and lose the ""trading is sexy"" mantra that puts most people's portfolios in danger. We'll see if the ratings drop will spur more initiatives to get programming back toward benefiting investing and away from trading. I'm not holding my breath.The White House recently released a report saying women earned about 75% as much as male counterparts at all levels of education. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, the ratio of women's earnings to men's earnings rose to 89% in 2009 from 68% in 1979, while for 45- to 54-year-olds the ratio gained to 74% from 57%. These are long overdue strides we are seeing, and this comes as no surprise to us here at Dividend.com, where we are seeing an ever-growing female subscriber base.Regardless of gender, everyone's financial goals should be just about the same. Taking advantage of tax-advantaged retirement accounts (IRAs, 401k's) is a huge plus. Don't be afraid to make mistakes in investing, as we all need to learn from them. I just don't want to see or hear from anyone that they lost money investing in penny stocks. That's a simple investing premise you need to promise yourself you will never delve into.Consulting with a financial planner as well as a tax professional is another way to educate yourself and feel more secure in your decisions. Don't get hung up on real estate when it comes to buying or renting. I am from the school of renting early on in life. Renting puts much less pressure on your finances, and you don't have to worry about losing your home if you have financial difficulties. Lastly, don't ever think you are too old to make an impact with saving for retirement. The minute you give up is the minute you hand over your financial direction to the government in your later years. That's the last thing you ever want to do. Two years of social security freezes should open your eyes to what things are like for older people that rely mostly on the government for their well-being. Remember, if you just turned 50 and you looked at your income statement and there is nothing but a $0 at the bottom of the page, you still have plenty of time to build a solid nest egg. For instance, you can start maxing out a Roth IRA contribution ($5K/year currently, but in addition to the ""standard"" contribution limits, taxpayers age 50 and over are eligible to make a Roth IRA ""catch-up"" contribution of an additional $1K/year). If you were to invest $5K per year for every year in your 50s, each $5K you invest would turn into more than $40K after 20 years. So you see, it's never too late to get started!There are opportunities all around us to improve our financial situation, from a better job to a better education, or just simply following sites like ours (or other financial newsletters and magazines). It's on us to reach for the solution - it won't just fall into our laps. The choices you make will dictate your direction. Do you decide to turn off the TV for a change and start reading? Do you go to a book store instead of going to the movie theater? Do you wake up 1 hour earlier to get online and research the areas that can make your fortunes change?I am not going to allow you to let up when it comes to staying on the right track for your financial future. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you tomorrow! P.S.

"Shutterstock photoDespite plunging to a triple-digit loss early in the session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) came roaring back to finish Tuesday with a gain of roughly 75 points. The bulls are looking to extend the rally this morning, drawing strength from strong earnings from Apple Inc. and expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke may announce policy accommodation measures in testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee later today. The DJIA could find resistance out of the gate this morning, with former support at the 10,250 level looming large as a potential hurdle. Above this area, the 10,400 level could cap any extended rallies by the blue-chip barometer. As for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), the index rebounded from its May ""flash crash"" low yesterday, and is now challenging former support/resistance near 1,085. Should the SPX push past this hurdle, longer-term resistance remains overhead at the 1,100 level. Heading into the open, the DJIA and the SPX are trading 13 points and 2.5 points above fair value, respectively, pointing toward a flat-to-higher open.In earnings news, Apple Inc. (  ) said that strong demand for iPhones and iPads lifted third-quarter earnings to $3.25 billion, or $3.51 per share, compared with earnings of $1.83 billion, or $2.01 per share, last year. Revenue soared 61% to $15.7 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $3.11 per share on revenue of $14.75 billion. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Apple said it expects revenue of $18 billion with earnings of $3.44 per share, versus Wall Street's view for earnings of $3.82 per share on revenue of $17.03 billion. AAPL shares are up nearly 4% in pre-market trading.Elsewhere, Yahoo! Inc. (  ) reported second-quarter net income of $213.3 million, or 15 cents per share, on revenue of $1.13 billion. Analysts had expected Yahoo! to post earnings of 14 cents per share on $1.16 billion in net revenue. YHOO was off nearly 7% in electronic trading at last check.Finally, EMC Corp. (  ) reported a second-quarter profit of $426 million, or 20 cents per share, as sales rose 24% to $4.02 billion. Earnings, excluding one-time items, came in at 28 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 28 cents per share on sales of $3.99 billion. Looking ahead, EMC said it expects to exceed its prior 2010 sales outlook of $16.5 billion. Still, EMC shares are off roughly 1.3% in pre-market trading.On the earnings front Abbott Laboratories (  ), The Coca-Cola Co. (  ), Wells Fargo & Co. (  ), Baidu Inc. (  ), CA Inc. (  ), eBay Inc. (  ), Netflix Inc. (  ), QUALCOMM Inc. (  ), Starbucks Corp. (  ), Western Digital Corp. (  ), and Xilinx Inc. (  ) are scheduled to release their quarterly earnings report today.

"Shutterstock photoWhile large-cap semiconductor stocks, such as industry giant Intel Corp. (  ), have struggled to maintain a positive bias during the past year, small-cap and mid-cap chip firms are performing quite well. Overall, the Semiconductor HOLDRS Trust (  ) has added more than 25% during the past 52 weeks, with the exchange-traded fund (  ) rising roughly 4% year-to-date. By comparison, INTC's performance has been flat during the same time frames, with the stock down about 0.4% since the start of 2011, and up 0.53% in the past year.Despite this disparity in performance, INTC and its fellow large-cap stocks have garnered the bulk of the sector's bullish sentiment. For instance, only about 53% of the 1,169 analysts covering SMH stocks rate them a ""buy"" or better, compared to nearly 60% of the 42 brokerage firms following INTC. Additionally, SMH's short-to-float ratio arrives at a whopping 51%, versus less than 1% for Intel. Given the sector's overall strength, and Intel's relative weakness, there could be plenty of bullish opportunities among the smaller semiconductor stocks.With a market capitalization of roughly $8.19 billion, Xilinx Inc. (  ) is large by mid-cap standards, but is dwarfed by Intel's market capitalization -- a whopping $116.78 billion. However, its smaller size has allowed XLNX to be considerably more nimble, with the company posting a Street-beating 42% jump in third-quarter earnings after the close on Jan. 19. The better-than-expected report extended the company's fiscal winning streak, with XLNX having bested the consensus estimate in each of the prior four reporting periods.XLNX is no slouch in terms of price action, either. During the past 52 weeks, the shares have rallied more than 24%, with the stock adding nearly 8% since the start of 2011. The equity has also broken out to a series of multi-year highs, bolstered by support at its 10-day and 20-day moving averages. XLNX is currently consolidating those gains just above its 10-day trendline, as it weathers the recent spike in market volatility.Despite this strong price action, investors have remained stubbornly bearish on the security. Among options traders, the stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) arrives at 1.37, as puts outnumber calls among near-term options. This ratio also arrives just one percentage point shy of an annual peak, pointing toward an extreme in bearish sentiment.What's more, put buying is growing in popularity on the International Securities Exchange (ISE) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (  ). During the prior two weeks, 1.38 XLNX puts were bought to open for every one call purchased, resulting in a 10-day ISE/CBOE put/call volume ratio of 1.38. This ratio ranks above 60% of all those taken in the past year, meaning that options traders have rarely snapped up puts over calls at a faster pace in the past year.Analysts are also betting against XLNX, as 16 of the 24 brokerage firms following the shares rate them a ""hold"" or worse. The firm's consensus 12-month price target of $30.28, as reported by  , also suggests a lack of confidence from the analyst community, as XLNX closed at $31.26 on Thursday. As such, any upgrades or price-target increases could provide additional buying pressure.Finally, short interest rose by more than 13% during the prior month, resulting in about 30.7 million XLNX shares sold short. With a short-to-float ratio of 11.87%, the equity has plenty of fuel for a potential short-covering rally as it extends its current uptrend. Traders looking to take advantage of this strong price action should consider the stock's March 31 call.Sporting a market capitalization of roughly $11.78 billion, Altera Corp. (ALTR) is carrying a few more pounds around the middle than Xilinx. After the close on Tuesday, Jan. 25, Altera is expected to post a fourth-quarter profit of 71 cents per share, more than doubling last year's earnings of 34 cents per share for the same period. Historically, the company has bested Wall Street's expectations in each of the prior four reporting periods, with an average upside surprise of roughly 14.5%.Technically, ALTR is by far the best performing of today's focus stocks, with the shares soaring nearly 70% during the past year. Additionally, the equity has extended its strong price action into 2011, gaining almost 6% since the start of the year. The stock's 10-week moving average has provided a helping hand since September 2010, with ALTR trending steadily higher along this intermediate-term trendline during this time frame. What's more, the stock's recent pullback to this moving average could mark an excellent entry point for bullish investors ahead of the company's quarterly report.On the sentiment front, ALTR bears are in full retreat ahead of the company's turn in the earnings spotlight. Although puts are quite popular, with the equity's SOIR of 1.46 ranking above 63% of all those taken during the past year, ALTR's ISE/CBOE 10-day call/put volume ratio has ballooned to 8.02, meaning that more than eight calls have been bought to open for every one put purchased in the prior two weeks. This ratio also ranks above 98% of all those taken in the past year.While additional attention to ALTR calls could be a sign of buying strength, contrarians will want to be alert to a bullish frenzy ahead of the company's earnings report, as it could be a sign that speculators have raised the bar.There is also room for potential upgrades on ALTR. According to data from  , 14 of the 24 analysts following the shares still rate them a ""hold"" or worse. Upgrades from this group of holdouts could bring more buyers to the table. Traders looking to take advantage of an extended rally by the equity should consider a March 35 call.One final semiconductor stock to consider is Linear Technology Corp. (LLTC). While the company's market cap of $7.83 billion ranks it below the rest of today's focus stocks, Linear proved that it could be more nimble than most of its competitors earlier this week. Specifically, on Tuesday, Jan. 18, the company announced that its second-quarter net income nearly doubled to $143.7 million, or 62 cents per share. Revenue rose over 50% to $383.6 million. The results easily topped the consensus estimate for earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $379.7 million.Technically speaking, the stock is on solid footing, having rallied more than 22% during the prior 52 weeks. The shares have run into some turmoil in 2011, gaining a mere 0.8% year-to-date, but LLTC still maintains key support at its rising 10-week and 20-week moving averages. Currently, the shares are consolidating into the former of these intermediate-term trendlines, creating a bit of a trading range between the $34 and $35 levels. However, with the stock's 10-week moving average pushing into the region, LLTC could be on the verge of another leg higher in its longer-term rally.Checking in with investor sentiment, options traders remain quite bearish toward LLTC, with the stock's SOIR of 1.03 arriving above 85% of all those taken in the past year. Furthermore, the security's 10-day ISE/CBOE put/call volume ratio of 1.06 ranks in the 73rd percentile of its annual range.Finally, short interest accounts for a respectable 6.07% of the stock's total float, providing ample fuel for a potential short-covering rally that could amplify any breakout rally for LLTC. Given this data, investors might want to consider a May 32 call to take advantage of a potential unwinding of this negativity.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."@A Closer Look at...

hile  shares remain relatively unchanged in comparison to the broad-market weakness out of the gate on Wednesday, an options investor boosted call volume during morning trading to express moderate bearishness.At 10:42, roughly  , which was the mid-price when these options hit the tape. These calls are home to current open interest of 1,100 contracts, indicating the majority of this volume was likely initiated to open. The options action suggests at least one investor sold these calls on a bet that XLNX shares will not be trading higher than $27.60 at July options expiration in 30 days. If the stock hits a ceiling and does not rally higher than the breakeven, this short call trade caps maximum gain at the premium collected, or 60 cents per contract. On the other hand, if XLNX shares are trading higher than the breakeven price, this strategy could theoretically incur unlimited losses as the stock moves to the upside. A short call play like this limits profits but takes on more risk to call for limited upside prior to the expiration month. It's interesting that the investor does not expect XLNX shares to rally much higher prior to the company's earnings announcement (the market expects the report around July 21).XLNX did not announce any news today, and the stock is relatively unchanged on the day around $26.37.Open a free    DOLE shares are relatively unchanged at $10.60 so far on the day. The stock reached a 52-week high of roughly $12.50 in March, and options action on the tape suggests at least one investor expects the stock to head closer to the recent highs prior to January 2011 options expiration.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) investor calls for limited upside@2010-07-15@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/xilinx-nasdaqxlnx-investor-calls-limited-upside-2010-07-15
"Shutterstock photoWhen officers and directors decide to buy their company's stock with their own cash, it's invariably seen as a bullish sign for shares. Yet when they decide to sell, investors need not necessarily be overly concerned. Perhaps shares have had a nice run and a little profit-taking by insiders is to be expected. Or maybe a few shares need to be sold to fund this month's mortgage payment. But when insiders dump large amounts of stock, even as that stock is racing toward the 52-week low, then investors should follow their lead and head for the exit as well. That's just what happened with  on Friday, pushing shares down -6%.During the past few days, it had become apparent that Micron's chairman and chief executive officer (  ) Steven Appleton, along with the company's president and two other insiders, collectively sold more than $1 million worth of stock on Wednesday, even after shares had been drifting steadily lower in recent weeks. While those insider sales amounted to 143,000 shares, ""outside"" investors voted with their feet Friday as more than 60 million shares changed hands.By all accounts, Micron's business is on the upswing. Sales and profits have surged in recent quarters, and Micron is on track to earn nearly $2 a share in the  ended August. That would be a company record. The company has pulled off a series of moves in recent months that will lighten expenses and diversify the customer base. For example, selling a 50% interest in a key Asian manufacturing facility should net Micron a $450 million cash infusion in August, bolstering an already-growing cash balance. Moreover,  announced earlier this month that demand for computers (which consume a lot of Micron's memory chips) is really taking off, setting the stage for robust chip sales into 2011.To be fair, all kinds of chip stocks are buckling under this week.  fell sharply on Thursday on no apparent news, while other chip makers such as  and  traded lower by lesser amounts. So this may be more about investor queasiness about tech spending than any actual negative industry actions taking place.But none of that bullish commentary matters if management acts so bearishly. Insiders at Micron may have unwittingly touched off misplaced fears that business is turning south. Sales and profit trends may indeed still be on the mend from the nadir of the economic crisis, but no matter how bullish Micron and its peers sound on the next round of conference calls, heavy insider selling may still be the most salient message to investors.Micron's trading action highlights an important step for investors: before buying, check out the latest insider moves. If you're looking at purchasing a stock and insiders are selling even as the stock is approaching lows, then hold off on that ""Buy"" order. And as in the case with Micron, when it's a cluster of insiders who are selling, be very leery.Insiders must file a copy of their activities with the U.S.  ) .

rogrammable Logic Devices (  ) maker  (  ) recently slashed its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011.Altera now expects revenues in the fourth quarter to decline by 13% to 16% on a sequential basis, compared to the previous guidance of 7% - 11%. The new guidance implies revenues in the range of $438.9 million - $454.6 million, significantly lower than the previous guidance of $465.0 million - $485.9 million.Altera stated that the revenue outlook has deteriorated across all major vertical markets, including both large and small customers. Only North America is expected to benefit from rising military sales. All other geographies are expected to be weak. Most customers reduced demand due to economic uncertainty, macroeconomic concerns, and lower than planned sales.This is the second instance where Altera lowered its revenue guidance in the past few quarters against its usual practice of upgrading guidance as the quarter progresses.Like its prime rival  (  ), Altera is also clearly having a tough time due to the slowdown in the economy. In the September quarter, Altera also lowered its revenue guidance due to weaker demand in several vertical markets including Telecom and Wireless (particularly outside Asia). In addition, Industrial Automation, Military, and Test were also weak as customers moderated their purchases in light of macroeconomic uncertainty and other near-term changes to their business environment.Xilinx also followed suit in the September quarter. For the December quarter, Xilinx has already estimated a 3% to 8% sequential decline. We now expect a more severe decline for Xilinx as well given the tough economic conditions being faced by most semiconductor companies.Concurrent with Altera, industry leader  (  ) slashed its revenue guidance for the December quarter as demand was adversely impacted with most customers bringing down their high-level of inventories. Texas stated that the reductions are due to broadly lower demand across a wide range of product markets, customers, end products, the only exception being wireless applications processors. In particular, recessionary environment in Europe continues to impact the business followed by Asia and the US.Last month, chipmaker  (  ) also cited demand being weak across end markets leading to a build-up in inventories across the supply chain. In fact, the company was one of the first semiconductor companies to lower expectations in the earnings cycle. The company believes the December quarter is likely to mark the bottom for both sales and earnings and growth will resume in the first quarter of 2012.Although most companies expect economic conditions to improve by the March quarter-end, the scenario doesn't appear bright to us at this point. The world economy seems to be in turmoil and recovery is expected to be gradual. With Europe in doldrums and Asia also getting impacted, order patterns will continue to be weak and bleak. We continue to be wary and stay clear of investing in this sector now.Meanwhile, the downgrade in guidance led to a 6.12% decline in Altera's stock price in after market-hours trading to close at $33.31.

While the trade reflects a belief the downside is limited, 4,230 July 26 calls were sold minutes later for $0.80, reflecting a belief that the upside is limited as well. XLNX rose 0.67 percent to $26.07 in late-morning trading and has been moving sideways since December. It's been a favorite among option traders in the last month, seeing both call selling by investors who think it has limited potential to rally and call buying on the part of the bulls.The company, which makes programmable chips, issued strong results and guidance on April 28.

 shares are currently roughly 5% off their 52-week high of $28 reached earlier this month. The company is slated to release results on Wednesday after the close, and analysts are looking for the company to have earned 45 cents in its fiscal fourth quarter. In trading today, the semiconductor industry is trading down along with the rest of the market as investors react to the impact of the Portuguese debt rating downgrade. A look at some call buying in XLNX suggests that an investor might be preparing for a move to the upside, or at least some volatility as a result of earnings.Around 12:43 p.m. EST this morning, an investor purchased 30,000 May 28 calls versus current open interest of just 1,386. The investors paid 32.5 cents for the calls when the stock was trading around $26.40.At first glance, this trade appears very bullish; it probably is. But a closer look shows that these options traded with stock, meaning the call buyer simultaneously sold shares to the option market maker. A look at the time and sales in XLNX shows that 660,000 shares traded at $26.40 around the time of the option trade. 660,000 is roughly the number of shares that market makers would need to buy to make this trade delta neutral, meaning the hedge ratio. The fact that the investor executed a delta-neutral trade could mean they are more interested in betting on volatility than direction. The 32.5-cent premium in the calls with the stock at $26.40 is an implied volatility of roughly 32%. The historical volatility for the last three months is 25%. If this investor thinks XLNX will make an unusual move on the earnings announcement, then purchasing options on an implied volatility of 32% will make money for the investor if they are hedged daily until expiration. I like to use my    We will find out starting tomorrow after the close just how much of a move XLNX has as a result of earnings.I think, however, that it is more likely that this trade is still bullish. This is because I think the investor has sold the stock to the option market makers to control the price jump in the stock caused by the market makers buying the stock in the open market. By doing so, the investor has managed to only purchase  from the market makers rather than delta. This enables the investor to get a cheaper options price because the option market makers do not have to take stock price risk at the time of the option sale. This action allows the investor to keep the purchase of the stock more anonymous. The investor may have bought the stock in the market prior to buying the calls hoping that the price paid for the shares will be less than what would be implied in the option price. The investor then sells the stock to the market makers and is left with the long calls.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.@Bullishness ahead of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) earnings@2010-04-27@https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bullishness-ahead-xilinx-nasdaq-xlnx-earnings-2010-04-27

t least one big investor has apparently given up hope in Xilinx.A trader started writing September calls on the maker of programmable microchips Monday and continued the selling campaign yesterday. Most of the activity focused on the September 25, 26, and 27 contracts. The September 27s mostly fetched $0.60 to $0.70 yesterday, down from $0.75 the previous session, according to optionMONSTER's tracking programs. The September 26 calls fell to a range of $0.85 to $0.95 from $1.20 to $1.30, and the September 25s changed hands for about $1.35 versus $1.75 on Monday.XLNX fell 0.58 percent to $24.15 yesterday. While the lower share price partially explains the lower option premiums, the value of the contracts fell much more than would have been indicated by their deltas. That reflects the heavy selling pressure on the calls.The trades reflect a belief that the stock has limited upside. It gapped higher on April 14 after Intel's bullish earnings report lifted the entire sector. It has fallen 13 percent since then, following other semiconductor stocks lower.
