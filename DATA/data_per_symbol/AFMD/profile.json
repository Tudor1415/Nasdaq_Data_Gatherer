Our product candidates\r\nrepresent an innovative approach to cancer treatment that seeks to harness the\r\nbody's own immune defenses to fight tumor cells. The most potent cells of the\r\nhuman defense arsenal are types of white blood cells called innate immune cells\r\n(Natural Killer cells, or NK cells, and macrophages) and T cells. Leveraging our\r\nfit-for-purpose ROCK\u00ae platform, we develop proprietary, next-generation\r\nbispecific antibodies, so-called innate cell engagers, which are designed to\r\ndirect innate immune cells and establish a bridge to cancer cells. Our innate\r\ncell engagers have the ability to bring innate immune cells into the proximity\r\nof tumor cells and trigger an activation cascade that leads to the destruction\r\nof cancer cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;... <a href=\"http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2f0001558370-20-004500.html#FIS_COMPANY_INFORMATION\" target=\"_blank\">More</a> ...&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n", "KeyExecutives": [{"name": "Adolf Hoess", "title": "Chief Executive Officer"}, {"name": "Andreas Harstrick", "title": "Chief Medical Officer"}, {"name": "Arndt Schottelius", "title": "Chief Scientific Officer"}, {"name": "Denise Mueller", "title": "Chief Business Officer"}, {"name": "Wolfgang Fischer", "title": "Chief Operating Officer"}], "Number_of_employees": ["NO INFO"], "Subsidiaries": ["NO INFO"]}
